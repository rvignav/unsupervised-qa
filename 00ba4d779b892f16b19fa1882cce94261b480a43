    "passage": "It was a one-of-a-kind moment of grace, humanity and compassion in the dominion of injustice and evil known as the military court of Judea, in the West Bank. In a spontaneous decision, Israel Prison Service officer Bassem Kashkush allowed Yafa and Suha Jarrar to approach their mother, Khalida, and embrace her. Even the elders of the court can’t remember anything like it.\n\n-   Palestinian MP's Crimes: Visiting Prisoners and Talking to the Media\n-   My Wife, the Jailed Palestinian MP\n\nThe young women walked up to their mother, hugged her long and hard, and the tears flowed unbidden. Mother and daughters cried; the husband and father, Ghassan Jarrar, wept bitterly. The sympathizers and international observers who are attending Jarrar’s trial cried, too, and a tear was even spotted in a female prison guard’s eye. “What’s this, is everyone crying here today?” she blurted out.\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Yafa hasn’t seen her mother for about a year, and her sister, Suha, 24, for about six months. Last week they arrived from Canada for a vacation. They are both graduate students, Yafa working toward a doctorate in law, Suha about to begin her Ph.D. in environmental studies, and this week they had an emotional reunion with their mother in court. Unlike in previous hearings, Jarrar was brought to the courtroom without iron shackles on her feet.\n\nKhalida Jarrar, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, has been in detention for almost three months. At first she was in administrative detention, as Israeli authorities had no intention of putting her on trial. But after a wave of international protest, she was remanded in custody until the conclusion of legal proceedings against her and indicted on 12 counts – all of them saliently political – which include such ludicrous charges as attending a book fair and visiting a released prisoner in his home. Her trial began this week in the Ofer military prison courtroom.\n\nInternationally, Jarrar is a story, but in Israel she’s a non-story. The judge, Lt. Col. Zvi Heilbron, like the prosecutor and the judge in the previous round of hearings, wears a skullcap. This military court increasingly resembles a synagogue.\n\nThe hearing this week was short and preliminary. “See you soon,” “We are proud of you,” the daughters cried out to their mother, before she was taken back to Sharon Prison.\n\nAfterward, in a splendid old house in Ramallah that belongs to a friend of the family, we spoke to the two impressive young women about their mother and father. Yafa and Suha, like many of their peers, are veterans of night raids on their home, when their father was taken away – he had been arrested no fewer than 14 times before their eyes – and their parents were humiliated. As the daughters of a left-wing Palestinian family, they are secular, modern in their outlook and very involved in the international campaign to obtain their mother’s release.\n\nSuha reinserted the stud in the piercing on her chin – she thought she wouldn’t be allowed to enter the courtroom with it. The family of another female prisoner brought them a present from their mother: cases for a lighter and for a pen, handcrafted in plastic by the most famous Palestinian prisoner in the world today, Khalida Jarrar, mother of Yafa and Suha, whose names are embroidered on the covers.\n\nSuha was born during one of her father’s incarcerations and saw him at home for the first time when she was three. When she visited him in prison, she could not reconcile the man in the photos with the person behind the iron bars. At the time, if a prisoner’s child was small enough, it could be handed to him through an opening.\n\nSuha remembers when she became too big to sit on her father’s knees. She remembers the cold Hebron prison and the long ride to the Ketziot facility, in the Negev desert. Dad would give them cookies he had baked in prison, in the shape of their initials.\n\nUntil 2002, which was the last time Ghassan was arrested, their childhood was marked by rough trips to different prisons. But what the daughters remember most vividly is the drum-like steps of the soldiers in the middle of the night, and the crude pounding on the door with rifle butts. They grew up thinking that this was the routine way of life of every child in the world.\n\nYafa, who left to begin her studies abroad a dozen years ago, recalls the winter of 1990. There was snow in Ramallah, the soldiers came again to take away her father, and she ran upstairs to get his gloves. She didn’t find them, only her mother’s, and she still carries a burden of guilt over the event. She was never afraid of the soldiers, she insists. There was only one time when Yafa was apprehensive: She had an orange lollipop in the cupboard, and the soldiers came at night to do a search. She was afraid they would take her candy. That didn’t happen.\n\n“She was only afraid for the lollipop, not for her father,” Ghassan recalls now, laughing.\n\nSuha, who has been gone for five years, remembers that during one of the arrests, she held onto the edge of her father’s pants and wouldn’t let go until the soldiers pried them apart. She was five at the time. The last time the Israel Defense Forces took her father out of his bed and took him away, she was 12. She remembers that she was sleeping on a mattress on the ground floor – they were afraid to sleep on the upper floor because of IDF snipers – pretending to be asleep, until a soldier kicked her to make her get up.\n\nSuha recalls that she saw her father putting on his shoes. When soldiers came at night and her father put on his shoes, she knew what was going to happen. She burst into tears. Her father tried to calm her – “Halas [enough], sweetie” – and Suha remembers a soldier imitating her father mockingly. She also remembers that they weren’t allowed to open the curtains in the bedroom. Once she did and a sniper’s bullet whistled past her.\n\nThe only time Suha was genuinely afraid, she says now, was last summer, when dozens of soldiers swooped into the house in order to present her mother with an order banishing her to Jericho. That night Ghassan was sleeping in his factory in Beit Furik, which manufactures colorful plush toys, and Yafa was in Canada. Khalida and Suha were alone in the house.\n\nSuha: “I was 23 already, and I can’t describe to you how helpless I felt, how frightened and scared I was. I was shaking all over when they came. I was always afraid of the moment when they would come to arrest my mother. At one point I even thought of throwing her off the balcony, because I was so afraid of what would happen to her. I remember telling the soldiers not to touch her cat. I told them that they didn’t have the right even to look at him. He’s so attached to Mom.”\n\nYafa: “It wasn’t until I studied human rights, in Canada, that I understood that they [IDF forces] had been using us as a human shield for years. They always ordered us to open the doors and closets for them. My Canadian lecturer told me, ‘You were a human shield.’”\n\nThe daughters were in Canada – Yafa in Regina, Saskatchewan, Suha in Ottawa – on April 2 when Khalida was arrested. It was evening in Canada and nighttime in Ramallah when Suha’s cellphone rang; it was her father calling, she saw on the screen. She was filled with foreboding. Had her mother been arrested? Maybe the cat had died? Suha took a deep breath and answered: “What happened, Dad?” He replied curtly: “They took Mom.”\n\nSuha, feeling her world had come unraveled, started to tremble.\n\nYafa was at work in Regina, waitressing. Her boyfriend arrived and said, “They arrested your mother.” It was still April 1 in Saskatchewan, and Yafa was certain that her friend James was pulling her leg.\n\nLast week, Yafa and Suha met in Frankfurt and from there went on to Ramallah. Suha: “We knew it would be hard to come back to a house without Mom. We have a homecoming routine: Dad waits at the bridge [Allenby Bridge, connecting Jordan to the West Bank], Mom cooks our favorite foods at home. Then we get into Dad’s car and call Mom and tell her we’ve crossed the bridge and we’re on the way. We get home and Mom is standing on the balcony, waving to us. Then we go up the stairs and hug and kiss, and give Mom the chocolates from the duty-free shop.\n\n“But this time only posters of her were at the entrance. Mom wasn’t on the balcony and the house was empty. We knew it would be hell. Almost approaching a feeling of mourning or loss. Bitterness and injustice.”\n\nAs to the hugs in court, Suha says she knows that prisoners replay such a moment in their mind for a long time, so she didn’t want to cry and get her mom upset. But she couldn’t help herself. Khalida managed to tell her daughters that she’d heard them on the Radio Palestine program in which people dedicate a song to a prisoner. They told her not to worry: Ajwa, the cat, is fine.\n",

The additional land will be used for the construction of several new ski lifts and service projects. Previously, the land was a government-managed forest preserve area.[6] Bukovel has also plans to build an Olympic winter stadium in preparation for a possible bid.[7] In 2008, the head of the Ukrainian NOC (National Olympic Committee), Serhiy Bubka, announced that even though Bukovel is a world-class ski-resort the talks of hosting the Olympic games are ridiculous as the town does not have the required infrastructure to host such a big event. The deadline for the Olympic bid was October 15, 2009, for which Bukovel was not prepared.\n\nIn the early months of 2010, the administration of Bukovel was involved in the government scandal around the dismissal of the director of the Gorgany Natural Preserve. Vasyl Kisliak was fired by the Minister for protection of the natural environment Filipchuk “for a low level of organizational skills” as the administration of Bukovel could not find a middle ground and cooperation with the director. The cornerstone of the argument became an infrastructural development of the resort and particularly a road that would connect Bukovel with Yaremche.[8]\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine dropped its 2022 Olympic bid for which it was considered a front runner along with Norway due to the War in Donbass.[9]\n\n\nGallery\n\nBukovel SkiResort lift.jpg Ukrainian ski- and spa-resort “Bukovel” 2012 (8).JPG| Bukovel Haski.jpg Ukrainian ski- and spa-resort “Bukovel” 2012 (6).JPG| Snowcat Bukovel.jpg| Ukrainian ski- and spa-resort “Bukovel” 2012 (5).JPG| Ukrainian ski- and spa-resort “Bukovel” 2012 (4).JPG| Ukrainian ski- and spa-resort “Bukovel” 2012 (3).JPG| Ukrainian ski- and spa-resort “Bukovel” 2012 (2).JPG|\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] Privatbank is preparing to sell “Bukovel” (Приватбанк готується до продажу “Буковелю”).

    "passage": "14th Street Line (Washington, D.C.)\n\nThe 14TH STREET LINE, designated ROUTES 52, 54, is a daily bus route operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority between Takoma station of the Red Line of the Washington Metro and L'Enfant Plaza station (52) of the Blue, Yellow, Orange, Green, and Silver lines of the Washington Metro or Metro Center station (54) of the Red, Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines of the Washington Metro. The line operates every 12 minutes during weekday peak hours, 16 minutes during the weekday midday, and 20-30 minutes at all other times. Trips roughly take 40-60 minutes to complete. Select trips begin/end at 14th Street and Colorado Avenue NW as well.\n\n\nBackground\n\n[Route 52 along 14th Street in 2019.] The 14th Street Line is one of the most heavily used routes in the Metrobus system with about 15,000 riders using these buses on a typical weekday.[1] Those routes connect Takoma station to Downtown DC via 14th Street. However, the routes suffer from crowding, delays, traffic, and ineffectiveness due to the routes having at least 26 stops and the frequency of buses is at least 20 minutes. This led to residents opting for the more efficient 16th Street buses (the S1, S2, S4, and S9) prior to 2017.[2]\n\nRoutes 52 and 54 operate daily 24 hours a day between Takoma station and L'Enfant Plaza station or Metro Center station, running along the 14th Street corridor and connecting many neighborhoods to various Metro stations. Route 52 only serves Takoma station during the early mornings and late nights daily, terminating at 14th Street and Colorado Avenue NW during most of the day. Route 54 operates at all times to Takoma station. Additionally, select route 54 trips are operated during school days from 14th & Aspen Streets NW or Reeves Center going northbound.\n\nRoutes 52 and 54 currently operate out of Western division. It originally operated out of Northern division until 2019 when it was closed. At one point, routes 52 and 54 utilized articulated buses, but later stopped using them on a regular basis.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe line was originally operated under the Capital Traction Company which began service in 1895. Congress authorized the Rock Creek Railway to purchase and merge with any connecting company, and to change its name which was implemented on September 21, 1895.[3][4] This merger took place with the Washington and Georgetown on September 21, 1895.[5]\n\nIn 1896, the former Rock Creek line experimented with a new power system on U Street NW between 9th Street NW and 18th Street NW. The Love system transmitted electricity through a set of trolley wheels running on underground conduit rails instead of through the sliding shoe used elsewhere. While the system worked it was more expensive to install. In the spring of 1899 it was replaced with the sliding shoe and the line continued to the Calvert Street Loop.\n\nMeanwhile the branch of the Pennsylvania Avenue Line from the east edge of the White House northeast on New York Avenue and north on 14th Street Northwest to Florida Avenue, part of the original charter, was opened November 15, 1862.[6] A law passed June 30, 1864 allowed it to continue the line north;[7] it was eventually extended to Park Road and later to Colorado Avenue, where it connected to the Washington and Maryland Line.\n\nThe line was originally run by cable cars but was electrified after the powerhouse along 14th street burnt down.[8] The line was later electrified on February 27, 1898. The Pennsylvania Avenue Line and 7th Street Line later followed in 1898.\n\nBy the 1920s, cars were turned at four northern terminals: Park Road, Decatur Street, Colorado Avenue, and Takoma (via the Washington and Maryland Line). Some Park Road cars turned west on Pennsylvania Avenue, while cars from all four terminals turned east. 14th Street was also used by Chevy Chase Line cars to Chevy Chase Lake, which turned off at the U Street Line.[9]\n\nConsolidation\n\nThe North American Company, a transit and utilities holding company began to acquire stock in the Washington Railway in 1922, gaining a controlling interest by 1928. By December 31, 1933, it owned 50.016% of the voting stock. North American tried to purchase Capital Traction, but Capital Traction always remained widely owned by the residents of Washington, without a principal stock holder. North American never owned more than 2.5% of Capital Traction stock.[10]\n\nNonetheless the Great Depression proved difficult for the transit companies and so to survive, on December 1, 1933 Washington Railway, Capital Traction, and Washington Rapid Transit merged to form the Capital Transit Company. Washington Railway continued as a holding company, owning 50% of Capital Transit and 100% of PEPCO, but Capital Traction was later dissolved.[11] For the first time street railways in Washington were under the management of one company.\n\nAfter the 1933 consolidation, the Fourteenth Street Line was combined with part of the ex-Washington Railway and Electric Company Fourth Street Line, which used Fourteenth Street from the White House south to the Bureau of Engraving, where a new underground terminal was built. It later formed routes 50, 52, and 54 which were used the old Fourteenth Street Line, running respectively to the Bureau of Engraving, the ex-WR&E Eleventh Street Line (via U Street), and the Pennsylvania Avenue Line to the Navy Yard. Route 52 was discontinued which ran to U street and 11th Street, but 50 and 54 remained until January 28, 1962.\n\nBus Lines\n\nRoutes 50 and 54 were later acquired to run by buses under DC Transit when streetcars began to phase out. Routes 50 and 54 operated from Takoma and Bureau of Engraving and Printing (50) and Navy Yard (54) primarily running along 14th Street. Route 52 would also be reincarnated to operate a similar pattern to route 52 but altered slightly running via Independence Avenue, 12th Street, and D street. Most trips would end at 14th and Colorado while some trips are extended to Takoma.[12] Routes 50, 52, and 54 eventually became Metrobus routes on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired DC Transit and three other transit agencies.[13]\n\nOther routes that weren't formed under the Metrobus tag were the 56 and 58. Route 56 operated from Summit Hills Apartments to the Bureau of Engraving and route 58 operated to Takoma. Route 56 was later renamed routes 50, 52, and 54 when the merger happened in 1973 while route 58 was later renamed route K8.[14]\n\n1978 Changes\n\nOn February 6, 1978, routes 50, 52, and 54 were rerouted to serve the newly opened Takoma station in order to connect riders to the Washington Metro.[15]\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, route 50 was discontinued, route 52 was shortened to L'Enfant Plaza station, and route 54 was shortened to Federal Triangle. Route 54 was later extended to the L'Enfant Plaza station during the 1990s.\n\nRoute 53\n\nSeveral years after route 50 was eliminated, a new route 53 was introduced to operate along the former route 50 routing between Takoma station and the Bureau of Engraving. It was then later shortened to Federal Triangle and then later shorten to Franklin Square/McPherson Square station.\n\n2015 Proposed Changes\n\nIn 2015, WMATA proposed to cut back the 54 to McPherson Square station due to low ridership south of the station. Service to Archives station and L'Enfant Plaza station would be discontinued. But it was also proposed to improve the frequency of buses between Takoma station and 14th Street and Colorado due to high ridership volume.[16]\n\n2016 Changes\n\nOn June 26, 2016, route 54 was shorten to Federal Triangle with alternative service provided by routes 52 and 53. However, the frequency of buses increased between Takoma station and 14th Street and Colorado.[17][18]\n\n2017 Proposed Changes\n\nIn 2017, WMATA proposed many changes to the 52, 53, and 54.[19]\n\nWMATA proposed to reroute Route 52 to serve the Wharf development via 12th Street, Maine Avenue, and 7th Street SW to and from L'Enfant Plaza station. WMATA also proposed to combine routes 53 and 54 into a new route 54 operating to and from Metro Center station (12th and F Streets NW) shortening route 54 even further. WMATA would also adjust the weekday schedule to coordinate local route 52 and 54 service with a proposed new MetroExtra limited-stop route 59, serve the Wharf, and decrease the time between buses to Takoma station.[20]\n\nThese proposed changes were in order to provide service to the new Wharf development, coordinate schedules with new route 59 limited-stop service, simplify 14th Street service and route designations, alleviate bus congestion at Franklin Square, and responds to requests by the District of Columbia and District Department of Transportation. Performance measures for routes 52, 53, and 54 goes as the following:[21]\n\n  Performance Measure       Routes 52, 53, 54   WMATA Guideline   Pass/Fail\n  ------------------------- ------------------- ----------------- -----------\n  Average Weekday Riders    13,058              432               Pass\n  Cost Recovery             33%                 16.6%             Pass\n  Subsidy per Rider         $1.72               $4.81             Pass\n  Riders per Trip           40                  10.7              Pass\n  Riders per Revenue Mile   7.0                 1.3               Pass\n\nIf the changes are approved, the changes will be implemented as soon as December 2017.[22]\n\nAt the time of the proposals, route 52 and 54 would mainly operate up to 14th Street and Colorado and would only run to Takoma station during select times and Sundays (it would start at Takoma station however). Route 53 would operate between Monday and Saturday only its full route.[23]\n\nOn June 13, 2017, the DC Council and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser approved WMATA's FY2018 budget (a $1.2 million budget) which includes the new limited stop route and reconstructed service along 14th Street. Changes will be implemented as soon as December 2017.[24]\n\n2017 Changes\n\nOn December 17, 2017, route 52 was extended along 12th Street and Maine Avenue SW in order to serve the Wharf development to and from L'Enfant Plaza station with most service along D Street being discontinued. Routes 53 and 54 were combined into one route operating between Takoma station and Metro Center station (F & 12th streets NW) with the 53 designation and service to Federal Triangle being discontinued.[25]\n\nA new route 59 limited-stop route was also introduced to operate alongside routes 52 and 54 between Takoma station and Federal Triangle which replaced the 54 portion between Metro Center and Federal Triangle and fully replaced route 53. Service began on January 8, 2018.[26]\n\n2019 Proposed Changes\n\nIn 2019 during WMATA's FY2021 year, WMATA proposed to replace route 54 and give route 59 daily service. Route 59 will operate every 8 minutes during peak hours and during the same span as route 54 during off peak hours and weekends. However, the route will become a local route between 14th and Colorado and Takoma station serving all stops in between the two points.[27] This was due to the following reasons:[28]\n\n-   To streamline service and simplify the route structure making service easier for customers to understand.\n-   To provide all-day, 7-day-a-week limited-stop service on 14th Street to complement DDOT's planned 14th Street bus priority projects in Columbia Heights.\n-   To maintain frequent service on upper 14th Street north of Colorado Avenue, Aspen Street and Butternut Street, where there is one travel lane in each direction and it is difficult for MetroExtra buses to pass local buses.\n\nAbout 4,800 riders board Route 52 or 54 local service at stops south of 14th Street & Colorado Avenue that are not served by route 59, which would see a 50% reduction in frequency of local service. This is approximately 38% of the total 12,800 riders that board all 52, 54 buses on an average weekday according to WMATA. Approximate frequency at stops south of Colorado Avenue would be as follows:[29]\n\n                             52 Local Only Stops   52 and 59 Local and Limited Service Stops\n  -------------------------- --------------------- -------------------------------------------\n  Weekday Peak Periods       10 minutes            5 minutes\n  Weekday Off-Peak Periods   16 minutes            8 minutes\n  Saturday                   20 minutes            10 minutes\n  Sunday                     30 minutes            15 minutes\n\nIf the proposals were to gone through, routes 52 and 59 would be the only two routes running along the 14th Street Corridor. However, WMATA later backed out the proposals due to customer pushback on April 2, 2020.[30][31][32][33]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] Report of the president ond directors of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad to the stockholders, July 1863, printed in The Miscellaneous Documents of the Senate of the United States for the First Session Thirty-Eighth Congress, Government Printing Office, 1864, document 11\n\n[7] Laws Relating to Street-Railway Franchises in the District of Columbia, published by the Government Printing Office, 1896, pp. 11-15, 47-66\n\n[8] https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200629/http://www.davesrailpix.com/odds/dc/htm/ctc33.htm\n\n[9] Greeters of America, Greeters' Guide to Washington, 1922, pp. 61-63\n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17]  WMATA |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/Metrobus-service-changes-effective-June-26-to-simplify-routes-improve-reliability.cfm |website=www.wmata.com |accessdate=24 May 2020}}\n\n[18]  WMATA |url=https://www.wmata.com/service/status/details/metrobus-changes-june-2016.cfm |website=www.wmata.com |accessdate=24 May 2020}}\n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25]  WMATA |url=https://www.wmata.com/service/status/details/metrobus-service-changes-december17.cfm |website=www.wmata.com |accessdate=24 May 2020}}\n\n[26] \n\n[27]  WMATA |url=https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/budget/ |website=www.wmata.com |accessdate=22 April 2020}}\n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n",

Gathering the things for the day from my car, with my back to the entrance i hear him again.  “yo dom, did you guys work hard yesterday?”  i’m not sure if he is just joking, or whole-heartedly is curious.  sharply, i say “yea man we weed whacked trap bank edges, got sand in my eye and shit, thats probably why you called out yesterday, to avoid the hard work!”  mike explains his wife actually had a bad fall and was bruised and he needed to stay home to help her.  makes me feel like shit for accusing him of calling hookie, so i apologize and brush it off.\n\tStart of the day, i am to mow fairways on the back nine, have my first two fairways done and i am half way through my third.  I see my coworker mike again coming along the cart path, i have to look forward to continue to mowing a straight line but i acknowledge him with a head nod, and out of the corner of my eye, i see he does the same.  I finish mowing the first half of the fairway and start to mow the other half about 10-15 minutes after i first saw mike.  As i go to empty the grass clippings my fairway machine collects, i see mikes cart.  At first i think nothing of it and begin to empty the buckets of grass clippings…  the fairway mower has 5 buckets to empty.  i empty the first bucket, go to put it back in its place and think to myself “that is a curious place to park your cart”  i write it off, “maybe he parked there to stay out of the mud, and walked his mower to where he was working”…. grab and empty the second bucket, “i don’t see him anywhere near this cart and its not exactly the closest spot to where he should be going”  replace the second bucket and start emptying the third “maybe he is just taking a bathroom break, there are some trees near there, thats probably what he is doing”.  third and fourth bucket emptied and replaced… i reach for the 5th bucket “well if he is taking a piss i will be able to see him from here, or he will eventually have to walk back to his cart”  replace the 5th and final bucket and begin to climb onto my machine.  the machine’s seat holds you a good 4 feet off the ground so the perspective from there is much better and i can see that on the back of mike’s cart is the machine he is supposed to be mowing with.  i stand up on my machine to see even further, i don’t see him anywhere near the cart or in the woods peeing, or on his phone by a tree or anything.  i don’t see mike at all, it looks like he just disappeared!  i hope off my mower and start walking towards his cart.  I’m squinting my eyes and scanning the landscape trying to find him.  his cart is parked by a few big rocks at the corner of a hair pin turn.  the top of #14 tee to be exact, and beside the cart is what looks to be those grey stones.  i am walking towards the cart, staring at the stone closest to the cart.  i take a quick paced step once i see the stone looks to be too large to be the stones i know to be placed there.  like seeing lightning strike in front of you, in a flash i realize that is not a stone, an instant passes, and the roaring thunder of realization comes with a fast growing rumble, and an ear shattering and unstoppable crash of understanding.  beside the cart, laying on the ground, is my co-worker mike.  \n\tmy very next step is fully extended and propels me forward, my legs are stretching and throwing my body forward at full speed.  i am running as fast as i possibly can and realizing more with each pounding step, mike is on the ground, why is mike on the ground, i hope he is just stuck or can’t get up, he’s face down.  Oh my god, he is face down!  i send the signal to my legs, FASTER - NOW FUCKERS - MOVE ITTTT!!, they can’t move any quicker, they are at maximum speed, i stretch my legs to increase my gait.  i can’t get to mike quick enough, he is less than 50 feet away and it is taking AGES to get to him.  I’m screaming his name now, screaming and running and i can’t get there fast enough.  finally I’m right over him, immediately i can see the back of his shaved head is purple.  i flip mike over screaming for him to respond, hoping, praying, pleading that i will turn him over and he will be breathing.  when i roll mike over and saw his face it uncontrollably shocked me.  i didn’t have time to be taken back or even react to it, just a momentary pause for the flood of emotions to be processed.  i had smashed through the glass and into chaos, utter despair, pure horror and fear.  Mike’s face was more purple than the back of his head.  his face had been smushed against cold solid mud, it hadn’t stuck to him or gotten into his nose, but his cheek and upper lip looked smushed, his nose too one nostril held closed against the ground.  the impression the ground left on his face did not immediately snap into place.  slowly the skin faded to it’s original resting place, but it was still off.  his face looked distorted, wrong, purple and smushed, his eyes half-open half-closed and completely expressionless.  he was always smiling or showing how he felt right on his face, big cheesing smile, round cheeks and bright eyes behind his glasses.  t didn’t look like him, wasn’t alive like he was, it was flattened and dull, emotionless and frozen. i caught myself honestly questioning if this was even mike.  there was no way to escape the cold hard truth, it was mike, and he was in extremely bad shape.  \n\tbefore i had even seen mikes face, before i even knelt beside him, somewhere along the never ending run i had realized already what was going on and what i had to do.  my brain was making checklists, ordering them for me and coming up with instructions for my consciousness to eventually follow once it had caught up to the realization of what needs to be done.  i had wasted so much time it felt like, i had JUST turned him over, JUST slid next to his side and still i felt like it was forever ago i realized he needs help and what needed to be done was already behind schedule.  fumbling and crying and screaming i paw for my phone.  I’m about to be an emotional mess i think to myself.  another part of me is impatient, and it takes over, i dial 9-1-1 for emergency help for the first time in my life.  press enter, there is no ringing or waiting, at least that i remember, it seemed as if i was instantaneously connected and a woman was asking me “where is the location of your emergency”  i’m flooding her with information, a constant stream of consciousness frantic at first and then steady and continuous flow.  “1800 tournament drive off of 202.  its blue bell country club, but that is the address for the main building, we are out on the course.”  I am talking right over her questions, comprehending them seconds later and without pause answering them in a constant flow of words.  ambulance is on it’s way and i want to start compressions, i’ve already been trying while the 911 operator was getting the information from me.  i ask her to instruct me to give cpr, i have half an idea what i am supposed to be doing and have been doing it and continue to as she describes to me the process.  i am impatient and keep telling her to start counting out when i should be doing compressions, finally she gets to it: “1,2….3,4….5,6…..7,8….”  i can feel his rib break, it’s disturbs me but i’ve heard that is better to have a broken live and be alive.  i have the operator on speakerphone and I’m giving mike chest compressions.  “…hands right between his nipples, pushing with the heel of your palm, use both hands to compress the chest two inches downward.”  we count 100 compressions and check for a response, count to 100, and check for a response.  before the first 100 is complete i can hear sirens coming.  I’m so happy someone is coming and it encourages me.  i look at mikes smushed purple face, nothing moves except when i compress his chest, and it deflates me again.  I wish someone else would do this or i could just stop and cry about it but the part of my that feels that way is not physically in control of my body.  i check his mouth and keep saying his name.  my body is in control of doing compressions, my mind is listening to the operator for cues when to send the signal to my body, and i am staring at mikes face.  I’m feel I’m not even doing the compressions, really I’m not, I’m unable to do that, I’m looking over my own shoulder, crying, sobbing, drumming up and pushing down ebbs and flows of hope and despair, my weaker self incapable of anything but encouraging my mind and body to continue.  i am shattered, in shambles, suddenly I’m sucked back into my own body: desperately trying to make my compressions where they are supposed to be, as deep as they are supposed to be, on perfect timing with the operators instructions, acting with determination and courage.  \n\tit has already dawned on me, and i refused to to swallow it, so i spit it back out.  mike is dead.  i knew it from the second i rolled him over to see the grotesque purple smushed face.  mike is dead and there is nothing i can do, it was too late from even the moment i saw him.  he has laid face down for too long.  i deny it and deny and and still to this moment right now writing this i want nothing more than to believe he will be ok.  i want him to be ok, i beg for him to be ok, i would do backflips and marry this man if he is alive and i will never lose contact with him… but very sadly, very hard to admit, or to say, or to let myself think… out of fear that believing it alone might make it true, or that not acknowledging if he is alive or not may give him advantage.   mike is not ok, mike will not start breathing, mike has died.  i am full.  i have already eaten to my capacity, i am not hungry at all.  in fact the sight of food, even the thought, makes me sick!  and now, laying before me is a full feast for an army.  each bite is force fed to me, spooned in my mouth and forced down my throat.  his purple smushed face, a huge chunk to swallow, i can’t please no more.  i already have a stomach full of my own problems, my own stress, my own emotional turmoil.  one more bite!  forced into me, so much to digest and i don’t want it.  i have enough already.  each spoonful bigger then the last.  i refuse, i won’t even think about it, focus on something else.  time inevitably passes and i forget to keep forgetting what happened.  a thought slips in, the worst are the images, tactile memories, very small, seemingly insignificant details are the biggest pieces, dense and heavy, hard to digest.  i can’t seem to even get them past my mouth, i keep tasting them over and over, just want them to be in, so they can be closer to being let go.  mike was happy all day, literally said “no one can bring me down today”  he was singing all morning, happily accepted what everyone would agree is a hard job, even took the hardest route of that job.  this started out well written and I’ve given up, i just want the words to be here before i devote my mind to forgetting them all.  so sad.  i want to put in here too but i can’t find a segway.  chuck talked to mike when he drove by him, told him he didn’t look good and should take it easy or take a rest,  mike said he was working hard and sweating but it was “good exercise”  i thank all my lucky stars that mike was in a really good mood, and hope that he was at least happy.  i really want nothing more than for mike to be alive.  i can’t help but think that he is dead.  i want him to come back, i hope to everything and anything wether i believe or not, i hope and beg anything, anyone anywhere please let mike live.  let him come back to life and be ok!  \n\nbe happy at all times\nnever stay angry, hold grudges, or talk badly about someone else\ntell everyone that you love exactly how you feel about them\nbe happy at all times, to the best of your ability\nmake friends and strive to keep them\ntell people when they do good\nplease and thank you\ni love you\nbe happy at all times",

    "passage": "[MF] Grum and the 404 Error Page\n\nGrum stared at the 404 error page in shock and horror. The message board had disappeared. The countless hours of work gone, all gone. The images…gone! All the stolen titty pics…gone. The ingenious quips…gone! “Here’s some bigguns. Here’s some more bigguns. Who could complain about these bigguns? Look, some bigguns on Sarah Palin!”(his photoshop masterpiece) He had toiled, nay, labored over every word and thought until it was just right. Each phrase had been born breech, he had dragged them kicking and screaming from the womb of the written word, and shaped, formed and sculpted them into literary gems befitting of a tittie thread. Now they were gone.\n\nThough there would never be anyway for him to prove it, he was quite sure Wilder was behind the malicious attack that had destroyed his labor of love. Right now, this very instant some pimply-faced Chinese teenager, lips orange with Cheetos dust and reeking of Dr. Pepper, via some untraceable Skype link, was sharing a moment of extreme jocularity with that idiot, Wilder.\n\nGrum hit refresh and watched the error page slowly reload. This is madness, he thought, why would someone do such a thing! He hit refresh again, and for a brief moment, he could have sworn he saw an areola flash on the screen. He hit refresh again using all the computer savvy he could muster. Refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh! It was no use; his masterpiece was gone, lost in the dark sewers of unwanted binary. Flushed down the toilet of forgotten ones and zeroes and traveling on toward the eternal abyss of cyber.\n\nHe could start over. He could make it better and bolder, he thought! But nay, it was a fool's errand. He couldn’t put himself through that anguish again. It had been too much. Too much of his heart had gone into that thread, each image and word had been carefully washed with a tear from his soul, it would be impossible to achieve that level of emotion twice in one lifetime.\n\nGrum slowly pushed the the power button on his monitor and cast sullen and saddened eyes on the blank screen. The magic had been there, he had felt it, he had made magic, he had touched the cheek of God.\n\nGrum wept.\n\n***\nGrum’s ear was becoming numb; he had been transferred at least a half a dozen times, and put on hold by each department. He had known going into the phone call, that his chances of success were slim, but hadn’t counted on using up all the minutes on his burner in the effort. It didn’t really matter now; he figured he was past the point of no return, as far as phone calls were concerned. He would see this through. “Google can’t be that fucking big.” He muttered.\n\n“Google archives, how can I help you?” The voice was nasally, but human. Grum congratulated himself for his perseverance and patience.\n\n“I need your help finding a literary masterpiece. A divine work of art, intertwining images of the female form and words, nay, dare I say, lyrics to form the most beautiful tittie thread ever composed by the mortal mind.” Grum sighed and shuddered involuntarily. “I fear that you are my only hope in retrieving this unparalleled collaboration.”\n\n“Yeah, we have doctors and shit here at Google if you need to talk to one of them. You’re not thinking of hurting yourself, are you?”\n\n“No you fool! My tittie thread was deleted, and I need you to find it!” Grum fumed, sometimes the price of always being the smartest person in the room was too costly. “You people have mapped the crevasses of Antarctica; you even have a picture of my car in my driveway on Google Earth. You probably have the first X and zero ever created, framed on a wall in some office there. You people keep everything, and I want it back!”\n\n“Okay, can you give me some meta tags to search for?”\n\n“I didn’t have tags in that thread; I put those in the next one! I embedded a secret code in size tags. 36 D-44DD-40DDD, will those help you?” Grum silently scolded himself, he knew he should have included the tags in the earlier thread, but he had not yet worked out the top secret bra code. “Look for a picture of Palin with big mammarian protuberances, that should narrow it down.”\n\n“Sir, that search took two nano seconds and produced one trillion results on Google Images.”\n\n“I’m not looking for a specific image, you fool, I’m looking for piece of literary brilliance. The meshing of words torn from the very fabric of Homer’s soul, and images of angels adorned with the essence of the breath of life across their bosom.”\n\n“On that search, I’m getting the Iliad, one point seven bajillion results.”\n\nGrum felt his desperation growing at the Herculean task that this was turning into, he cupped the phone with his other hand and whispered. “If you find it, I’ll suck your dick.”\n\n“You think you’re going to be sick, I told you we have doctors on staff here?”\n\n“No you fool, I said, I’ll suck your dick.” Grum hissed.\n\n“If you will hold for a moment, I’ll transfer you.”\n\n“I’ll suck your dick.” Grum said aloud.\n\n“Grum, are you sexting with Tiddle again?” Grum snapped his burner closed and handed the phone to his wife. “This better be the last one, you better not have any more hid in this house!”\n\nGrum wept.\n\n***\n“Ouch!” Grum yelped with a lisp, “Watch the teeth, you made me write L-O-K. Your careless manipulations are making it extremely hard for me to concentrate on my L-O-Ling.” He pouted as he searched for backspace on his well-worn keyboard. Most of the letters were worn off completely, having been replaced with gray and white irregular smudges, all except for backspace; it remained in almost pristine condition, sharp and crisp to the eye. A testament to perfection, if you will. The significance of the undisturbed key was not lost on Grum, ‘details, details the devil’s entrails’.\n\n Though, the condition of the key was entirely unintentional, he had predicted on many occasions that he could pry the little button up and toss it in the trash and never notice its absence. Grum never made mistakes, and the proof was in the backspace pudding. He thought about prying it off still and preserving it in a jar, just in case a museum might want to display it someday. The key in and of itself, probably wouldn’t stand alone, but in addition to a tattered script or screenplay, perhaps a beer bottle and maybe a mouse pad, it might just lend some exhibit a much needed link to his humanity.\n\n“Owie! I mean ouch.” He corrected, removing the lisp this time. It was already the end of February and his New Year’s resolution to butch up was still having a hard time gaining traction. “You are nibbling too hard.” He whined. “Chill, dude.” He corrected again. Change didn’t come easy, and Grum had serious doubts that he would ever rectify his soft wrist.\n\n“You want I should just lick the tip, Boss?” Dog asked from his kneeling position under the desk. “You want I should do that, just lick the tip?” Dog was Glum’s sexual sycophant, a gender confused poet he had found loitering in the halls of higher education at the local junior college. He had taken the young man under his wing and promised the lad literary brilliance and puctuation perfection on page and screen.\n\nGrum looked up, past the ceiling to his brow and stared incredulously for a moment. “Duh.”\n\nDog nodded and busied himself with long puppy dog licks.\n\nThere was something wrong with Glum’s spell-check, though the spelling looked correct, LOL always had the squiggly line beneath it. A virus might be at work, but he wasn’t in any position to address viral issues at that moment. He had more pressing concerns. Wilder could at that very instant, be “righting” some inane drivel that could raise suspicion against him. He reminded himself later, to take a screen cap for his IT guy to peruse. Dog performed dual duties as sexual sycophant and IT guy.\n\nGrum carefully crafted a ‘lots of laughs’ in all caps. His LOLs were works of sarcastic genius, three lettered counter measures designed to confuse and humiliate his internet foes. Grum hit “Submit” on the message board reply box and his tenth, “LOL” zinger of the day was launched into netherweb, a precise, ingeniously fabricated, literary missile was on its way to strike Wilder right in his ass. The idiot wouldn’t know what hit him.\n\nAs the page refreshed, he checked the other five windows he had open for enemy activity. The board appeared to be waking from its slumber, and the view counts were starting to pop. He loaded up a “Quick Reply” with a fresh LOL and gave the open windows another quick, but concentrated perusal, checking for tell-tale signs that Muf F. Diver, the message board's administrator, might be manipulating data and falsifying numbers. He had done so in the past. The thought of Mr. Diver’s, less than honest, behind the scenes actions still made his blood boil.\n\nWilder had three new posts in under five minutes, they caught Grum unawares, if this was any indication of things to come, Wilder would soon be saturating the board with his relentless buffoonery, and Grum would spend the rest of the day playing catch-up. This tomfoolery must be confronted immediately!\n\n Grum pushed Dog’s hungry mouth away from his slobbery member and readied his LOLing finger, just in case things got hairy. “We must put your sexual sycophancy on hold for the moment; we have a fly in the ointment, Dog, a fly in the ointment.”\n\n“Make sure the fly doesn’t get in my butthole, Boss, you want I should get the baby oil instead?”\n\n“This aggression will not stand.” He told the computer screen, ignoring the pup’s whimpering babble. “This aggression will not stand!”\n\n\nBorne Wilder text © 2015 Borne Wilder\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nMore Inane Drivel at: www.bornewilder.com",

    "passage": "The Seekers (comics)\n\n[] _THE SEEKERS_ is a British comic strip drawn by John M. Burns, written by Les Lilley, succeeded by Phillip Douglas and Dick O'Neil. The strip ran from 1966 to 1971 in _The Daily Sketch_.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe main characters, Susanne Dove and Jacob Benedick, are two preferred secret agents employed by Una Frost, director of “The Seekers”, an elite agency of missing persons retrieval. Their investigations frequently lead to adventures connected to the sex industry, exploiting the attractiveness of both detectives, and usually leading to the downfall of sexual predators and oppressors.[1]\n\n\nPublication history\n\n_The Seekers_ began publication on 2 May 1966 in _The Daily Sketch_.[2][3] The concept of the strip bears some resemblance to another strip Burns later drew for a brief period, _Modesty Blaise_. The female characters were consistently drawn in an enticing manner, indicating Burns' evident intent to challenge the limits of the daily British newspaper strip conventions of the times.[4] The initial writer Les Lilley was succeeded by Phillip Douglas starting with episode 14, _The Missing Golfers_, occasionally aided by Dick O'Neil, who wrote one story, _The Curse of the One-Eyed Sailor_.\n\nThe strip ended on 10 May 1971, abandoned due to its lack of lasting success.[5] It enjoyed some popularity in Italy where it was known as _I Segugi_, and the Scandinavian countries, serialised as _Spårhundarna_ in Sweden, _Sporhundene_ in Norway and Denmark, and _Vainukoirat_ in Finland. The name, Seekers, translates as Bloodhounds in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish publications of the strip.\n\n\nStory list\n\n[Exposition panels from the first story, _The Boneyard Club_

Admitted to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on 30 January 1992, with an OSCE office opening in Baku on 16 November 1999,[1] and as a member of INTERPOL, the National police force is well integrated into the law enforcement network of European countries.[2]\n\n\nLaw enforcement agencies\n\nThe Prosecutor’s Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are the main law enforcement agencies, which have broad range of responsibilities.[3] Other law enforcement agencies in Azerbaijan are Customs Committee, Ministry of Taxes, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Emergency Situations, and State Border Service.[4] Internal investigation offices of these agencies are responsible for dealing with crimes in specific areas.[5]\n\nThe Prosecutor’s Office\n\nThe Prosecutor’s office is a part of judicial system in Azerbaijan.[6] In 1999, with the Law “On Prosecutor’s Office” the responsibilities of the office included:[7]\n\n-   investigating criminal acts;\n-   participating in the procedures conducted by the courts;\n-   protecting public accusations in the criminal procedures;\n-   supervising the implementation and operation of laws;\n\nThe Law recognizes the Prosecutor’s Office as a single and centralized body.[8] The Prosecutor’s Office reports to Prosecutor General.[9]\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan is the central executive body.[10] The responsibilities of the ministry include filing criminal investigation, protection of public order and security, and prevention of criminal offences.[11]\n\nThe institutional structure and the regulations of the Ministry was approved on June 30, 2001, by the Presidential decree.[12]\n\nOn November 24, 1992, the Republic of Azerbaijan agreed with the INTERPOL, and the National Central Bureau (NBC) for Azerbaijan was established within the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1993.[13][14]\n\nThe Department of Internal Security was established on June 30, 2004 by the decree of the president of Azerbaijan.[15] The department deals with the activities that are incompatible with police service, exposure of facts about corruption and corrupt officers, and conduction corporate control with the Ministry.[16]\n\nMain Organized Crime Department\n\nFollowing the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan “On Intensified Combat against Crime and Reinforcement of Law and Order”, which was adopted on August 9, 1994, Organized Crime Department was established within the Ministry.[17] On June 30, 2004, the level of Organized Crime Department was upgraded and became main department by the Decree No. 83 “On Institutional Amendments at the Ministry of Internal Affairs”.[18]\n\nIn 2004, the Department on Combating Traffic in Human Beings was established with the Main Organized Crime Department.[19]\n\nResponsibilities of the Department include:[20]\n\n-   fight against robbery, extortion, kidnapping, hostage taking;\n-   fight against human trafficking;\n-   collecting and storing the information regarding organized crime, studying the performance of local police services, data analysis;\n-   exposing, detecting and neutralizing organized criminal groups;\n-   information collecting about criminal groups engaged in transnational crimes;\n-   studying the preconditions regarding to foundation of organized criminal groups and giving draft proposals to the Ministry of Internal Affairs\n\n\nINTERPOL Baku\n\nThe INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NBC) in the Republic of Azerbaijan was established in 1993.[21] The purpose of NBC Baku is to maintain quick and coherent exchange of criminal intelligence between law enforcement agencies in Azerbaijan and their counterparts in other Interpol member countries and work with them to localize fugitives and missing persons and identify criminals by using INTERPOL criminal databases.[22]   \n\nThe departments in INTERPOL Baku are followings:[23]\n\n-   Analysis;\n-   Supplies;\n-   Technical Support;\n-   General Crime;\n-   Registry.\n\nThe number of staffs in INTERPOL Baku is 44 persons and 30 of them are national police officers.[24] The Ministry of Internal Affairs appoints the head of National Central Bureau in Azerbaijan.[25]\n\n\nOrganisation\n\n[Traffic police vehicle in the capital Baku] The National Police force is under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and regulated by the Internal Investigation Department.[26] The latter supervises the police's compliance with law, human rights and civil liberties, and checks for violations of such and any other illegal activities. Directly subordinate to the Ministers, the IID watches over the activities of the police, with a number of divisions dedicated to complaints and organisation difficulties, always as malfeasance matters.[27]\n\nThe police force itself also consists of a large number of divisions and departments, ranging from both specialised and regular police divisions, education, training, medical, a National Central Bureau of Interpol, criminal intelligence, administration, investigation and inquest departments, drug abuse control departments, operations and statistics, transportation, traffic police, human resources, communication and planning departments and press services, financial, logsitcs and civil defence.[28]\n\nLaw enforcement in the contested regions\n\nThe National Police of the Republic of Azerbaijan are also responsible for enforcing the law in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic via a specialised department of Azerbaijan's Ministry of the Interior[29] and the Nakhchivan City Police Department.[30] Responsibility of enforcing the law in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region still officially recognised as being part of Azerbaijan, is split between the Azerbaijan police force and the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army (see Law enforcement in Nagorno-Karabakh).[31]\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Azerbaijan National Police Academy was founded in 1921 in Baku as a training establishment for police officers and commanders, and remained there until 1936 when it was relocated to the village of Mardakan.[32] With the country under the sphere of Soviet influence, 1957 saw the police school was renamed the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs Baku Special Police School, which awarded students law degrees after a two-year course. From 1957 until 1961, the school also trained personnel from Georgia, Daghestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Altay, Irkutsk, Krasnodar, Kibyshev, Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and Saratov.[33] Following support from Heydar Aliyev, then leader of Azerbaijan, the police school became an Academy on May 23, 1992,[34][35] and now resides in Baku, providing training for personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Police Force, as well as offering training programs for foreign organisations on request.\n\nApplicants for full or part-time education in the Academy are given a number of criteria by the police force which must be met before they can be successful. These criteria include physical characteristics (height and fitness) and academic (secondary school graduates, knowledged of literature, history, geography and languages). Successful students who graduate the five-year course are awarded qualifications in law and a promotion to lieutenant in the police force.[36]\n\n\nCrime rates\n\nAzerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs' three-month analysis in 2006 illustrated that Azerbaijan suffers from extensive narcotics-related crime (one crime from every five criminal events is related to narcotics).[37] The MIA's figures state that this drug trafficking across Azerbaijan's borders is a significant problem, and led to the creation of the National Program for Combating Drug Abuse, Illegal Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and Precursors.[38] Azerbaijan is a party to a number of United Nations anti-drug-trafficking conventions from the years of 1961, 1971 and 1988, however the MIA states that it fails to intercept 90% of drugs that cross the border, and recorded 10965 drug-related cases from 2000 to 2004, seizing 747 kg of narcotics, as well as 10,000 tablets and more than 3,000 ampoules of psychotropic substances. 1221 cultivations of illicit substances, and 2000 tons of cannabis were also destroyed in the same period.[39]\n\nDespite the growing drugs problem, from 1993 to 2004 Azerbaijan enjoyed an overall drop from 246 to 185 crimes per 100,000 of the population[40] which is a drop of 18145 to 16810 recorded crimes, and a rise from 79.5% to 94.2% in the number of cases solved. Murders in Azerbaijan decreased from 478 to 201 per 100,000 and thefts from 4943 to 1775 per 100,000. Theft of motor vehicles and firearms crimes also dropped in a similar manner, however robbery increased from 216 to 672 per 100,000 through the period.[41] Azerbaijan experienced a major shooting spree on April 30, 2009, when either one or two gunmen entered the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy, killing 13 and injuring another 13.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe profile page retrieved on May 22, 2007\n\n[3] Law Enforcement Agencies in Azerbaijan. http://transparency.az/alac/files/LAW%20ENFORCEMENT%20AGENCIES.pdf\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7]  Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan|website=genprosecutor.gov.az|access-date=2018-08-21}}\n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] Ministry of Internal Affairs of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic page retrieved on May 23, 2007\n\n[31] Mr David Atkinson, United Kingdom, European Democrat Group, (Rapporteur) The conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference , Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, 29 November 2004\n\n[32] Azerbaijan Police Academy pages retrieved on May 22, 2007\n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] Ministry of Internal Affairs analysis of three months in 2006, retrieved on May 23, 2007\n\n[38] Ministry of the Interior Organizational and practical measures undertaken on narcotics related situation in the Republic of Azerbaija retrieved May 23, 2007\n\n[39] \n\n[40] Ministry of the Interior Comparative Statistics retrieved May 23, 2007\n\n[41] \n",

    "passage": "Transport in Belfast\n\nTransportation systems in the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland include road, air, rail, and sea. It is still a relatively car dependent city[1] however it is also served by a comprehensive rail and bus network. Belfast also ran electric trams prior to 1954.[2] The city has two major airports and the Port of Belfast is the busiest ferry port on the island of Ireland.[3]\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Victorian city of Belfast, transport consisted of horse-drawn carts on cobbled streets.[4] Some of these streets in the Cathedral Quarter are still cobbled. As the city expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, the need grew for public transport to carry workers in and out of the city. The Belfast Street Tramways Company replaced carts with horse-drawn trams and the Cavehill and Whitewell Tramway company ran a steam tramway from the outlying villages of Whitewell and Glengormley into Belfast.[5] Belfast Zoo was created in 1934 from Bellevue Gardens, a playground and pleasure gardens at the end of the Cavehill line.[6] In 1905, the Belfast Corporation took over and electrified the city's tram network.[7] The trams were partially replaced by trolleybuses from 1938, and finally replaced by buses in 1954.[8]\n\nRecent developments have been proposed in the _Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan_, launched by the Minister for Regional Development in November 2004. It aimed to set a new direction for transport in the city following decades of under-investment.[9]\n\n\nCity layout\n\nBelfast remains a divided city. There are 14 neighborhoods in the inner-city of Belfast some of which are divided by peace lines.[10] These walls were erected by the British Army, after August 1969, at the beginning of the Troubles. They were built in an effort to deal with the nightly rioting in the city at the time, and to stop intimidation and population flight. There was very little community consultation throughout this process.[11]\n\nSince the 1970s, the inner city numbers have dropped and the Greater Belfast suburb population has grown. As with many cities, Belfast's inner city is currently characterised by the elderly, students and single young people, while families tend to live on the periphery. Socio-economic areas radiate out from the Central Business District, with a pronounced wedge of affluence extending out the Malone Road to the south.[12] An area of greater deprivation extends to the west of the city. In fact the areas around the Falls and Shankill Roads are the most deprived wards in Northern Ireland.[13]\n\nRoutes\n\nSome important arterial routes into Belfast include:\n\n-   York Street/York Road/Shore Road\n-   Antrim Road\n-   Oldpark Road\n-   Crumlin Road\n-   Shankill Road/Woodvale Road/Ballygomartin Road\n-   Divis Street/Falls Road/Glen Road\n-   Grosvenor Road/Springfield Road\n-   Andersonstown Road/Stewartstown Road\n-   Donegall Road\n-   Lisburn Road\n-   University Road/Malone Road\n-   Ormeau Road\n-   Ravenhill Road\n-   Woodstock Link/Woodstock Road/Cregagh Road\n-   Castlereagh Street/Castlereagh Road\n-   Albertbridge Road\n-   Newtownards Road/Upper Newtownards Road\n-   Holywood Road\n\nWestlink\n\nThe most significant road scheme in Belfast for some years began early in 2006, with the upgrading of two junctions along the Westlink dual carriageway to grade separated standard. The Westlink, a dual carriageway skirting the western edge of the City Centre, connects all three Belfast motorways and has suffered from chronic congestion for some years. The work will cost £103.9 million and is scheduled for completion in 2009.[14] Some commentators have argued that this may simply create a new bottleneck at the at-grade York Street intersection until that too is converted to a fully free-flowing grade separated junction, which in 2007 was expected to take place between 2011 and 2016.[15]\n\nCycling\n\nThe Lagan and Lough Cycle Way, part of the National Cycle Network, runs through the city centre along the Laganside promenade and linking north to Jordanstown through the docks and along the lough shore and south-west to Lisburn along the Lagan towpath.\n\n\nCars and buses\n\n[“Country” bus, Belfast] In the 19th Century due to suburbanization omnibuses became in to use and in 1869 were recorded running hourly on the Malone Road, Lisburn Road, Antrim Road, County Down Road to Sydenham hourly.[16] Belfast is a now a relatively car-dependent city, by European standards, with an extensive road network including the ten lane M2 motorway. A recent survey of how people travel in Northern Ireland showed that people in Belfast made 77% of all journeys by car, 11% by public transport and 6% on foot.[17] It also showed that Belfast has 0.70 cars per household compared to figures of 1.18 in the East and 1.14 in the West of Northern Ireland.[18] [Glider bus rapid transit services opened in 2018.[19]]\n\nMost public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by the subsidiaries of Translink. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by Translink Metro, with services focusing on linking residential districts with the City Centre on twelve quality bus corridors running along main radial roads, resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas. More distant suburbs are served by Ulsterbus. A small number of private operators are also present, including Aircoach who operate a non-stop route from Belfast to Dublin City, via Dublin Airport which competes with services offered by Translink.\n\nBlack taxis are common in the city, operating on a share basis in some areas. Separate associations serving nationalist and unionist areas operate throughout Belfast. During the Troubles, nationalist taxi drivers in West Belfast and Ardoyne became targets for loyalist assassination campaigns.[20] Today black taxis take tourists on tours of the city's sectarian murals. They are now outnumbered by private hire minicabs.\n\n\nAirports\n\nThe city has two airports: The Belfast International Airport offers domestic, European and transatlantic flights and is located north of the city, near Lough Neagh while the George Best Belfast City Airport is closer to the city centre, adjacent to Belfast Lough. In 2005, Belfast International Airport was the 11th busiest commercial airport in the UK, accounting for just over 2% of all UK terminal passengers while the George Best Belfast City Airport was the 16th busiest and had 1% of UK terminal passengers.[21]\n\n-   The Belfast International Airport Aldergrove offers domestic, European and transatlantic flights and is located 21 kilometres northwest of the city, near Lough Neagh. It was opened in 1917 as a training establishment for the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War.[22] A new Executive Aviation Terminal was opened in 1987 and annual passenger numbers reached 4.5 million in 2004.[23] In 2005, it was the 11th busiest commercial airport in the UK, accounting for just over 2% of all UK terminal passengers.[24]\n-   The George Best Belfast City Airport, named after the city's most famous footballing son, is closer to the city centre, beside Belfast Lough. Previously named the _Harbour Airport_, it was opened on 16 March 1938 by Anne Chamberlain, the wife of the British Prime Minister at the time.[25] It opened to passenger flights in 1983 and opened a new passenger terminal in 2001. The airport was officially renamed after George Best on 22 May 2006, the day he would have celebrated his 60th birthday.[26] In 2005, it was the 16th busiest airport in the UK and had 1% of all UK terminal passengers.[27]\n\n\nRailways\n\nBus and rail public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of Translink. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by Translink Metro, with services focusing on linking residential districts with the City Centre on twelve quality bus corridors running along main radial roads, resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas. More distant suburbs are served by Ulsterbus.\n\nNorthern Ireland Railways provides suburban services along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to Carrickfergus and Larne, eastwards towards Bangor and south-westwards towards Lisburn and Portadown. This service is known as the Belfast Suburban Rail system.\n\nNorthern Ireland Railways is the sole public railway operator in Northern Ireland. The network serving Greater Belfast is known as Belfast Suburban Rail and is owned by Translink. These provide rail services along four major routes:\n\n-   Belfast-Larne railway line runs through Belfast's northern suburbs to Carrickfergus and Larne\n-   Belfast-Bangor railway line runs eastwards towards Bangor\n-   Belfast-Newry railway line and south-westwards through Lisburn and Portadown to Newry\n-   Belfast-Derry railway line and north eastern through Antrim and Coleraine to Derry\n\nSome important rail stations in Belfast include Belfast Central, Great Victoria Street, Botanic, City Hospital, Yorkgate. The Enterprise is a cross-border inter-city train service between Dublin Connolly in the Republic of Ireland and Belfast Central in Northern Ireland. It is jointly operated by Iarnród Éireann (IE) and Northern Ireland Railways (NIR).\n\nFerry and Rail\n\nFrom the Port of Belfast ferries connect with Cairnryan with a bus link to Stranraer station on the Glasgow South Western Line to Ayr station and onto Glasgow Central with trains provided by Abellio ScotRail.\n\nProposed transport\n\nIn 2007, a feasibility study was carried out to construct a light rail system in the city, initially along two routes, eventually along four. It had been compared to Luas, the tram system in Dublin.[28][29]\n\nThese proposals included:\n\n-   EWAY – East of city and Dundonald\n-   WWAY – West of city\n-   CITI – Titanic Quarter and George Best Belfast City Airport\n-   SupeRoute – South of City\n\nIn 2008, the Department for Regional Development issued a report suggesting that a “high class bus-based network could cut commuting times while costing significantly less”.[30]\n\nBy 2017, this transpired into The Belfast Rapid Transport System. The new service will be run by Translink and is expected to be operational by September 2018. It is expected that the service will transform the public transport system in Belfast. The route will be served by several new 18-metre Glider vehicles, specifically designed for Belfast, which will feature real time passenger information, destination announcements, CCTV, free Wi-Fi, USB charging facilities and air conditioning. These Glider vehicles are expected to operate every 7–8 minutes throughout the working day. The proposed route will link East Belfast, West Belfast and the Titanic Quarter, via the city centre. The service is expected to help meet the future transport needs of Belfast.[31]\n\n\nSeaport\n\nThe Port of Belfast is the busiest ferry port on the island of Ireland with over 1.2 million passengers annually.[32] Belfast also has a large port, used for exporting and importing goods and for passenger ferry services. Stena Line run regular services to Stranraer in Scotland using their Superfast VII & VIII vessels, with a crossing time of around 2 hours 15 minutes. They also run a passenger/cargo ferry to and from Liverpool using the Stena Lagan or Stena Mersey, with a crossing time of eight hours. There are seasonal sailings to Douglas, Isle of Man that are operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet company (formally SeaCat).\n\n[Harland and Wolff shipyard in 1907]\n\nThe natural inlet of Belfast Lough gives Belfast its own port. As the city developed, this became the major avenue for trade with Britain and later Europe and North America.[33] In the mid-seventeenth century, Belfast exported beef, butter, hides, tallow and corn and it imported coal, cloth, wine, brandy, paper, timber and tobacco.[34] At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Belfast's significant trade made it the richest commercial town in the north of Ireland.[35] Around this time, the linen trade in Northern Ireland blossomed and by the middle of the eighteenth century, one fifth of all the linen exported from Ireland was shipped from Belfast Harbour.[36]\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution arrived, the port provided the outlet for the thriving linen and shipbuilding trades. Belfast harbour was dredged in 1845 to provide deeper berths for larger ships. Donegall Quay was built out into the river as the harbour was developed further and trade flourished.[37] The Harland and Wolff shipbuilding firm was created in 1861 and by the time the Titanic was built in Belfast in 1912, they boasted the largest shipyard in the world.[38]\n\nIt is also the biggest gateway for both the import and export of goods in Northern Ireland, receiving 6,000 vessels, and half a million freight units per year.[39] The _Harbour Estate_ is also Northern Ireland's leading logistics & distribution hub.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] Connolly, S.J.

    "passage": "Unlucky in Love\n\n“What’s wrong with you? Stop calling me, Gwen. Just STOP.” The breakup was a week ago, the text was three hours old, and her response was already percolating.\n\nAn agitated Gwen Lundgren shuffled through design printouts next to her laptop as she waited for a Skype call scheduled for 9:30 Minneapolis time, 3:30 London time. After several seconds, the ruddy, smiling face of Tykon’s International Marketing Director Erick DeMint flittered up on the screen. He was a personable, handsome thirty-something with vibrant hazel eyes and an unruly shock of straw-colored hair. And although she had never seen the entire man from head to toe, that didn’t stop her from fantasizing. There was something different about the background today.\n\n“Gwen? How are you?”\n\nHis accent made her shift positions in her chair. “Erick, I’m great. Happy Friday. Where are you?”\n\n“Took a day off. Can you believe it? So I’m working from home. This is my lovely office. Out that window is my lovely yard where I plan to spend the rest of the afternoon. And later my brother Timothy is coming over for dinner. Oh, and tomorrow morning my wife and I and Samantha are going north to spend the week at a country inn we love near Northampton.”\n\nThe mention of his wife and daughter grated what she hoped was an imperceptible degree of enthusiasm off her voice. “You’re a busy person. Sounds great. How old is Samantha again?”\n\n“Nine, but of course she thinks she’s nineteen. Had the nerve to ask us if she could get her eyebrow pierced the other day. Nine years old.”\n\n“My sister is going through the same thing with her two girls. They both want to be Miley Cyrus when they grow up.”\n\nGenuine laughter. “God, no. Tell her we feel her pain.”\n\n“I’m sure you’re a great father.”\n\n“Oh, I have my days, but thanks. What about your weekend? Taking the boyfriend out on the town?”\n\n“Unfortunately there’s no one special in my life right now. Well, there was, but….I don’t know. Not the luckiest person in the world when it comes to relationships.”\n\n“An attractive young woman like you? That’s hard to believe. Stay positive. You’ll find someone or someone will find you.”\n\n“Thanks. Well, so, should we go over the concepts I sent? You’re making me feel guilty about talking business on your day off.”\n\n“Don’t worry about it. This was on my calendar long before I decided to…” Erick turned in his chair and then turned back. “Sorry. Thought I heard something. Anyway, back to the concepts. Okay. I really liked number three. Nice work. I felt it captured what we were trying to….” He turned again. “There. Did you hear it that time?”\n\n“Sorry. Is anyone home?”\n\n“No. Kara’s at work and Samantha doesn’t get home… I apologize, but let me go check. I’ll just be a second.”\n\n“Not a problem.”\n\nOne of life’s great mysteries was solved as Erick stood up and walked to the office door. He was trim with a very cute butt, just as she had imagined. She could hear his footsteps as he walked through rooms in the house and conjured up an image of him coming out of the bathroom wearing only a small white towel and a tender smile, approaching the bed and…Erick popped back into the room shaking his head.\n\n“It’s an older home,” he said, sitting down. “I know it doesn’t sound very macho, but sometimes I get a little freaked out when I’m here by myself. Okay, where was…I was commenting on design number three and why I was really drawn to this one.”\n\nAlthough her attention was focused on Erick’s face as he talked, Gwen caught a glimpse of a quickly moving shadow cross the window over Erick’s right shoulder. Most likely….obviously a bird, she concluded, and chose not to say anything. She really didn’t want to be distracted from the praise he was lavishing on her design, her abilities to capture just the right tone, how clever she was to distill a complex concept into a few beautiful images. She was wading in his warm words.\n\nThere was a distant clang, as if something metal like a pan had fallen to the hardwood floor. \n\n“I heard it that time,” she said.\n\nErick’s expression became one of concern and he turned around several times. “I…I think someone’s in the house. I can hear footsteps.”\n\n“You’re sure your wife didn’t come home early?”\n\n“Duh. That’s probably it. Like I said, I get a bit spooked here sometimes.” He turned and called out. “Kara? Hey, is that you?” There was a muffled but discernable “Yes,” from another room in the house. Erick’s body relaxed and he smiled nervously. “Sorry about all the drama. I’m just going to see what’s going with my wife and then we can finish up here. Hold on.”\n\nAs much as she enjoyed her conversations with Erick, this was taking longer than she had planned and it was bumping into another meeting that was about to start. Gwen leaned back in her chair and toyed with a pen while waiting. A shadow moved across the hallway beyond the office threshold followed by a murmur of voices and then two loud thumps, which sounded like someone pounding a fist on a countertop. She leaned forward, eyes now zeroing in on the hallway. There was another flitter of a shadow and then a door closed somewhere in the house. This was followed by unnerving silence.\n\n“Erick? Hey, what’s going on? Erick. Are you okay?” Gwen took in a breath and held it. Someone sneezed in a nearby cube and her muscles clenched up as if she’d been stuck with a pin. “Erick?”“No. I’m okay. Everything is fine.” It was Erick’s voice coming from somewhere in the house. “Made a mess I need to clean up.”\n\nShe waited a minute, her heart racing, then called Erick’s name several more times, but there was no response, no movement in the house at all. Do I call 911, she wondered? What’s 911 in London? Maybe he just decided to go…no. He didn’t…he wouldn’t just leave me hanging. Would he?\n\nA passing cube mate made the un-asked for observation that she looked pale and asked if she was okay. Distracted, Gwen nodded and then, part hurt, part still concerned, terminated the call. The screen went dark and there was only her own vague image floating in the blackness of the monitor. An hour passed, then another. Too unnerved to work, she began making inquiries as best she could from another country. She was finally able to track down Erick’s boss at Tykon, who said he’d gone on holiday with his wife, which was actually a plausible explanation after what he’d told her, but still….\n\nThree weeks passed. Gwen emailed and called Erick every day, but received only “out-of-office” replies or was dropped into voicemail. Her time at home was spent checking London newspapers online for any crime that might relate to Erick or his family. She knew that something was not right with Erick’s sudden disappearance, that possibly a crime had been committed, but she had no evidence and could not find anything concrete on which to base her feelings. She called his boss again and was told Erick had taken a brief leave of absence for personal reasons. Personal reasons? Like being dead?\n\nIt was a chilly late fall afternoon as Gwen strode along Nicolette Mall in downtown Minneapolis in the direction of the Dakota when she heard a familiar voice rise above the din of traffic and call out her name.\n\n“Gwen.”\n\nShe spun around and to her astonishment saw Erick walking across the mall in her direction smiling and waving. He was wearing a long black coat with a red scarf around his neck and his hair was shorter, but she knew it was him from the instant their eyes met. Stunned, she stood like a boulder in a river of pedestrians flowing by, her attention fixated on the approaching man.\n\n“Oh, thank God I found you,” he said, putting his arms around her and squeezing tight.\n\nFor a moment, she was too shocked to react, but then quickly wrapped her arms around him and pulled him even closer. “My God, Erick. What the—“ Before she could finish he put his lips to hers and kissed her passionately. She responded without hesitation. Several moments later they separated, and Gwen tried to formulate a coherent question from the dozens that were swirling around in her head.\n\n“What’s going on, Erick? Why are you here? What about Kara?”\n\n“There’s plenty of time to talk about all of that. Right now, however, I would like to take you to my hotel room.”\n\nTwo hours later Gwen sat on the edge of a bed, a sheet draped over her naked body, pleasantly exhausted, but still shell-shocked. The sex had been loud and satisfying, but perhaps lacking a degree of…intimacy. She looked toward the bathroom door where Erick was taking a shower and tried to imagine various scenarios that ended with Erick coming to Minneapolis from England alone to find her after having disappeared for three weeks. None of them made any sense.\n\nWearing only a white towel and a wicked grin, Erick set down on the bed next to Gwen and kissed her cheek.\n\n“That was unbelievable,” he whispered.\n\nGwen blushed, but remained guarded. “Can we talk about what’s going on, Erick?”\n\n“Over dinner. I promise. Let me get dressed and we’ll have a quick drink from the mini bar and then go downstairs. I’ll tell you everything. Promise.” Eyeing him sideways, Gwen got up to dress.\n\nThe bored waiter set their entrees in front of them and walked away without a glance. “Bloody moron isn’t very interested in a tip, is he?” said Erick just a bit too loud. “How’s your martini?”\n\n“Too good. I might have to order another one. So….”\n\n“So. Well, it’s not really all that complicated, although it is rather depressing.” His expression darkened. “That day of the call—“\n\n“The video call?”\n\n“Right, video call, Kara came home early, as you know, and then confessed to me she’d been seeing another man for several months and that she wanted a divorce. That was, of course, a huge shock. I felt like I’d been run over by a tram, but the part of her story that sent me entirely over the edge was that the other man was my brother. The…bitch had been screwing my brother. Well, I was in complete and utter insanity mode. It’s horrible to say, but I wanted to kill them both. Honestly, I had no idea this was going on. Call me stupid or blind or whatever, it came as a total shock. Anyway, I simply couldn’t deal with it and left the house immediately. I’m so sorry, Gwen. I’ve just been in a state of absolute inner turmoil the past few weeks, I can’t even tell you. But then I thought about you and the feelings I had felt whenever we talked and realized it was the perfect opportunity to get out of London for a while and see if my intuitions about you were correct. And it seems they were.”\n\n“Wow. So where’s your daughter?”\n\n“Samantha's with my Mum until I get back..\n\nGwen looked down at her salmon and shook her head not quite sure that all the dots connected, but considering the man of her dreams was sitting across the table from her, she swept her doubts into a dark corner of her mind and looked up, meeting Erick’s piercing eyes. “I’m terribly sorry for everything. It must be a nightmare.”\n\n“It was,” he said. “Until now.”\n\nStaggering and laughing arm in arm down the hallway of her apartment complex, Gwen and Erick made up lyrics to “The First Cut is the Deepest,” which had been playing in the elevator on the way up. “The first cup is the cheapest….” A wobbly Gwen apologized for the mess as she led Erick through her apartment to the living room. She dimmed the lights, poured them both a glass of wine and joined him on the couch, curling up next to him and nuzzling his neck.\n\n“What are you thinking?” she asked.\n\n“That I’m so glad I found you,” he said.\n\nThey talked for another half hour until Gwen heard a familiar ping coming from her bedroom.\n\n“Sorry,” she said, gently brushing the back of her hand across his cheek. “Need to use the bathroom. Would you pour us another glass?”\n\nErick smiled. “I’d like nothing better.”\n\nNot sure why she thought she needed a subterfuge to check her computer, she slipped into the bedroom, sat at her desk and tapped the space bar. The screen quickly brightened and up popped a news alert. She opened the email and scanned several recent headlines from The Telegraph. One caught her eye.\n\nMurdered Family Members Identified\n\nLondon — Scotland Yard was finally able to positively identify the remains of three family\n\nmembers brutally murdered in their Hampstead residence three weeks ago. The victims were 35\n\nyear old Erick DeMint, 34-year old Kara DeMint and their daughter, 9-year old Samantha DeMint.\n\nThe police still have no solid leads…\n\nA shadow enveloped Gwen from behind.\n\n“Don’t turn around.\n\n“Erick? What’s going on?” she asked with a growing sense of alarm.\n\n“Remember several weeks ago during your little teleconference or video call or whatever you call it when I said I had a mess to clean up.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Well, I’m taking care of that now.”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Erick told you he had a brother. What I think he failed to mention was that he has…had an identical twin brother.”\n\nThe razor-edged knife slid effortlessly through Gwen’s neck muscles in a long red arch, releasing a burbling cascade of blood that flowed down her chest like warm red honey. Grasping a handful of her hair, Timothy held her head back until the spasms ended.\n\n“Erick was quite fond of you, Gwen. I’m so sorry, but I’m afraid you had a crush on the wrong man.”\n\n",

    "passage": "[RF] Fox - written from an animal's perspective\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n“Caw!”  The crow screamed from his perch on a nearby tree.  I looked up lazily from the trail I was following.  Beady black eyes stared coldly back at me.  His friends joined in on the cawing, as if taunting me.  It didn’t bother me, though, and I continued on my way with my catch in my mouth.  Stupid birds.  They had nothing useful to say so they just shouted angrily to seem imposing.  Once I was safely back at my home, I packed away the mouse I had caught for dinner and stretched out contentedly.  I would eat it later.  I always felt like getting a little exercise before meals to build up an appetite.  \n\nMy hole was buried deep under a short oak tree.  It was hidden and well protected by exposed roots - an ideal home for a fox.  I poked my head back out of my burrow tentatively, sniffing around.  A new smell had attracted me earlier and I was dying to find its source and I had made up my mind to seek it out today.  Also, lately a lot of new animals had been appearing in our forest and I was really excited to see what new creatures turned up.  The other foxes all laughed at my curiosity.  They said it would lead to my death.  I didn’t see it that way.  The forest had a thousand different ways to kill me at any given moment and I had only made it this far on my own by always knowing my surroundings.  If there were changes to my hunting grounds, whether it be climate, new game, or a new predator, I wanted to be aware of it.  \n\nI sniffed around and started heading back the way I came.  The forest was very lively, which was surprising at this time of day.  The warm summer weather must have proved too tempting for everyone and I found myself in the company of many small woodland animals.  Squirrels were chatting in their trees, a pack of voles was out walking single file, and birds were singing songs on every tree.  I barked loudly a few times to let the animals nearby know it was safe to be around me right now.  It was a rule of the forest that if a carnivore was openly making his presence known, that he was not hunting and meant no harm to other animals nearby.  This law was sacred and I had never seen it broken, at least not in the few mile stretch of land that I stayed in.   \n\nAfter a few meters I caught on to the scent again.  Thrilled, I chased after it at full speed, barking occasionally to let everyone know I meant no harm.  Seeking out new sounds and smells always excited me and on top of that, it was my favorite time of day.  I could see the last glimmer of orange and pink and gold in the sky fading out between the trees to my west.  A strong wind brushed through my fur and I soaked in all the different sensations around me.  All the sights, sounds, and smells hit me and I sighed contentedly.  It was a warm summer night.  This time of day, just as the sky started to darken and the wind began to pick up, was my favorite time to go for a trip through the forest.  Delighted, I let out one powerful, proud bark and charged full speed ahead towards the new smell I was chasing.  \n\nSoon enough, evening turned into night and the sky became a dazzling black and purple ocean full of jewels.  I began doubting that I would reach my destination before it became too dark to see but the smell had grown much stronger and I knew I must be close by so I kept going.  I had never gone this far north before and was worried about getting lost as well.  By now I was able to distinguish two unique scents coming from the same direction.  One was completely new to me but the other seemed familiar, although I could not recall it.  I didn’t think too hard about it because I was too caught up in my own thoughts about the day and everything I had done earlier.  Besides the troublesome crows that had moved into the trees nearby, I had a run-in with some of the black foxes while I was hunting.  I was still absorbed in my thoughts when something caught my attention.\n\n Up ahead I heard a branch snap on the floor and instantly I was on my guard.  The forest is a loud place in general but every once in a while a sound would seem out of place and my gut would tell me something was wrong.  Fear sunk in as I looked around cautiously, trying to identify the cause of the noise.  For a while everything was silent and I became completely still as I crouched down and waited for a potential predator to make its move.  I was very large for a fox but I was still only a slightly more challenging kill than usual for the owls and hawks that would hunt at this time.  Minutes passed and there was absolutely no noise except for the chirping of various bugs.  I started thinking I was being paranoid and decided to move on but every instinct in me warned my body to sit absolutely still.  I willed myself to lift my front paw and take one step forward and, in a split second, the area surrounding me turned into a storm of violent action.  A giant rat came darting straight for me hissing at the top of her lungs.  She wasn’t speaking.  She didn’t want to talk and she wasn’t simply making me aware of her presence.  This was a battle cry.  This was her trying to scare me before she attacked.  Surprised as I was that a rat would charge at a fox, I reacted quickly and lunged straight at her, but another animal reacted much quicker.  I saw a flash of grey light and a powerful gust of wind knocked me off balance.  It took me a moment to collect myself and understand the scene before me.  A great grey owl had appeared seemingly from thin air and was mauling the rat in a flurry of talons and beaks.  I was terrified but also completely mesmerized by this act of extreme savagery.  I backed away slowly to not draw attention but I could not look away from the bizarre sight.  It was over in a few seconds.  Slowly the owl stood up straight with his back to me while still looking at the dead rat near his talons.  Fear crept in and I could not move.  I didn’t want to do anything to attract his attention.  Owls did not eat foxes but they were prone to random acts of violence and never needed a reason to kill.\n\n“You do not need fear me, fox.”  He spoke in a high pitched yet booming voice that did not seem to suit him.  “I was never interested in you to begin with.  Well, not as food, anyways.”  He added.  He sounded pleased.  Hoping this meant I was safe, I cautiously stepped towards the giant owl even though I was so afraid I was shaking.\n\n“Hello.  I am Ragvilus.  You helped me earlier.  I think the rat was going to attack me,” I began, not sure what to say to this owl.  \n\n“Aaah, I found that amusing.”  He laughed, ruffling his feathers happily as he turned to face me.  “Maybe she thought an injured fox would be more appealing to me than a large rat.”\n\n“Would it have been?” I asked.  Despite my best efforts to stay calm my voice quivered noticeably as I spoke.  \n\nThe owl turned his head completely around and hooted.  He stared at me with vertical eyes that looked both completely insane yet infinitely intelligent.  After a few moments he answered with a simple, “Yes.”  Then he slowly began turning back towards his kill.  “Where are you going, Ragvilus the red fox?” he continued as he spread open his wings and revealed his enormous wingspan.  \n\n“Just a few meters north of here.”  I answered truthfully.\n\n“Do you seek the other foxes up ahead?”  He asked.  This caught me off guard.   I had no idea other foxes were nearby. I considered lying to the owl and saying they were my friends to seem like I had a pack with me.  In the end I decided against it because it occurred to me that an owl would not be intimidated by foxes and that if he wanted me dead I would already be dead by now.   \n\n“No.  I noticed a new smell today and wanted to investigate it.”  At this, the owl froze.  He folded his wings completely and turned his head slightly so he could see me from the corner of his eye.\n\n“Strange new animals have been entering our forest.  Isn’t it exciting?”  He asked.  For some reason his voice became very grave.  “But sometimes it does not pay to be so inquisitive.  Red foxes are so very rare.”  His ominous words once again put me on edge.  Without thinking I began backing away but it was unnecessary.  The owl picked up his prey and began lifting himself up into the air.  With two flaps of his enormous wings he was already a few feet in the air.  “Do you know why this area has been especially crowded lately?”  He continued.  I had heard bits and pieces of it but as a predator and an outcast amongst the foxes, I did not have very many chances to find out.  “The cold northern forest was lit completely ablaze.  A fire like this has not been seen in my lifetime or in many lifetimes before.”  By now the owl had disappeared amongst the treetops and his voice began to fade.  “Many new animals.  So very exciting.  But look out young fox.  There are many monsters that lived in the cold northern forests and even monsters fear fire.”  A fire in the north?  I was confused by the ominous threats left by the strange bird.  \n\nShaken up, I turned around and looked at the trail I was following.  Maybe it was time to give up on this.  Maybe this was a sign that my curiosity was finally a bad thing.  I took one more deep breath and thought about what my strange new smells could be.  Then it hit me.  I recognized one of the scents.  It was the smell of smoke and ash.  I have no idea why but a sense of urgency set in at this and my gut told me I had to get to the source of the smell and get there fast.  I had no logical reason to do so but my gut had never steered me wrong before.  I took one last longing look at the trail behind me then sprinted towards the new smell.\n \n",

    "passage": "\"The Curly-Headed One\" (Incomplete)\n\nDr. Edward Rozgut dreamily walked from the back of his office, smiled humbly at his waiting patients, and hinted to Miss Ann, the clinic secretary, to get Ron from his office. Miss Ann slid her slipper-covered feet across the checkered tile floor to a beat-up supply closet door in between the men and women's restrooms. Behind the door was an all concrete room with one lamp in the corner, an unusually short fold-out table, and an upside-down yellow bucket imprinted with “CAUTION” in large black letters. Sitting uneasily atop the bucket was Ron Smith, the clinic's only post-operation monitor. He saw himself as an asset to the clinic. He thought himself irreplaceable, as most working people tend to. As soon as he heard the turning of his doorknob, Ron leapt up, grabbing his latex gloves and POPTM. The POPTM, or Post-Operation Patient Transfer Machine, was merely a glorified mechanized cot but calling it such was blasphemous to Ron, so the clinic staff decided to humor the little goblin man. He jammed the cot past Miss Ann without a word. He stopped in the center of the lobby, nervously looking back and forth between the two operation room doors. Miss Ann, annoyed, pointed towards Room 2A. Ron, defending himself, grumbled, “I know what I’m doing, woman! Don’t rush me!” Miss Ann released a loud sigh and sat herself back at her neatly organized desk.\n\nIt was a bright colored room, void of decoration other than a shakily painted quote above the door stating one of the World Federation’s mottos, “What a Beautiful Waste is Life!” Ron approached the ETB, Ergonomic Tranquility Bed, and stared into the open-eyed, smiling face of the corpse of Walter P. Cavins, age sixty-five. Cavins, like any good citizen of the world, had come to the Tranquility Clinic upon reaching the Age of Service. Cavins was a patriot of the World Federation, a vehement nihilist, and coincidentally, Ron’s cousin on his mother’s side. Ron locked the ETB and the POPTM together, without taking an eye off of Cavins’ face. He watched as the hydraulic lift of the ETB rose, until Cavins’ corpse slid gently into the stationary position on the POPTM. Ron said to Cavins’ remains, “Wipe that smirk off your face, Walter,” before wheeling the corpse down the short hallway to the Organic Recycler, and dumping Cavins in headfirst, all without a single word from anyone else in the building. \nDr. Rozgut kept the same cheery demeanor as he stood and watched Ron's process. With the closing of Ron’s office door, the doctor waved to a young girl and her mother to follow him back to Room 1B. The girl was confined to a wheelchair and her tiny blonde head rested on the neck of a tiny crippled body. Her mother pushed the chair with little effort as the girl hummed a cute lullaby and rocked her head gently back and forth.\n\n\"How are you today, little Miss Abbi Wedgel?\" smiled Dr. Rozgut as he brought his lanky body heavily onto his cushioned stool.\n\n\"Hi!\" blurted the girl. She was mentally handicapped, but she was a gleaming beacon of petty childhood happiness. Her mother, on the other hand, was a stout and stoic woman closing in on the Age of Service. Her face was gentle and constantly rose blushed despite her seriousness, and she tended to keep her puckered, chapped lips together unless directly spoken to. This was much to Dr. Rozgut's dismay as he could never remember whether she was a Betty or Marge. He hated doing anything that he perceived would hurt someone's feelings, so he instead opted to continue his casual conversation with the slow girl.\n\n\"So what brings you and your lovely mother to my clinic today?\"\n\n\"Mommy says...you're a good guy...and you're gunna help me!\" Abbi yelped brokenly. Her mother stared vacantly at the various pictures on the room's drab green walls.\n\n\"Oh, is that so?\" Dr. Rozgut chuckled. \"Wanna know how?\" he asked in the most playful voice he could conjure up.\n\n\"Yessuh,\" the girl slurred. Dr. Rozgut loved to keep things simple, and it overjoyed him that little Abbi Wedgel seemed suited just for the simple.\n\n\"You see, it's such a quick little thing. And it's completely about you, little Abbi. See, your mommy will take you out for the best day ever, see?\" he pointed toward a colorful poster depicting ice cream, smiley faces, and lollipops. \"Then you'll come back here and I'll give you a little something to make you sleepy, see? Your mommy and I will be with you the whole time. See, after your little nap, you'll wake up, see, and be up there,\" he pointed again, this time towards the speckled ceiling and bright fluorescent lights, \"in heaven. See?\"\n\nThe girl twirled her short blonde hair and gazed up at the lights with her light blue eyes. \"Can I be an angel?\" her smile doubled in size.\n\n\"Why, you're already an angel, little Miss Abbi Wedgel!\"\n______________________________________________________________________________\nDr. Rozgut took Abbi out of Room 1B back to the lobby. “Miss Ann,” he smiled, “you wouldn’t mind keeping our little friend company while her mother and I have a short conversation, would you?”\n\t\n“Of course not,” Miss Ann beamed. She snatched the opportunity to have someone else to talk to other than Ron Smith, whom she aggressively and actively despised. Dr. Rozgut quietly closed the door behind him and attempted to lock eyes with Ms. Wedgel. He noticed something unsettling about her. Her eyes fidgeted around the room, trying desperately to cling to anything but Dr. Rozgut’s kind, deep-blue eyes. This disturbed Edward. Every visitor to the clinic took an instant liking to Edward. He had a trustworthy air about him and the tender, friendly features of a much younger man. He took pride in very few aspects of his life, but it had always satisfied him to know that he was trusted among his neighbors, even those that had never spoken with him directly.\n\t\n“Ms. Wedgel, I…” he trailed off, and began to sweat from nervousness. Ms. Wedgel forced out words before Dr. Rozgut could compose himself.\n\n“I know what I’m doing,” she choked. “I know that I’m giving her a death sentence.” She burst violently into tears. “What kind of mother kills her only daughter?”\n\n“There’s no pain involved, if that’s what worries you,” Dr. Rozgut whimpered meekly. He had never encountered such sudden guilt, such anguish. Death was an essential part of society. Euthanasia had become a tenet of the Nihilist-Socialist doctrine long before Edward’s time, long before any living person’s time. Edward certainly didn't fear death. He would enjoy his life, reap the benefits of the World Federation while he could, and at the Age of Service, he would, like all other patriots, voluntarily end his own life for the common good. That was the way it was. That was the way it should be, he thought. How could society prosper as it did if the population wasn’t regulated?\n\n“Pain? You think I’m worried about her pain?” she gave a sick sort of laugh. “She’s been in pain her entire life! I brought her into this world broken and twisted! It’s not the pain that bothers me, sir, it’s the principle!” \n\nHer sudden wretched episode nauseated Dr. Rozgut. He could feel the contents of his stomach edging up his esophagus; his heart beat more and more rapidly after every passing second. “Principle?” he stammered. “But, Ms. Wedgel…”\n\n“It’s Betty, dammit! Betty!” she screeched between tears.\n\n“Sorry, Ms. Wedgel, I mean Betty. Look, you know as well as I that this is voluntary. No one can be forced to do this; you don’t have to euthanize Abbi. It’s against the Ethics. It’s all voluntary. It’s a service to society.”\n\n“A service? Voluntary? Ethics?” she raged hysterically. “You don’t know the meaning of…” She stopped. Her eyes finally met Edward’s. He was visibly disturbed, confused terror filled his face. Ms. Wedgel wrested control of herself. Apathetically, she responded. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, doctor, I have to go. I’ll be back later in the week. I’ll bring dear little Abbi.” She stormed out of Room 1, slamming the door behind her unintentionally in her rush. Edward sat alone on his cushioned stool and put his face to his hands.\n\n“Alright, okay,” he whispered. He ran his bony fingers through his coarse hair and stood. Miss Ann cracked the door open, and through the small space called to Dr. Rozgut.\n\n“Edward? Ms. Wedgel just ran out of the office. Is everything alright?”\n\n“I’m not sure,” Edward stood completely still.\n\n“Do you mind if I come in? Edward?”\n\n“No, no, don’t come in,” he said in a low, sad voice. “Tell Ron to go home. Close up the clinic. You can go home, too.”\n\n“Are you sure? Old Mr. Johnson called; he said he was finally ready to come in today, though.”\n\n“Tell old Mr. Johnson we can do it another day. Any other day will do.”\n\n“But…”\n\n“Miss Ann, I’m sorry, but I’m done for the day. I’m going home as soon as all of you are out of the clinic. Maybe it’s not the best day to be providing our Service.”\nEdward listened with his ear to the door waiting for everyone to leave. Miss Ann was knocking at Ron’s door.\n\n“What the hell do you want, woman?” Ron started to yell. “I know for a fact there ain’t more goddamn patients out there!”\n\n“Ron,” Miss Ann tried to keep calm, “Edward said we could go home.”\n\n“Why the fuck would he say that? He didn’t say nothing to me!” His door flung open, bashing against the wall, narrowly missing Miss Ann.\n\n“Ron, listen. Listen for once. Get out right now. Get the hell out of the clinic. Edward’s done, so we’re done. Okay? Is that okay with you, Ron?” she snapped.\n\n“Fine, woman! See if I come back!”\n\n“Nobody gives a shit Ron, all you do is roll around cots all day!”\n\nThe fighting became more distant, and the bell above the door chimed. Edward finally left Room 1B, grabbed his things, and began his walk to the Commune’s living quarters.",

    "passage": "[]\nA lot of people have problems working with and understanding what asynchronous code means. This article is an intro into the basic asynchronous Python, where I'll try answering the question why or how the async makes your code to go fast.\n\nLet's start with the simplest definition. ASYNC is a style of concurrent programming. It's the most generic term that means doing many things at once.\n\n\nHow Does Python Do Multiple Things At Once?\n\n\n1. Multiple Processes\n\nThe most obvious way is to use MULTIPLE PROCESSES. From the terminal you can start your script two, three, four…ten times and then all the scripts are going to run independently or at the same time. The operating system that's underneath will take care of sharing your CPU resources among all those instances.\n\nUsing CPython that's actually the only way you can get to use more than one CPU at the same time.\n\n\n2. Multiple Threads\n\nThe next way to run multiple things at once is to use threads.\n\nA THREAD is a line of execution, pretty much like a process, but you can have multiple threads in the context of one process and they all share access to common resources. But because of this it's difficult to write a threading code. And again, the operating system is doing all the heavy lifting on sharing the CPU, but the global interpreter lock (GIL) allows only one thread to run Python code at a given time even when you have multiple threads running code. So, In CPython, the GIL prevents multi core concurrency. Basically, you’re running in a single core even though you may have two or four or more.\n\n\n3. Asynchronous Programming\n\nThe third way is an ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING, where the OS is not participating. As far as OS is concerned you're going to have ONE PROCESS and there's going to be a SINGLE THREAD within that process, but you'll be able to do multiple things at once. So, what's the trick?\n\nAs an example we can take a chess exhibition where one of the best chess players competes against a lot of people. And if there are 24 games with 24 people to play with and the chess master plays with all of them synchronically, it'll take at least 12 hours (taking into account that the average game takes 30 moves, the chess master thinks for 5 seconds to come up with a move and the opponent - for approximately 55 seconds). But using the asynchronous mode gives chess master the opportunity to make a move and leave the opponent thinking while going to the next one and making a move there. This way a move on all 24 games can be done in 2 minutes and all of them can be won in just one hour.\n\nSo, this is what's meant when people talk about asynchronous being really fast. It's this kind of fast. Chess master doesn't play chess faster, the time is just more optimized and it's not get wasted on waiting around. This is how it works.\n\nIn this analogy the chess master will be our CPU and the idea is that we wanna make sure that the CPU doesn't wait or waits the least amount of time possible. It's about always finding something to do.\n\nA practical definition of ASYNC is that it's a style of concurrent programming in which tasks release the CPU during waiting periods, so that other tasks can use it.\n\n\nHow is Async Implemented?\n\nYou probably want to know a little bit more. How can you do that with one process and one thread? You need two things, basically.\n\nThe FIRST THING that you need is to have a function that can SUSPEND AND RESUME. A function that enters a waiting period is suspended, and only resumed when the wait is over. There are four ways in which you can do this in Python without OS help. Those ways are:\n\n- the callback functions, but they are pretty gross, so no examples will be provided,\n\n- the generator functions - a Python feature that have been there for a long time,\n\n- async/await - the keywords that you can use in Python 3.5+,\n\n- and the third-party package called greenlet - that actually implement this as a C extension Python which you can install with pip. But in this article we aren't gonna get into them.\n\nThe NEXT THING that we need is a piece of code that can decide how the CPU is shared, which function gets the CPU next. So, we need a scheduler of sorts. And in asynchronous programming this is called an EVENT LOOP.\n\n\nScheduling Asynchronous Tasks\n\nAn event loop will know all the tasks that are running or want to run, it'll select one and give control to it. That task is going to suspend when it needs to wait for something. The control will go back to the loop and the last will find another task and it'll keep going that way. This is called COOPERATIVE MULTI-TASKING.\n\nThis is a super simple test. Let's say that we wanna write a little script that prints 'hello' waits 3 seconds and then prints 'world'.\n\nExample: Standard (synchronous) Python\n     from time import sleep\n\n    def hello():\n        print('Hello')\n        sleep(3)\n        print('World!')\n\n    if _name_ == '_main_':\n        hello()\n\nIf we were to put a loop on that 'hello' on the bottom to run 'hello' 10 times, for example, this is gonna run not for 3 seconds but for 30 seconds.\n\n\nExamples: Asyncio\n\n    import asyncio\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n\n    @asyncio.coroutine\n    def hello():\n        print('Hello')\n        yield from asyncio.sleep(3)\n        print('World!')\n\n    if _name_ == '_main_':\n        loop.run_until_complete(hello())\n\nIn the first example we're using a GENERATOR FUNCTION. Generators are these special functions that typically you use in Python to generate sequences of items. The nice thing about them is that you don't have to pre-generate all the entire sequence you can generate elements of that sequence as the person calling the generator asks. You can repurpose that using yield or yield from keywords and also use it for an asynchronous function. Basically, when we reach the yield from in the example above, we are saying: \"OK, loop, I'm done for now, so I give you back control. Please, run this function for me [the one that follows the yield from], so asyncio sleep for 3 seconds. And when that's done I'm ready to continue\". The loop will take note of that and then manage everything. Because it’s a scheduler and that's what it does. So, if you were to call this 'hello' function 10 times instead of running for 30 seconds you're gonna see 10 hellos then a pause for 3 seconds and then you’re gonna see 10 'worlds'.\n\n    import asyncio\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n\n    async def hello():\n        print('Hello')\n        await asyncio.sleep(3)\n        print('World!')\n\n    if _name_ == '_main_':\n        loop.run_until_complete(hello())\n\nIn the second example you can see an improvement that you get in recent Pythons - a much nicer syntax. Functionally these two are equivalent. You have an  async def declaration, that's what you use to define an ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTION. And if you use that syntax to declare the function then you get to use await for the suspension and resuming.\n\nThe one of the things that asyncio is great for is that it makes very explicit the points where the code suspends and resumes.\n\n\nAsync Pitfalls\n\n\n1. What happens if you have an asynchronous program with one or more tasks that need to do some heavy CPU calculation?\n\nSo, the problem is if you use the CPU in your function for, say, one minute then during that minute nothing else will happen, because this's a single thread. All tasks need to be nice to the remaining tasks and release the CPU often. You have to call 'sleep' every once in a while in a function as often as you can. But if you're really greedy and you don’t want to give up the time that you've got the best you can do is you can sleep for zero seconds. This is basically saying the loop that you need control back as soon as possible. If your calculation has a loop, which is pretty common, then you stick a 'sleep 0' inside that loop. This way once per iteration you allow other tasks to continue running.\n\nExample: await asyncio.sleep(0)\n\n\n2. The second problem is that the blocking library functions are incompatible with async frameworks.\n\nSo, there's a bunch of things in Python Standard library that are assigned as blocking functions: socket.*, select.*, subprocess.*, os.waitpid, threading.*, multiprocessing.*, time.sleep. Everything that has to do with networking, processes, threads, you cannot use them. This is true for every async framework. If you use these functions the thing is gonna hang. So, don't use them. It's very unfortunate.\n\nAll async frameworks provide replacements for these functions. And sometimes it’s kind of sucks, because you have to learn a different way to do the things that you know how to do. All these common things that you do with processes, threads and networking. Unfortunate, but true. It's true for Asyncio, Eventlet, Gevent, Twisted, Curio, all of them. They all provide alternative ways to do these blocking things.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nLet's summarise this with a little table that compares processes, threads and async on a number of categories.\n\n\nProcesses vs. Threads vs. Async\n\n                                       Processes          Threads             Async\n  ------------------------------------ ------------------ ------------------- -------------------\n  Optimize waiting periods             Yes (preemptive)   Yes (preemptive)    Yes (cooperative)\n  Use all CPU cores                    Yes                No                  No\n  Scalability                          Low (ones/tens)    Medium (hundreds)   High (thousands+)\n  Use blocking std library functions   Yes                Yes                 No\n  GIL interference                     No                 Some                No\n\nYou might think that these are super cool non-blocking doing something while a task waits exclusive to async and that is not true. Processes and thread can do that pretty well too. And it's actually not Python doing it, in that case it's an operating system doing it. So, there's no winner here.\n\nThere is a slight difference there - in the processes and threads case it's the OS doing it, and in the async case you have your async framework (asyncio, gevent and so on) that doing it. That's cooperative for async and preemptive (which is called when the OS yanks the CPU out without you knowing it) for processes and threads.\n\nIf you want to maximize your multiple cores in your computer then the only way is processes. And many times people combine processes with one of the other two. They run a multi thread on an async program and then they run it as many times as cores they have.\n\nScalability is an interesting one, because if you're running multiple processes each process will have a copy of the Python interpreter and all the resources that it uses plus a copy of your code, your application, plus all the resources that you use, so all of that is gonna be duplicated. If you start going crazy and start new instances you’re gonna find that pretty soon you're probably gonna be out of memory. You cannot run a lot of Python processes on a normal computer. So, the scalability is pretty low with processes, in the ones or the tens but no more than that. If you go to threads, they are a little bit more lightweight than processes, so you can initiate much more threads than processes. This way you can scale a little bit better, say, in the hundreds. If you go with async, there everything is done in Python space, there are no resources at the OS level that are used, so these are extremely lightweight. This is a clear winner. Async can go into thousands or tens of thousands even. So, this can be a good reason to go async.\n\nNow we have the bad news of using the blocking functions in the Python Standard library which processes and threads can do no problem because the OS knows how to deal with those. But when we lose the support of the OS in async we cannot use those functions and we need replacements. And the last is the Global Interpreter Lock. It causes some troubles with threads, but it’s not that bad when you have the types of applications that are good for also the async which are heavily io. Because if you have threads that are blocked on io then you don't hold the GIL. So, if a thread goes to wait then the OS will be able to give access to another thread without any problems.\n\nSo, really, it's not that great. There arenэt that many things that are better for async. Basically, the best argument to go async is when you really need massive scaling. These would be servers that are going to be very busy. Async can go into thousands or tens of thousands of connections and it's like nothing, not a problem. In any other category it's not really clear that you should go async unless you like it.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nThe article was inspired by the Miguel Grinberg's talk on the PyCon 2017.\n",

    "passage": "[RF] Ambition\n\n “There are 7 billion of us out there, 7 billion lives, all existing simultaneously. Out there, at this very moment, everything is happening. Someone’s’ falling in love right now, and someone’s’ falling out of it. A child is watching his dad beat his mum while hiding in a cupboard and someone is killing someone else for the very first time.” \nI stopped, taking another drag from the poorly rolled joint. I looked more like a sagging cigarette now. \n“The sheer number of people on this earth means that statistically whatever you’re going through, whatever shits troubling you, someone’s’ gone through it before. I guess it’s comforting in a way, but it also sort of makes you realize how unimportant you are.” \nJonas looked up and chuckled.\n“Frederick, you need to lay off the dope man. You’re sounding like my mum”\n The sun was beginning to set and the last of the light was casting purple and pink splotches across the horizon. I could see some birds in the distance, looked like shorebirds, probably migrating North to Siberia. I slid down the graffiti covered skate ramp and stubbed out the joint on the cement. “C’mon, we’re going to be late.”\n\nThe main street of Port Fairy, Victoria was as silent as the deaf school that they built in the southern part of town. That was, of course, apart from the times the folk music festival was here. But other than that, Jonas and I usually had the streets to ourselves. On Fridays’, our parents would meet up for trivia at the local tavern, always stumbling home, drunk on beer and cover bands, at some absurd time of night before laughing their way to bed. Us kids would generally head down to the beach for some bonfire party. It was there we would all drink and smoke till we passed out on the sand. It was like some kind of sick competition as to who could get fucked up the most. As we got closer to the end of school though, the kids would spend less time drinking and more time talking about getting out of here, going to the city, travelling the world and shit like that. My English teacher wanted me to have those dreams, said he saw big things for me. Always going on about some degree at a fancy Melbourne university. To be honest though, I’d be happy just to work on the docks with dad. I put my hands in my pockets and felt the crumpled Melbourne Uni pamphlet I picked up earlier. I pulled it out and threw it into the trash before light-heartedly shoving Jonas. \n“Try not to piss yourself this time will you mate.” \nHe scowled \n“Fuck off dickhead, it wasn’t piss, I spilled my drink.” I bowed my head to hide my smile as we walked towards the beach.\n\n“You think Abigail will be there tonight.” \nAbigail was Jonas’ Bella. Y’know, Bella, from the 2 excruciating hours that is “Twilight.” Except Jonas didn’t half the charm of Edward, never mind the looks. If he did then perhaps he’d have a chance. But he’s still obsessed, whether it’s a possibility or not. You see, Abigail had moved next door to him when he was 6 and he hasn’t shut up about her since. “\nYeah, she’ll be there, Jocks’ going and she fancies him I reckon.” \nJonas’ expression suddenly turned inwards and his bubbliness instantly went flat. I don’t know why I said that to him, yeah it was true, but I could’ve let him stay in denial. I guess I was just tired of him spending these nights chasing her and leaving me alone by the fire. Trying to get rid of the guilt building slowly inside of me I quickly added, \n“But you guys are meant to be together... So she’ll come round I reckon.” \n“You really think so?” \nHe looked up, so committed to the idea of a relationship with her that he would believe anything that promoted its’ cause. \n“Yeah mate, I know it. Look there it is, I can see the bonfire.” \nI pointed towards the glimmer of light coming from the beach. It was almost dark now and a cool sea breeze carried the smell of salty water. The ambience of it almost overcame me. Regardless of what the other kids thought, for me, this was my home.\n\nThe fire flickered and danced as I stood in the warmth emerging from its’ tender fingers. Jonas had gone off to chase Abigail and I was left alone by the fire. Now onto my 6th beer I was definitely feeling the alcohol, finding it difficult to remain focused on one thing. The whole party had long ago turned into a crude display of lust. Everyone had paired up in a desperate attempt to escape the loneliness and deep-seated insecurities that came with being an adolescent in a country town. The lucky ones who had found someone had gone off and now only a spare few remained, some face down in the sand and others just sitting, staring into the waves. As I was considering whether to join the sand people, someone tripped behind me. I turned around to see who the latest victim of alcohol poisoning was and it surprised me to find Jonas. He looked up, wildly distressed with sand all over his face. He didn’t seem too intoxicated but his hands were shaking real bad and he looked pale. My only thought was that he probably took too much of the E he had brought along. \n“Big night buddy?” \nI asked cynically, smiling to myself. He shook his head quite violently.\n “Nah, nah, Frederick, it’s not that. Something’s happened…” \nHe paused \n“Something bad has happened man, something real bad man, real, real fucked up, and I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean for this to happen, I promise. I didn't mean it to go like this” \nHis pupils were dilated and his eyes kept darting from left to right. His thick eyebrows were creased and his messy red hair was tangled. He looked like a right madman. I laughed.\n“Yeah, good one mate. Real funny.” \nAlthough I wasn’t in the mood for practical jokes I’d give him this one, his acting was actually pretty good. I waited for him to reveal the prank but he just kept darting his eyes, rubbing his hands together and looking around nervously. \n“Real funny Jonas. Now stop it, I’ve had a rough night. I’m going to sleep.” Yet, as I turned to go, he kept shaking his head, and now, looking at him, his expression was one I hadn’t seen on him before. Pure terror. I stopped. Maybe this wasn’t a joke \n“Shit mate…” \nIt was apparent now that he was dead serious. \n“What’s going on?”\n\n“What the fuck did you do Jonas?” \nHe didn’t respond. He was caught up in whatever fucked up mess was going down inside his head. Running over the dunes, every few strides he would stumble then continue with the same hurried angst. I followed close behind him, wondering what could’ve happened to make him like this. Jonas was generally a pretty chilled person so to see him all riled up like this was a bit of a shock. We were getting pretty far away now and the light of the bonfire was growing dim. I pressed my red denim shirt to my body, feeling the cold. My skin was turning slightly pinkish; it always reacted weirdly when the weather got this way. Jonas finally stopped on a tall sand dune. From the bottom of it, he looked sort of like a hero from the novels my mum used to read to me as a kid. Bare feet, wind blowing in his hair, with the moon and the stars above him, he looked like nothing could ever bring him down. I slowly trudged up next to him. Standing there, we must have looked like two giants in the night. The kings of the beach. I kept looking forward, trying to see what was so important he had to bring me all the way out here. Then I looked down, fuck, I shouldn’t have looked down.\n\nI’d always imagined a dead body would be blue. Y’know, blue, bloody, the shit you see in horror movies. But in reality, they just look like a normal person, like they were sleeping just… missing something. There was one thing the movies got right though, his body was cold. As I shuffled the woollen jumper up to see if he had a pulse I was shocked by his iciness. Jonas was still shaking, stricken with paranoia his eyes were still dating rapidly from side to side, scanning the dunes for anyone who might bear witness to his act of sin. \n“One minute he’s dancing with me, laughing and having a good time and then he’s face down in the sand.” \nHe stuttered then coughed quickly to correct himself \n“I was out here just, just angry, about Abigail and stuff, so I decided to pop a couple of caps, I got them off my brother. Just a few caps y'know. Anyway he was out here, looked a little lonely, like me, so I asked if he wanted one. I didn’t do anything to him Frederick, you know that right, you believe me... you believe me right? I just gave him some E, that’s all. Just some E.” \nIt was only after the initial shock faded that I became aware of the repugnant smell. I gagged into my shirt. I’d heard that humans defecated upon death due to the loosening of the bowel muscles. Just thought it was another urban legend, to freak us out. Never thought it was true, not until today. \n“I think he’s dead Frederick, I think he’s fucking dead.” \nJonas began to cry, in small bursts at first, but then full-blown sobbing. I had never seen him cry at all, not before tonight. \n“Shut up Jonas. Someone’ll hear you.” \nHe scrunched his t-shirt and put it in his mouth. I stopped, breathing deeply. I had no idea what to do but I couldn’t expect any rational thinking from Jonas so it was sadly on me. I had to deal with the dead guy lying cold in the sand. What the fuck happened to a relaxing bonfire. I checked one more time for witnesses before turning to Jonas, hiding my terror behind a mask of solemn determination. \n“Now, Jonas, I need you to listen to me, did anyone else see him? Anyone at all.”\n\nI rolled the body onto its’ front and gagged again. It was Chris. Chris from the private school in the rich part of town. Chris from the football team. Chris who sang in choir. Chris the kid who never was that bright, who was one of those 6-foot tall weightlifters who laughed whenever one of his mates would let rip in the car. Chris who was simple. Chris who never wanted to go to Uni either. Had a construction job lined up he reckoned, with a cousin over in Warrnambool. Of course, none of that mattered now. Now he’d never even get to turn 18. Never have kids. Never get married. Never get to see his mum smiling when she realised her little boy was all grown up. Tragic.\n\nSnapping myself out of lamentation I realised the sun would be up soon. We needed to be quick if we were going to remain unseen. Fact of the matter was, Jonas had given him the E. Didn’t matter he didn’t kill him himself. Everyone knew Jonas was the only one with E and it was the E that caused Chris to end up dead. I had to think of Jonas now. Chris was gone, couldn’t do nothing for him and going to the pigs would just put my mate behind bars. I turned to Jonas, who was still crying, \n“We’re going to have to move him.”\n\nFireman carrying Chris towards the water reminded me of when my dad used to carry me inside after the long car trips back from Melbourne. Funny how the roles reverse so suddenly. I buckled numerous times under Chris’s’ weight as Jonas walked behind me. Although I was the one carrying the body, Jonas was carrying a hell of a lot more, metaphorically of course. As we grew close to the shore I laid Chris with down in the sand, head first. It was easier that way, didn’t have to see his face. \n“Frederick” \nJonas stuttered, wiping away snot and tears on his sleeve.\n “What are you going to do?” \nI lifted Chris up underneath his shoulders then turned to Jonas. \n“He was drunk, he went swimming and he was drunk. A rip carried him out. Do you understand?” \nHe nodded and then began sobbing again, black circles now forming under his eyes. \n“Grab his feet.” \nI instructed him sternly while repeating to myself, solemn, stay solemn and distanced, Jonas needs you, he needs this. As we waded out to sea, the water became colder. Without the sun shining against it, it looked as black as the night sky. The foam from the waves broke against our ankles. The Ocean, at this time of night, resembled a moving breathing body, silent and dark. I watched the patterns forming from the breaking of the waves, the break making subtle shapes on the water top. At about chest height, shivering profusely, I looked to Jonas and nodded. He understood. The look in his eyes said enough. After letting go of Chris’s’ feet he looked away, as if by not facing the same direction as the body it would nullify what he had done. Before I let Chris go, I grasped his fingers, feeling the coarseness that had developed from the delivery work he did with his family in the summer. In the dark I could only see the faint outline of his body sinking downwards. The current would take care of the rest. Carry him away from us and away from our quiet country town.\n\nDespite the fact my clothes were soaked and my knees were shaking I became aware of the fact that I could no longer feel the cold. Sitting down next to Jonas I looked out at the ocean, moving methodically, forward then backwards, taking and depositing sand as it came and left. Jonas and I just sat there. Sat there till the sun came up, gripping each other tightly and watching as the new day arrived, knowing nothing of the events of last night. Once again, the light painted the horizon with brilliant colours, but in our distress we were no longer witness to the beauty of the sun.\n\nAmbition, ambition, ambition. They never shut up about it, you get one good mark or read some intellectual book and all of a sudden you have to go to bloody Cambridge. I think I may move to the city after all though. Nothing but bad memories in this town I have to walk past the memorial for Chris every day. His family still drops off flowers like once a month, I see his mum crying sometimes, close to the school. Jonas and I don’t talk much anymore, guess after what happened we just want to forget. Some nights, when things get real bad, I find myself wishing I were like the shorebirds, just able to fly off anywhere, with the cool breeze in my hair and the smell of salt water encasing me.\n",

    "passage": "On Tuesday, NASA announced that it completed its first full-power test of the Kilopower reactor, an experimental portable nuclear power plant that the agency hopes will one day power permanent settlements on Mars and the Moon. It’s a major milestone in the quest to establish a permanent human presence on other celestial bodies and launch energy intensive robotic missions to the outer solar system.\n\nAbout the size of a refrigerator, each Kilopower reactor will be capable of delivering up to 10 kilowatts of energy when they are ready to be deployed in space. To put this in perspective, this means each Kilopower reactor produces enough energy to power about 10 average American homes on Earth. NASA estimates that an array of four Kilopower reactors would be enough to sustain a decent-sized outpost on the moon or Mars for about a decade.\n\nAlthough the Kilopower reactor has been in development since 2012, testing on a 1- kilowatt prototype only began in November. The testing program, called the Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling Technology (KRUSTY), was undertaken at the Nevada National Security Site and meant to study the integrity of the reactor design in conditions similar to those in deep space. After placing the reactor in a vacuum chamber, researchers subjected the device to all kinds of critical failure scenarios, like power reduction, engine failure, and heat pipe failure. The experiments culminated in a full-power test that kept the reactor online for 28 hours.\n\nEverything worked flawlessly, even when the reactor was dealing with several failures at once.\n\n“We put the system through its paces,” Marc Gibson, the lead Kilopower engineer at NASA Glenn, said in a statement. “We understand the reactor very well, and this test proved that the system works the way we designed it to work. No matter what environment we expose it to, the reactor performs very well.”\n\nThis is great news for NASA, which has struggled since its inception to integrate nuclear reactors and space exploration. After billions of dollars spent on nuclear reactor designs that never made it to orbit, much less the moon, the KRUSTY program was the first successful test of a nuclear reactor intended for space applications over half-a-century. In fact, it is the first new operable fission reactor concept designed in the US in over 40 years. It heralds the beginning of a nuclear-powered era of space exploration, which will open the door to previously impossible missions into deep space, whether this is powering settlements on Mars or using robotic submarines to explore the icy oceans of Jovian moons.\n\nOn the moon and Mars, the most likely candidates for future human settlements, sources of energy are hard to come by. Unless Mars was once home to organic life, we’re not going to find any oil or coal there since these fossil fuels are mostly formed from dead plant matter. (Although Mars may harbor pockets of methane gas.) If Mars ever had an ocean or rivers, they have long since dried up, so no hydropower. The moon has no atmosphere and thus no way to harvest wind energy. Parts of the face of the moon can be shaded from the sun for stretches lasting up to 14 days, whereas Mars’ distance from the sun makes it hard to harvest enough solar power on the surface to power a rover, much less an entire settlement.\n\n“When we start sending astronauts for long stays on the Moon and to other planets, that’s going to require a new class of power that we’ve never needed before,” Gibson said.\n\nAn artist's depiction of a Kilopower reactor on the lunar surface. Image: NASA\n\nShipping oil, coal, or the components for vast solar arrays to the moon or Mars is far too resource intensive to be practical—that stuff is heavy, and every pound sent to space costs about $10,000 to get there. NASA needed a relatively lightweight, yet highly efficient energy source if it ever hoped to establish a long-term human presence on the moon or Mars.\n\nEnter uranium-235, the radioactive material that powers nuclear power plants around the world and is one of the most energy dense materials known on Earth. In fact, just one pound of enriched uranium fuel can produce as much energy as about 3 million pounds of coal.\n\n  READ MORE: WHAT IS URANIUM?\n\nNASA only needs a few dozen kilowatts worth of power for its initial lunar or Martian outposts. Since most nuclear power plants on Earth are designed to produce hundreds of kilowatts electricity, this meant that Gibson and his colleagues would have to come up with a new fission reactor design. Not only would it have to be compact enough to fit in a rocket fairing, it would also have to be powerful enough to host a settlement and designed in such a way that it could withstand the harsh space environment. If Gibson and his colleagues were successful, it would be an unprecedented feat of nuclear engineering.\n\nIn the last half century, over 40 nuclear reactors have been sent to space and almost all of them were Soviet. The only nuclear reactor that the US has ever sent to space was the SNAP-10A, a reactor developed by the Atomic Energy Agency and launched in 1965 to test its feasibility as a power supply for the CORONA satellite spy program. The reactor was able to produce 500 watts of power and was in low earth orbit for 43 days before the Air Force decommissioned the satellite. It is still in orbit as a piece of space junk and is predicted to remain there for another 4,000 years. Nevertheless, nuclear power continued to play a major role in US space exploration, even if reactors had been tossed to the wayside.\n\n[]\n\nSince the 1960s, almost every major NASA mission into deep space has relied on electricity produced by radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). These types of electric generators have no moving parts and don’t rely on nuclear fission. Instead, an array of electric conductors harvest the heat released by the natural decay of radioactive material (usually plutonium) and convert this heat into electrical energy.\n\nRTGs powered the Voyager 1, the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space; they powered the Cassini mission to Saturn for 20 years; they powered the New Horizons mission to Pluto and beyond; and continue to power a number of satellites and rovers on and around Mars. They are an ideal power supply for spacecraft insofar as they can produce a steady supply of electrical energy for decades with a relatively small amount of fuel. RTGs are, however, limited to an output of a few hundred watts. While this is enough to meet the demands of most spacecraft, which need to take measurements and communicate with Earth, more demanding robotic missions, like sending a submarine into the oceans of Europa, will demand a lot more energy.\n\nNuclear fission is the process of splitting the nucleus of an atom, usually with a neutron, which releases a tremendous amount of energy. At the same time, the split knocks other neutrons loose from the nucleus, which themselves split other atoms. This results in a cascading process of nuclear fission and a constant supply of heat energy. This process has been used to make the most destructive weapons ever created, as well as providing a relatively clean source of energy for civilian applications. (The downside of nuclear energy is that we still don’t know how to properly dispose of the waste, which remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years.) In a nuclear reactor, the heat released by splitting the nucleus of an atom—usually uranium-235—is used to heat water and generate steam, which turns a turbine to generate electricity.\n\nWhile this works well enough on Earth, conventional power plants are too big to build on the moon or Mars, and definitely wouldn’t fit inside a spacecraft. Smaller fission reactors are found on naval vessels like aircraft carriers and submarines, but these types of reactors also use steam to generate electricity. This precludes them from being adapted to space applications because they require a lot of water to work and water is a precious commodity in space.\n\nNASA considered various reactor designs for space applications after launching its only reactor in 1965, but most of these designs were considered too expensive to make and would require too much of a runway to ever be made in time for particular missions. The SP-100 reactor prototype developed in the 1980s was terminated after a decade and more than a billion dollars was spent on research. NASA’s Project Prometheus began in the early 2000s to investigate the use of nuclear reactors in space for propulsion and powering flight systems, but was terminated after nearly $400 million was spent on research and development.\n\nThe Kilopower reactor is put in a vacuum chamber for the KRUSTY project. Image: NASA\n\n\nBUILDING A BETTER NUCLEAR REACTOR\n\nAfter decades of failing to take a reactor design from paper into orbit, NASA joined forces with the Department of Energy and Lockheed Martin in 2008 to pursue a nuclear power source called an advanced Stirling radioisotope generator (ASRG) that would be four times as efficient as RTGs. The efficiency gains result from using a Stirling converter, a type of engine that relies on the heating and cooling of a gas to convert heat energy into electricity. The basic idea was that energy released by natural radioactive decay would be used to heat a gas, which would then expand. This pressure created by the expanding gas would be used to power an electric generator to produce electricity for a spacecraft. It was a novel design, but the research program on ASRG was mothballed in 2012 after costs began to drift tens of millions of dollars over budget without an end in sight.\n\nThat same year, however, researchers at NASA Glenn and the DOE’s Los Alamos National Laboratory achieved a breakthrough in a different type of nuclear power source that also relied on a Stirling converter. Keeping with the _Simpsons_ themed acronyms, the Demonstration Using Flattop Fissions (DUFF) used nuclear fission, rather than natural radioactive decay, as an energy source for a Stirling converter. The energy produced during fission is used to heat a sodium fluid in a “heat pipe,” and this heat is used to drive a Stirling converter which converts the heat energy into the mechanical motion needed to drive an electrical generator.\n\nAlthough DUFF only produced about 24 watts of power during its tests—not enough to power most light bulbs—it was the first successful test of a nuclear reactor intended for space applications made by NASA in nearly half-a-century. Its design prefigured Kilopower, which built on insights gleaned from the experiment to create a working prototype.\n\nThe Kilowatt reactor prototype that has been tested over the last few months uses two Stirling converters (the reactors that will eventually be sent to space will have eight converters) to produce up to 1 kilowatt of power. It’s core is a solid piece of uranium-235 that is about the size of a paper towel roll and a rod of boron carbide acts as a neutron moderator to control the bombardment of the uranium by neutrons. Before flight, the boron carbide would be fully inserted into the reactor to prevent a fission reaction. Once it is extracted, however, the fission reaction will begin and cannot be stopped completely, although the rate of fission—and hence heat output—can be controlled by the depth of the boron rod in the reactor. The heat from the fission reaction is used to heat liquid sodium, which transfers this heat to eight Stirling engines that convert the heat into mechanical motion to drive electric generators and produce electricity. The StirlingStriling engines used in the prototype were repurposed from the failed ASRG experiments, although McClure said custom Stirling engines will be developed for missions in the future.\n\nOne of the most staggering things about this design, however, is that this working nuclear reactor prototype was produced for only $18 million, an order of magnitude less than previous designs that never made it beyond the drawing board.\n\n“When we got started, we looked at all the projects that had gone on before us,” Patrick McClure, the lead Kilopower engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory told me on the phone. “We felt they made some mistakes by trying to build what I’m going to call a ‘sporty’ reactor. By sporty I mean they’re trying to get a lot of power for as low of a weight as possible. Some of their design choices were really pushing the bounds of engineering.”\n\nAn artist conception of four Kilopower units on Mars. NASA estimates that four reactors could power an initial outpost for a decade. Image: NASA\n\nRather than trying to reinvent the wheel, McClure said he and his colleagues working on Kilopower opted for more simple, cost effective reactor designs.\n\n“We’d much rather have a reactor that’s real then one that’s a great design, but only exists on paper,\" McClure said. \"We don’t want this to die.”\n\nMcClure told me that he and his colleagues are excited that the reactor works, but that there’s still a lot of work to do before it gets to space, much less a lunar or Martian colony. In addition to a safety review by NASA and an “ independent, interagency nuclear safety review panel,” it will need to be integrated into a specific mission so that the prototype can be designed to accommodate that mission’s needs. He said the Kilopower team is working with NASA management to determine the future of Kilopower, which will need to be tested in space before it's brought to the surface of the moon or Mars.\n\n“We're excited and relieved that we got the test done, but anxious about where we go next,” McClure said. “Our ultimate goal is to get a nuclear reactor back in space, and if NASA’s ever going to use the reactor, you have to prove to the folks doing missions that it will really work in space.”\n\n“There's clearly a desire to try to put one on the moon, but that might not happen until the mid-2020s,” McClure added. “The team would like to get one in space before then, but in the meantime we’ve got to convince some people.”\n\n\n",

    "passage": "How Doctors Think\n\n_HOW DOCTORS THINK_ is a book released in March 2007 by Jerome Groopman, the Dina and Raphael Recanati Chair of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, chief of experimental medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and staff writer for _The New Yorker_ magazine.[1]\n\nThe book opens with a discussion of a woman in her thirties who suffered daily stomach cramps and serious weight loss, and who visited some 30 doctors over a period of 15 years. Several misdiagnoses were made before she was finally found to have celiac disease.[2] Groopman explains that no one can expect a physician to be infallible, as medicine is an uncertain science, and every doctor sometimes makes mistakes in diagnosis and treatment. But the frequency and seriousness of those mistakes can be reduced by “understanding how a doctor thinks and how he or she can think better”.[3]\n\nThe book includes Groopman's own experiences both as an oncologist and as a patient, as well as interviews by Groopman of prominent physicians in the medical community. Notably, he describes his difficulties with a number of orthopedic surgeons as he sought treatment for a debilitating ligament laxity he suffered in his right hand, which over several years had led to the formation of cysts in the bones of his wrist.[4]\n\n\nSalem's challenge\n\nGroopman spends a great deal of the book discussing the challenge posed to him by Dr. Deeb Salem, chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at Tufts-New England Medical Center, during a presentation the author made at their hospital grand rounds. During the presentation, Groopman was discussing the importance of compassion and communication in providing medical care when Salem posed the following question:\n\n  There are primary care physicians in every hospital who speak with great sensitivity and concern, and their longtime patients love them, but clinically they are incompetent--how is a patient to know this?[5]\n\nAt the time of the presentation, Groopman was unable to provide a satisfactory response. Salem's question reminded Groopman of his experiences with physicians at the Phillips House of the world-renowned Massachusetts General Hospital, where he trained as a resident in the 1970s. Per his account:\n\n  A few of [the physicians at Philips House] were highly skilled, but several were, at best, marginal in their clinical acumen. Nonetheless, their patients were devoted to them. It was the job of the residents to plug the holes in these marginal doctors' care. Just as a physician has to be wary of his first impression of a patient's condition, as a patient you have to be careful of your first impression of a physician...Thankfully, fewer students are admitted to medical school now because of social standing and family connections than at the time of my training. America has become more of a meritocracy in the professions. Medical school admissions committees no longer accept a record of gentlemen's C's at an Ivy League college.\n  At best, I said to Salem, a layman should inquire of friends and, if possible, other physicians as well as nurses about the clinical qualities of a doctor beyond his personality. His credentials can be found on the Internet or by contacting a local medical board...Salem's query required a much more comprehensive answer, which I hope this book will help provide.[6]\n\n\nThe availability heuristic\n\nEarly in the work, Groopman discusses the work of Amos Tversky and Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, psychologists from Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Specifically, he explores their development in the early 1980s of a concept known as the availability heuristic.[7]\n\nIn the theory, “availability” is defined as the tendency to judge the likelihood of explanation for an event by the ease with which relevant examples come to mind. In a clinical situation a diagnosis may be made because the physician often sees similar cases in his practice — for example, the misclassification of aspirin toxicity as a viral pneumonia, or the improper recognition of an essential tremor as _delirium tremens_ due to alcohol withdrawal in an indigent urban setting. Groopman argues that a clinician will misattribute a general symptom as specific to a certain disease based on the frequency he encounters that disease in his practice.[8]\n\nKahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for his work on heuristics, an honor that Groopman believes Tversky would have shared had he not died in 1996.[9]\n\n\nLack of recognition for gatekeepers\n\nGroopman also serves as an advocate for primary care physicians in his book. He argues that gatekeeper physicians are underreimbursed for their work, believing this to be a legacy of the period earlier this century when surgeons headed the medical societies that negotiated with insurers about what a 'customary' payment for services was to be.[10]\n\nHe suggests that the poor reimbursement and lack of recognition for primary care physicians is fundamentally flawed. He quotes Dr. Eric J. Cassell's book, _Doctoring: The Nature of Primary Care Medicine_, to defend his assertion:\n\n  A common error in thinking about primary care is to see it as entry-level medicine...and, because of this, rudimentary medicine...This is a false notion. One should not confuse highly technical, even complicated, medical knowledge--special practical knowledge about an unusual disease, treatment, condition, or technology--with the complex, many-sided worldly-wise knowledge we expect of the best physicians.\n  The narrowest subspecialist, the reasoning goes, should also be able to provide this [broad] range of medical services. This naive idea arises, as do so many other wrong beliefs about primary care, because of the concept that doctors take care of diseases. Diseases, the idea goes on, form a hierarchy from simple to difficult. Specialists take care of difficult diseases, so, of course, they will naturally do a good job on simple diseases. Wrong. Doctors take care of people, some of whom have diseases and all of whom have some problem. People used to doing complicated things usually do complicated things in simple situations--for example, ordering tests or x-rays when waiting a few days might suffice--thus overtreating people with simple illnesses and overlooking the clues about other problems that might have brought the patient to the doctor.[11]\n\n\nThe fallacy of logic\n\nIn a later chapter Groopman reports a frank discussion with Dr. James E. Lock, chief of cardiology at Boston Children's Hospital. During their conversation, Groopman asks the world-renowned cardiologist about the times in his career when he made mistakes in patient treatment.[12]\n\nTo the query, Lock gives the cryptic response, “All my mistakes have the same things in common.”[13]\n\nLock then elaborates, discussing recommendations he made to repair specific heart defects in neonates that ultimately led to worse clinical outcomes and potentially avoidable deaths. The recommendations he made were based on a purely logical understanding of cardiac physiology.[14] The crucial point of Lock's discussion came with his confession:\n\n  Impeccable logic doesn't always suffice. My mistake was that I reasoned from first principles when there was no prior experience. I turned out to be wrong because there are variables that you can't factor in until you actually do it. And you make the wrong recommendation, and the patient doesn't survive. I didn't leave enough room for what seems [sic] like minor effects--the small fluctuations in oxygen levels, which might amount to one or two or three percent but actually can signal major problems in the heart....[The proposed treatment] is very sound logic. But it's wrong...These children developed right heart failure and clinically they became worse. There are aspects to human biology and human physiology that you just can't predict. Deductive reasoning doesn't work for every case. Sherlock Holmes is a model detective, but human biology is not a theft or a murder where all the cues can add up neatly.[15]\n\nGroopman goes on to write, “Lock averted his gaze and his face fell; to be wrong about a child is a form of suffering unique to his profession [as a pediatrician].”[16]\n\n\nDisregard of uncertainty\n\nGroopman also discusses the work of Renee Fox, a physician and occupational sociologist who observed residents and attendings in a hospital ward setting, noting their various ways of coping with the uncertainties of medical treatment. The mechanisms to cope that Fox observed included, for example, black humor, making bets about who would be right about a patient's prognosis, and engaging in magical thinking to maintain a sense of poise and competence in front of patients while performing circumspect procedures.[17]\n\nJay Katz, a clinical instructor at Yale Law School has since termed these coping mechanisms under the rubric 'disregard of uncertainty', which he believes physicians develop to deal with the anxiety of shifting from the certainty of theoretical discussions of medicine early in their training to its more happenstance practical application.[18]\n\nGroopman recalls that in situations where he had been hesitant to take clinical action based on incomplete data, it had been wisest at times to follow the advice of his mentor Dr. Linda A. Lewis: “Don't just do something, stand there.” Groopman asserts that there exist situations in which inaction may be the wisest course of action.[19]\n\n\nSuggestions for patients\n\nGroopman closes with an epilogue giving advice for patients. He gives the following tools that patients can use to help reduce or rectify cognitive errors:\n\n-   Ask WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?, combating satisfaction of search bias and leading the doctor to consider a broader range of possibilities.\n-   Ask IS THERE ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T FIT?, combatting confirmation bias and again leading the doctor to think broadly.\n-   Ask IS IT POSSIBLE I HAVE MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM?, because multiple simultaneous disorders do exist and frequently cause confusing symptoms.\n-   TELL WHAT YOU ARE MOST WORRIED ABOUT, opening discussion and leading either to reassurance (if the worry is unlikely) or careful analysis (if the worry is plausible).\n-   RETELL THE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING. Details that were omitted in the initial telling may be recalled, or different wording or the different context may make clues more salient. (This is most appropriate when the condition has not responded to treatment or there is other reason to believe that a misdiagnosis is possible.)\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n",

    "passage": "The Siamese Twin Mystery\n\n_THE SIAMESE TWIN MYSTERY_ is an English language American novel written in 1933 by Ellery Queen. It is the seventh of the Ellery Queen mysteries.\n\n\nPlot summary\n\nInspector Queen and his son Ellery are vacationing in a mountainous area of the United States when they are forced by a forest fire to seek shelter at Arrow Head, the mountaintop home of famous surgeon Dr. John Xavier, which soon becomes impossible to escape due to the fire. There the sleuths meet an unusual assortment of characters, beginning with Dr. Xavier and his wife Sarah; his brother Mark; his medical assistant Percival Holmes; his handyman “Bones”; the housekeeper, Mrs. Wheary; and a houseguest, Ann Forrest. Miss Forrest has recently lost a silver ring; Dr. Holmes likewise finds himself missing a cheap signet ring. That night, Ellery spies a strange crab-like shape moving in the upstairs hallway, and, independently, Inspector Queen discovers that also present at the house is the wealthy Marie Carreau, a fixture of Washington high society; Ann is Mrs. Carreau's personal secretary. In the morning, Dr. Xavier is found dead in his study — shot twice with a revolver which has been wiped clean of any fingerprints. In his right hand he clutches the torn half of a playing card: the six of spades.\n\nThe previous night, the Queens had encountered on the road a heavyset and unsavory man, who — his escape blocked by the fire — now returns to the house, giving his name unconvincingly as “Smith.” It is further revealed that Marie Carreau had come to the house to consult with Dr. Xavier on the subject of her teenage sons, Julian and Francis, who are xiphopagous conjoined twins. It was the twins who had cast the crab-like shadow seen by Ellery in the hallway. Meanwhile, the Inspector makes the connection between the _six_ of spades and Mrs. Xavier's initials — Sarah Isère Xavier — and accuses her of murdering the surgeon in a jealous rage at his lengthy conferences with Mrs. Carreau. Mrs. Xavier instantly confesses to the murder and collapses in a faint. However, Ellery observes that Dr. Xavier, who was right-handed, would naturally have used his right hand to crumple and discard half of the card, which would leave the uncrumpled half clutched in his _left_ hand. It follows that the playing card must have been torn and placed in Xavier's hand by some left-handed person — that is, by the murderer.\n\nThe Queens investigate Dr. Xavier's laboratory and find that Xavier has been experimenting with the separation of conjoined twins of various animal species — always without success — and that “Bones” has been burying the failures in the garden. That night, the Queens search Mrs. Xavier's jewel-box and find that it contains no rings at all. The next morning, the party attempt to find a way past the increasingly menacing forest fire, but to no avail. Ellery observes a conversation between Smith and Mrs. Carreau, and deduces that Smith had been blackmailing Carreau, threatening to publicize the existence of her sons — but that the murder, sure to draw publicity, had neutralized Smith's hold over Carreau. The Queens conduct a series of “tests” to prove that each member of the party is right-handed, _except for Mark Xavier_; on this evidence, Ellery accuses Mark of murdering Dr. Xavier and planting the card to throw suspicion on Mrs. Xavier. Mark, in a panic, tries to escape; Inspector Queen shoots him and returns him to the house, gravely wounded. Mark confesses that he planted the torn card to frame Mrs. Xavier, but insists that Dr. Xavier was dead before Mark entered the room — and insists that he knows who the killer is! But Holmes' morphine takes effect before Mark can reveal the murderer's identity. Inspector Queen stands watch over Mark and is there at 1 a.m. when Mark regains consciousness; but when Ellery comes down at 2 a.m. to check on his father, he finds the Inspector chloroformed and Mark Xavier dead — poisoned by oxalic acid — clutching in his right hand the torn half of a jack of diamonds.\n\nEllery finds Mrs. Carreau awake in her room, which is suspicious. Inspector Queen discovers that while he was chloroformed, somebody stole the wedding ring off his finger. The party return to their rooms. When somebody tries to break into the safe where Xavier's original deck of playing cards was being kept as evidence, Ellery on a hunch counts the cards in that deck and discovers that it is missing _two_ cards — the six of spades and the jack of diamonds! The Queens deduce that when Mark found his brother's body, Dr. Xavier had been clutching a torn _jack_, which Mark _replaced_ with the six of spades to frame his sister-in-law (because with her out of the way, Mark stood to inherit Xavier's estate). When Mark in turn was murdered, he must have decided that the best way to clue at his murderer's identity would be to reproduce Dr. Xavier's authentic clue — the jack of diamonds. Further, Ellery observes that the French name for the suit of diamonds is _carreaux_, and the image on a jack is that of two conjoined young men! He concludes that (because the card was torn in half) only _one_ of the Carreau twins is the murderer, and suggests that the twin may have killed Xavier in self-defense, out of fear that Xavier would try (and fail) to separate the twins surgically. The Queens speculate on the “beautiful headache” such a case would present: Murder is a capital offense, but supposing only one of the twins to be guilty of murder, what would become of the other?\n\nMeanwhile, the fire has been creeping closer and closer to the summit. An airplane drops a message from the local sheriff, informing the party that all attempts to contain the fire have failed and advising them to dig firebreaks around the house. They dig through the night and into the following afternoon; but the fire jumps their trench and reaches the house. The party retreat to the cellar as the house burns above them. Ellery now confronts the blackmailer Smith; it is revealed that Smith was one of the doctors in attendance at the Carreau twins' birth, and has been blackmailing Mrs. Carreau for sixteen years. Ellery now rejects his theory that the murderer is one of the twins, and even that the torn jack of diamonds is an authentic clue at all. The jack in Xavier's right hand, which Mark had replaced with a six to frame Mrs. Xavier, _still_ could not have been an authentic clue from the right-handed Xavier. Furthermore, Ellery discovered the missing jack only after the murderer's feeble attempt to break into the safe, when all the time the key to the safe was in the pocket of the chloroformed Inspector Queen! This indicates that the murderer was trying to draw attention to the Carreau twins — and away from his true identity.\n\nAs the party continue to cower below the burning house, Ellery comes to the matter of the missing rings. As the murderer nonsensically removed even Inspector Queen's wedding band, he concludes that the murderer must be a kleptomaniac on the specific subject of rings. He dramatically removes his own ring, places it in the center of the room, and waits for the kleptomaniac to crack. The gambit works; Mrs. Xavier cannot stand the tension and shrieks her confession. Her jewel-box contained no rings because Dr. Xavier had known of her kleptomania; that was why he'd kept her isolated on the mountain away from anything that could trigger it. She indeed _had_ killed her husband out of jealousy; planted the torn card to frame the Carreau twins; and, when accused by Ellery, confessed _truthfully_ — which told Mark that he'd accidentally “framed” the real murderer. She then killed Mark, _again_ leaving a jack of diamonds in an attempt to frame the Carreaus.\n\nHaving confessed, Mrs. Xavier dashes up the cellar stairs and disappears into the flames — certainly to her death. A few minutes later, it begins to rain.\n\n\nLiterary significance and criticism\n\nThe character of Ellery Queen and the more-or-less locked room mystery were probably initially suggested by the novels featuring detective Philo Vance by S.S. Van Dine, which were very popular at the time. At this point in time, however, Van Dine's sales were dropping and Queen's were beginning to rise. This novel was the seventh in a long series of novels featuring Ellery Queen, the first nine containing a nationality in the title.\n\nThe introduction to this novel contained a detail which is now not considered part of the Ellery Queen canon. The introduction is written as by the anonymous “J.J. McC.”, a friend of the Queens. Other details of the lives of the fictional Queen family contained in earlier introductions have now disappeared and are never mentioned again; the introductory device of “J.J. McC.” lasts only through the tenth novel, _Halfway House_, then vanishes (though J.J. appears onstage in _Face to Face_ in 1967).\n\nThe “nationality” mysteries had the unusual feature of a “Challenge to the Reader” just before the ending is revealed—the novel breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the reader, stating that all essential facts have been revealed and the solution to the mystery is now possible. The first paperback edition of this novel does not contain such a challenge, possibly because World War II paper restrictions in the United States meant that all unessential material must be trimmed.\n",

    "answer_model": "The torn half of a playing card is found in Dr. Xavier's hand. The Queens investigate Dr. Xavier's laboratory and find that Xavier has been experimenting with the separation of conjoined twins of various animal species — always without success — and that “Bones” has been burying the failures in the garden. That night, the Queens search Mrs. Xavier's jewel-box and find that it contains no rings at all. Ellery observes a conversation between Smith and Mrs. Carreau, and deduces that Smith had been blackmailing Carreau, threatening to publicize the existence of her sons — but that the murder, sure to draw publicity, had neutralized Smith's hold over Carreau. The Queens conduct a series of “tests” to prove that each member of the party is right-handed, _except for Mark Xavier_; on this evidence, Ellery accuses Mark of murdering Dr. Xavier and planting the card to throw suspicion on Mrs. Xavier. Mark, in a panic, tries to escape; Inspector Queen shoots him and returns him to the house, gravely wounded. Mark confesses that he planted the torn card to frame Mrs. Xavier, but insists that Dr. Xavier was dead before Mark entered the room — and insists that he knows who the killer is! But Holmes' morphine takes effect before Mark can reveal the murderer's identity. Inspector Queen stands watch over Mark and is there at 1 a.m. when Mark regains consciousness; but when Ellery comes down at 2 a.m. to check on his father, he finds the Inspector chloroformed and Mark Xavier dead — poisoned by oxalic acid — clutching in his right hand the torn half of a jack of diamonds. Ellery finds Mrs. Carreau awake in her room, which is suspicious. Inspector Queen discovers that while he was chloroformed, somebody stole the wedding ring off his finger. When somebody tries to break into the safe where Xavier's original deck of playing cards was being kept as evidence, Ellery on a hunch counts the cards in that deck and discovers that it is missing _two_ cards — the six of spades and the jack of diamonds! The Queens deduce that when Mark found his brother's body, Dr. Xavier had been clutching a torn _jack_, which Mark _replaced_ with the six of spades to frame his sister-in-law (because with her out of the way, Mark stood to inherit Xavier's estate). When Mark in turn was murdered, he must have decided that the best way to clue at his murderer's identity would be to reproduce Dr. Xavier's authentic clue — the jack of diamonds. Further, Ellery observes that the French name for the suit of diamonds is _carreaux_, and the image on a jack is that of two conjoined young men! He concludes that (because the card was torn in half) only _one_ of the Carreau twins is the murderer, and suggests that the twin may have killed Xavier in self-defense, out of fear that Xavier would try (and fail) to separate the twins surgically. The Queens speculate on the “beautiful headache” such a case would present: Murder is a capital offense, but supposing only one of the twins to be guilty of murder, what would become of the other? Meanwhile, the fire has been creeping closer and closer to the summit. An airplane drops a message from the local sheriff, informing the party that all attempts to contain the fire have failed and advising them to dig firebreaks around the house. They dig through the night and into the following afternoon; but the fire jumps their trench and reaches the house. The party retreat to the cellar as the house burns above them. Ellery now confronts the blackmailer Smith; it is revealed that Smith was one of the doctors in attendance at the Carreau twins' birth, and has been blackmailing Mrs. Carreau for sixteen years. Ellery now rejects his theory that the murderer is one of the twins, and even that the torn jack of diamonds is an authentic clue at all. The jack in Xavier's right hand, which Mark had replaced with a six to frame Mrs. Xavier, _still_ could not have been an authentic clue from the right-handed Xavier. Furthermore, Ellery discovered the missing jack only after the murderer's feeble attempt to break into the safe, when all the time the key to the safe was in the pocket of the chloroformed Inspector Queen! This indicates that the murderer was trying to draw attention to the Carreau twins — and away from his true identity. As the party continue to cower below the burning house, Ellery comes to the matter of the missing rings. As the murderer nonsensically removed even Inspector Queen's wedding band, he concludes that the murderer must be a kleptomaniac on the specific subject of rings. He dramatically removes his own ring, places it in the center of the room, and waits for the kleptomaniac to crack. The gambit works; Mrs. Xavier cannot stand the tension and shrieks her confession. Her jewel-box contained no rings because Dr. Xavier had known of her kleptomania; that was why he'd kept her isolated on the mountain away from anything that could trigger it. She indeed _had_ killed her husband out of jealousy; planted the torn card to frame the Carreau twins; and, when accused by Ellery, confessed _truthfully_ — which told Mark that he'd accidentally “framed” the real murderer. She then killed Mark, _again_ leaving a jack of diamonds in an attempt to frame the Carreaus. Having confessed, Mrs. Xavier dashes up the cellar stairs and disappears into the flames — certainly to her death. A few minutes later, it begins to rain.",

    "passage": "[]\n\nPlayers will be traveling to the Victorian era for the newest entry in the Assassin's Creed series, managing a gang and taking London back from the Templars. Those are the broad strokes, but we spoke with Assassin's Creed Syndicate's creative director, Marc-Alexis Côté, to get more info about the characters, setting, and improvements in this year's installment.\n\nThese question delve into the details, so make sure you have the basics covered by reading about the 5 Things You Should Know About Assassin's Creed Syndicate.\n\nUNLIKE SOME PREVIOUS AC SETTINGS, VICTORIAN LONDON IS WELL-REPRESENTED IN ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA. HOW DO YOU APPROACH MAKING SOMETHING FAMILIAR FEEL UNIQUE TO PLAYERS?\nIt’s really easy to fall into the clichés of the era, and this is why it requires a lot of thought and a lot of research…For the first time in the history of the brand, we are tackling an era where we have photographs. We have videos. Just a bit later, like the 1880s, but that’s what gave us inspiration for things like building the traffic system – seeing the streets of London being so filled with people.\n\nOne of the keys to tackling this is era is that it’s an era of peace. Over the last few years, we’ve been covering periods of war. [Syndicate] brings us back to the magic of Assassin’s Creed II, the Renaissance, which was an era of peace, progress, and transformation for humanity. That’s the magic I want to capture – the magic of innovation, of change, and to make our players feel that.\n\nPeople think about the Victorian era, sometimes they think about the darker aspects. But there was so much more to it; it’s the era of Charles Darwin, it’s the era of Charles Dickens – and other characters that I cannot name. So many things were invented during that era, and it will be great to share with our players.\n\n[]\n\nSO, WE’LL BE SEEING MORE FAMOUS FIGURES JUMPING IN AND OUT OF THE STORY?\nYeah, absolutely. One of the things that’s so different about this game is that it all occurs in 1868. This being an era of peace, we don’t have to take the player from battle to battle and constantly move the clocks. The game starts in 1868, it ends in 1868. We’re really focusing on immersing the player – for example, we’re bringing back the day and night cycle. We really want players to feel like part of this environment. We’re also making it about our two characters – about their stories and development. About meeting people and being influenced by them. So, you meet those historical characters in the main storyline, and then it will open up threads you can follow to learn more about Charles Darwin, for example.\n\nIT’S ALL SET IN 1868 – IS IT ALL SET IN LONDON?\nWhat we’re revealing today is that Assassin’s Creed Syndicate takes place in London.\n\nDO THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS – JACOB AND EVIE – HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES? OR DO PLAYERS JUST APPLY UPGRADES INDEPENDENTLY?\nBoth characters have different skill trees and playstyles that reflect their personalities.\n\nARE YOU TAKING A SIMILAR APPROACH TO UNITY REGARDING THE MODERN-DAY STORYLINE?\nYes, we are following in the footsteps of Unity, and we’ll be talking more throughout the summer about exactly what we are doing with the present-day storyline.\n\nBY ADDING VEHICLES, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT PLAYERS LOSING INTEREST IN CLIMBING AROUND THE WORLD?\nThat’s not what I’m seeing right now when I see people play the game. We’re introducing a lot of player choice; we see players doing things differently than before, but parkour stays an integral part of the gameplay. Recall all of the facades that you see in the trailer; we’ve got some of the most amazing parkour elements. You need to stalk your targets, follow them, and you can’t do that from the middle of a rooftop. So parkour is absolutely an integral part of the experience.\n\n[]\n\nSPEAKING OF YOUR TARGETS – IN THE EARLIER ASSASSIN’S CREED GAMES, PLAYERS HAD A CLEARER IDEA OF WHO THEY WERE GOING AFTER AND WHY. HOW ARE THE TARGETS PRESENTED IN SYNDICATE?\nWhat I can tell you is that we’re returning to an approach that is closer to the roots of the franchise. You know from the start who your target is and what the organization is. Our two heroes give themselves the mission of taking the organization down. And they know what it is; there’s no mystery about who you are going to kill. You know from the start. And what I like about this is that it’s an open-world set-up – you know your targets are there, you know they’re in the world, and you have to go after them.\n\nCAN YOU GIVE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW ALL OF YOUR ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTE TO THE ROOKS’ TAKEOVER?\nAbsolutely. Each borough has a series of activities related to it, and your goal is take control of the city, borough after borough. In each of those, you’ll have gang strongholds. You’ll be able to liberate children from Templar factories. You’ll have fight clubs… Once you’ve done enough of those activities, you’ll draw the attention of the Templars. Like we saw in the demo, the City of London area was under the control of Bloody Nora, and she came out and challenged you to a gang war. The gang war is pretty much the capper to conquering the borough. Once you’ve won the gang war, it’s under your control. What this changes is the ecosystem of the borough. The more you shift the power, the more the Rooks will be present and available to recruit, so that they come and move around the city with you.\n\nOne of the things that’s cool with that is that they are aware. Say you’ve got five Rooks with you, and you move onto a growler. A growler has four seats, including the driver’s seat – so there’s only space for three Rooks. One goes into the passenger seat, two come into the carriage, and the other two will actually steal another cart and join you. So you really have the impression that you are moving with your gang and that you can use them to attack your target, invade another borough, even in the main missions.\n\n[]\n\nWITH THE FOCUS ON THE GANG, DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS FOR MULTIPLAYER?\nOne of the things that’s happening this year is that there will be no co-op and no multiplayer. We’re focusing on the single-player experience, and we’ve got all of our nine studios working on that experience to deliver something that’s very polished to our players this holiday season.\n\nIt’s really about returning to our roots. Returning to what made this series such a success. For us, it’s truly the single-player experience, and investing in that that’s going to make Assassin’s Creed feel more modern and fresh for our players.\n\nPREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS HAVE LET PLAYERS CUSTOMIZE A BASE OF OPERATIONS, LIKE MONTERIGGIONI AND THE JACKDAW. DOES SYNDICATE HAVE ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES?\nLike in Assassin’s Creed Unity, the players are one of the customizable aspects. London is something they can invest in as well and we’ll get into the details of how this will work over the summer. As for the player’s base of operation, we’ll reveal more about that over the summer as we have something cool and new in store for our players.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT SWORD CANE AND HOW THAT’S USED?\nThe sword cane is something that we’re going to talk more about later on. Sorry! It’s there to tease you…so it worked!\n\n[]\n\nIT SEEMS LIKE YOU’RE MAKING SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS OVER UNITY, BUT WHAT ELEMENTS OF THAT GAME DO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE CARRY OVER INTO SYNDICATE?\nAssassin’s Creed Unity made huge investments in the crowds and the crowd ecosystem. This is something we’re bringing to the next level with the police, but it is enabled by the technology from Assassin’s Creed Unity.\n\nFROM A COMBAT PERSPECTIVE, WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES PLAYERS WILL NOTICE BETWEEN UNITY AND SYNDICATE?\nIn Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, we’re keeping the same philosophy as Assassin’s Creed Unity. The combat will be challenging for the player. In my opinion, if combat is too easy, there’s no point in having stealth. You’ll just mow through everybody and it unbalances the game, so we’re keeping the philosophy of making fights harder. What people will find is that the fights are more responsive. We’ve cut the latency in half, so you can quickly jump from one target to another. We’ve shifted the initiative to the player away from the A.I. – we’re still working on it – but making sure the A.I. doesn’t wait for their turn, and that you have to stun your enemy and do crowd control.\n\nCONSIDERING UNITY’S TECHNICAL ISSUES AT LAUNCH, WHAT IS THE TEAM DOING TO AVOID ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THAT?\nI think we’ve talked a lot about it as a company over the last year. This year, we’re focusing on the single-player experience. I’m sure you don’t recall seeing Assassin’s Creed [at this stage] this early in the cycle; we’re showing it on console today. We’re doing playtests earlier than we’ve ever done them and integrating the feedback into the experience. Not to say we weren’t doing playtests in the past, but we’re doing them much earlier and play-testing the entire experience. This is all stuff we’re doing to ensure that players can be happy on day one, and say how great a game this is.\n",

    "passage": "[RF] Panicky Buzz\n\nI had just finished smoking my Black and Mild with Brandon and Ryan when it happened. Cary didn’t want to smoke one. I had drank for a while because I thought I didn’t want to feel like myself, thought I should have fun because it’s the weekend. I had thrown up after 4 mixed drinks and a forty. Then had a couple more mixed drinks because throwing up sort of killed my buzz. I didn’t tell anyone I threw up, just calmly stole some of friends gum without him noticing, went to the bathroom, listened to my favorite Bob Dylan song, and got it over with. Then I cleaned it up, blew my nose, and chewed the gum. That stall was probably cleaner now than it was before. \n\n \n\n“You good, Colin?”\n\n\n\n“Yeah, I just had to take a massive shit from that burrito.”\n\n\n\nThe four of us are signed up to go canoeing in the morning, which means I’ll have to wake up at 7:30. Ryan and I are both displeased with the vibe in the room for very different, but equally mistaken and embittered reasons. He’s sitting right in front of me, and I get a text from him asking if we should go get the Black and Milds. We both know the reason we’re getting the little cigars, but I can’t quite shake the feeling that we’re trying to live up to some romantic ideal for ourselves that isn’t accurate. But, either I’m relieved to get out of that room or I’m excited to see myself as a guy who drinks all night, then caps the night with a cigar so we head out. Does a Black and Mild even count as a cigar? Its about 1, so I say sure settling on getting 6 hours of sleep rather than the 8 I originally planned because I earnestly wanted to be well-rested for the canoeing trip. \n\n\nI enjoyed the Black and Mild. It tasted kind of good and felt a bit of a head buzz so I was happy that I could place a positive, tangible reason that I actually felt onto the experience. I had been texting Lily throughout the night – keeping the option open of potentially fucking her, even though I really did want to get some sleep. Luckily, she was just as apathetic about our arrangement that would be better described as a convenience than a relationship. Lily texted me asking if was awake, which is abnormal; usually I have to contact her, even though she seems to want to have sex every time I ask. I go back up to Ryan’s room one last time to get my backpack with the empty bottles of cranberry juice, orange juice, a Naked smoothie, and the quarter-full handle of Taaka – the cheapest vodka around. \n\n\nAs I pass through the lobby of Branscomb, Ryan’s dorm, to leave to go to Lily’s room, is when it happened, specifically. I got a double dose of that panicky buzz that I always sadistically look forward to – seeing a girl I once hooked up with who decided that it probably isn’t in her best interest to do that anymore or ever again. I say double dose because on this special night, I saw Emma and Olivia together, dressed nicely, presumably coming back from some frat or some bar. \n\n\nThey’re friends? I wonder if Emma told Olivia anything about me. I hope so. I hope Olivia didn’t tell Emma anything about me. I bet they went to Tin Roof. I should have went to Tin Roof. If I was drunk enough at Tin Roof I might have been able to get with one of them. Why is this even bothering me right now? I’m going to fuck another girl, and I hooked up with both of them, and I didn’t even have to go to Tin Roof. Well, I just made out with Olivia, so doesn’t really count. But, regardless, I should feel good about myself. If 16 year old Colin saw me in this situation, and knew that I was still unhappy, he’d hate me. Why do I care so much about what 16 year old Colin would think of me? \n\n\nI quietly, and slightly nervously – which I bet they perceived as unfriendily – say hi to them. I wish was friendlier. Its 2:00 now so I’ll probably end up only getting 4 or 5 hours sleep. Why do I care so much about these two girls? I quickly reminisce about what went wrong with each of them, and ignore the sense that each time I do that – which un-coincidentally happens each time I pass one of them on campus – the story becomes more distorted, more of an illusion. \n\n\nI fucked it up with Olivia more recently so I once again run through the thoughts that have come to define that situation in my head. I was lucky enough to stumble onto charmingness when I met her one Thursday night at a bar. It was one of those nights that every drunk is chasing no matter how long ago the last time it happened was. I created a romantic conception of myself that I actually liked, and, imagine that, she liked it too. We went back to campus together from the bar. My conception of myself managed to make out with her a few times, but she told me she had class at 9am the next morning when I tried to take it further. I believed her and figured that I still sealed the deal; next time I saw her I should be able to have sex with her, she’ll be able to see me as funny, charming, and capable. I send a few mediocre texts trying to be friendly over the next couple weeks. We fail to meet up at a bar a few times because we’re both not going out (drinking) the same night. How could I be charming if I was sober the next time we met? Is she just thinking of excuses so she doesn’t have to see me? We finally meet up and I fail to recreate the same excitement, the same passion as the first night. I’m a little more myself – a little less charming. The night ends without passion, without a sense of connection, without us hooking up. A few more texts, a little more passion dies. I sense the dying connection between us (probably before she does) and my frustration is manifest in some drunk texts that hasten the process I was trying to prevent. Now we quietly say hi to each other if we happen to pass on campus. I run through all of this by the time I’m at the door of the lobby of Branscomb.\n\n\nThen I’m onto the Emma situation. We met at Lonnie’s on one of the few other lucky nights where I managed to be charming while drunk. She is a friend of friend that I went to the bar with. We get to talking; we get to making out – the rest is a little hazy. We meet up at a frat another night. I make a move before I feel my charm wearing off just like a health bar would in a video game. She is luckily unperturbed by this quick move. We get to making out and even to fucking later that night. This lifts my spirits enough to feel like talking to her, feel like being friendly, and I end up thinking we genuinely connected. She’s really busy, seemingly, doesn’t want a relationship right now, but we agree we should hang out again sometime. Would she want a relationship if I had more social clout? It’s not that I even want a relationship, but I don’t want her to decide that we’re not going to have a relationship. I want to be undeniably great to her. I text her a few times about meeting at some bar, or some frat. Doesn’t happen. Text again. No response. I decided to ask our mutual friend if she knew what was going on. I didn’t see any reason why Emma would be avoiding me. Some minor investigative work leads to following conclusion.\n\n\n“Oh, Emma has a boyfriend now. She wasn’t really looking for one, but the hot guy from Kappa Sig asked her to go to the symphony with him, and they’ve been on a few dates now.”\n\nThe hot guy from Kappa Sig? The symphony? I tend to focus more on the conclusion rather than the rising action of this story. I kept this all to myself for as long as could. A few months later, I drunkenly told my buddy Mike from back home laughed and called him a faggot. I agreed. He also tells me I shouldn’t stress about her because the kind of girl that would have sex the second time you meet her isn’t really worth getting upset about. I didn’t agree, but I kept that to myself. \n\n\nI’m halfway to Lily’s dorm now, thinking about how I’ve never seen Emma and Olivia together. They’re in different sororities; I had no idea they were friends. How could I do better? How can I make sure this shit doesn’t keep happening to me? Or do I actually want this to keep happening to me to appeal to some over-romanticized view of myself as a self-destructive hedonist who can’t catch a break with women? I don’t know. It’s all too confusing. I get to Lily’s room and we have sex so I don’t think about it for a while. I end up getting just 3 hours of sleep before the canoeing trip, but it didn’t end up being a problem because I slept on the way there and got some caffeine.\n\n \nThe next day I call my girl back home, Morgan, because I’m feeling down on myself. She actually seems to like listening to me whine for some odd reason. I always figure that if I don’t want to hear it from myself, why would anyone else? I’m just figuring out that’s not always true, but I’m always secretively suspicious that they don’t actually, that they’re listening for some other reason. I never meant to tell Morgan any of this, but she kind of likes it when I talk about other girls. I think it’s weird, but she says it’d be worse if nobody other than her was attracted to me. I feel simultaneously lucky and completely un-special. \n\n\nShe asks about Lily, and I get into how angry I am with myself for reminiscing how I fucked up with two other girls as I am on my way to see one that I actually enjoy being with. Why can’t I let myself enjoy it? Why was I still thinking about what I don’t have? I sense the path that leads to the answers of these questions when I’m on the phone with her. She brings me to these conclusions somehow, even though she never explicitly suggests them. The paths to them just become illuminated. I say to her that I wish I could have went up to them and hugged Olivia and Emma, asked them how their night went, genuinely care about their well-being. I tell her that they put me on a tight rope between arrogance and insecurity. When I think about Olivia, I fall of to the left, thinking that I don’t have anything to offer. I can only keep up the illusion that I’m a commodity for so long. When I think about Emma start to lean right, thinking Duke girls aren’t worth my time. They don’t appreciate me enough. I start to sway to left and think that my best wasn’t even good enough for her, but the wind blasts me to the ground off the right side, and I finally conclude that Mike was right, and she wasn’t even worth it because of her lack of appreciation for me. \n\n\nThis makes me realize what an egomaniac I am, and I get a sense of existential dread that all my work has failed and somehow led to me being this hypocritical, insecure asshole. I don’t even think we have that great a connection with either of them, but I hate that they made that decision. What do I really want? I want them to love me. I want them to be incapable of keeping their mind off me. It doesn’t seem like this is the case. What, they make me feel un-special? Well, they could either be right or wrong. On worse days, I tend to think they’re right. On happier but equally ignorant days, they’re wrong. On the very rare, but absolute best of days, they’re right, but I don’t care. That’s what I want to be working towards, but I don’t feel like I’m moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\nOh shit, there’s no way Morgan still finds any of this interesting. Better change the subject, fast.\n",

    "passage": "They Were Friends Once [RF]\n\nThey were friends once, these two. A twenty-something man and a slightly younger twenty-something woman. As many friends do, they met at work. That first morning she walked in wearing formal office attire and carrying a bag full of paperwork, he thought her beautiful. Incredibly so, in fact. \n\nShe was married, of course. How could she not be? A woman like her, smart and beautiful? He was married as well, but his situation was more complicated. So while she might have thought of him as attractive, she thought of herself as off limits. But this was not to stop a friendship that blossomed as quickly as the spring flowers. \n\nThey did everything together at work. They would sit for hours chatting, sometimes even about work. They attended meetings together and she would make silly faces at him. They went to training classes together, and would sit in the back of the room and banter back and forth via little notes on handouts. They were virtually inseparable. And as he got to know her, he began to wish that she were his wife, rather than that woman who ran off to live with her college boyfriend. If she though the same, he didn’t know. But he thought sometimes that she did. Just by the way she occasionally looked at him. By the way she often dressed and by the perfume she wore. \n\nSocially, they didn’t do nearly as much, but occasionally. Sometimes he would go with her and her husband and see movies or go to dinner. Sometimes, they’d be at a co-worker’s house sampling wines. \n\nShe knew him almost better than she knew her husband, and he certainly thought he knew her better than he thought he knew his wife. For six months, they thought themselves as best friends. It is sad to say that the deep bond they developed over work was not deep enough. The friendship, inexplicably, withered and died in but an instant; a terrible instant they both wish had never happened. But it did, and there was no turning back. \n\nAnd it happened; over something silly no less. He offered her a suggestion, and she reacted as a child. He simply turned around and said no more of it. She later apologized, but their relationship seemed to be dead to her. They rarely talked after that, and though he wanted to speak to her, he didn’t know how she’d take it. So he didn’t. He didn’t say anything. Nor did she. He never knew what she was thinking, and she didn’t help him with it at all. \n\nLater, his wife came back. She swore she’d never do it again, but she did a few years later. But that’s for another time. He and his wife attended a party, and she was there with her husband. It was in the dead of winter, and the host had a hot tub. They all took part in some alcohol and spent the night relaxing in the warm water. He was hesitant at first, but the women, including his wife but perhaps more importantly including his old friend, his old, beautiful friend, convinced him to join them. So he did. She was drunk, and was happy and smiling at him. She was flirty and took pleasure in his presence. He took pleasure in hers as well, and greatly enjoyed watching her lithe form exit and enter the water in her white bikini so as to get more drinks. His wife didn’t approve, because he had confessed to her that he had a bit of a thing for her when she was gone. But he had a great time with his old friend. And his wife didn’t say much, because she knew she had given up the moral high ground. She lived with another man, after all, so she really couldn’t disapprove of his amorous feelings for another woman while she was away.\n\nHe went back to work the following Monday feeling invigorated. But he was disappointed to find that she pretended not to remember those long hours in the hot waters. She didn’t even acknowledge him. And so slogged the weeks and months until one day he took another job. He left without saying good bye, and she didn’t seem to care.\n\nYears went by, and he sometimes asked old associates about her. Slyly, so that none would think anything inappropriate took place. Her treatment of him was common knowledge, and it didn’t impress some folks, and he didn’t want them to think that he cared about her. But he did, and so he asked. Once he sent her an email. A friendly email asking how she was and apologizing for their falling out. He wanted her to know that he valued their friendship. She never replied. \n\nMore years went by, and his wife again lost her way and left. He took another job so as to escape his life, which was a disaster. He still worked in the same field, and occasionally thought about his old friend. He wondered if she ever thought about him. He doubted it. He hoped that someday, he’d see her again. Once he thought he did. A woman who looked just like her walked down the street. It wasn’t her, of course. \n\nEventually, he stopped thinking about her at all. And as it would happen, that’s when she made her appearance back in his life. It was at a conference. He saw her from across the room and she saw him. He thought he saw her eyes light up and a smile threaten to overtake her, but she turned back to the man she was talking to and ignored her old friend. Later, he met her in an elevator and attempted small talk. She insisted on one word answers until he mentioned that he just found out that he was supposed to drive another member of the convention to a town about three hours away for another meeting, but he didn’t know who. She looked shocked, and said I’m the one who is supposed to go. He couldn’t tell if she was pleasantly surprised or simply mortified. But she looked just as good as the day he first saw her, and he chanced to tell her so. At this she smiled, and said thank you.\n\nThey met at the entrance to the convention center and he walked her to the car. It was a cloudy, cold day, and she wore a light jacket. He took her bags and placed them in the trunk along with his. They drove and made small talk. She didn’t open up to him much, but he tried. Halfway to their destination, they drove into a blizzard, and he had to pull off the highway. He said we should get a couple of rooms and make the rest of the drive in the morning when the roads were cleared and to this she agreed. The motel clerk informed them that he had only one room available, and it was a single bed. He looked at her and said I’ll sleep on the floor and she said okay and they took the room. \n\nThe room was small and not very cozy since the heater blew only slightly warm air. He called to complain but the man only apologized. He did offer to bring extra blankets, and this he did. She went into the bathroom and locked the door and he heard the shower running. He found something on TV, and dozed on the bed. She came out wearing only a towel, which was too small for her long frame and it showed the bottom of her buttocks. She apologized and quickly grabbed her bag, taking care to bend down at the knee rather than at the waist and went back into the bathroom.\n\nShe came out a few minutes later wearing a white button up shirt that fell past her butt and, he assumed, panties of some sort. She again said sorry and then said I didn’t pack night clothes suitable for company. He said oh yeah and she said I sleep naked in hotels because I like the feel of the sheets. To this he smiled and they laughed together. The important thing, as far as he was concerned, was that she too smiled. \n\nHe moved his blankets to the floor and he went to lie down and she said we can stay up and watch some TV, it’s still early. He said okay and she said you can sit on the bed if you want. He said okay and he did. She sat down too and he tried not to look at her shapely thighs while she pretended not to notice. After a time she said you don’t mind if I smoke do you and he said no. Then she said remember that time when we went on that trip to DC and you me and Christie smoked in that club and he said yes I remember and they laughed because they knew that she and Christie didn’t smoke. Or not officially anyway. The girls swore him to secrecy and he kept their little secret. He thought she looked sexy smoking that day, and to his surprise, she looked even sexier in the bed, smoking and wearing a white button up shirt. She offered him one and he took it and they smoked together and watched TV. \n\nEventually she stretched out and got under the covers and he took this as his queue and he got up to sleep on the floor. He went into the bathroom and put on his shorts and came back out and made his bed and she rolled over towards him and smiled at him and he smiled back. She said I missed you and he said I missed you too and he turned out the light and tried to go to sleep. But he couldn’t. \n\nMinutes passed by in a time that seemed like hours and she said hey, to which he said what. She said heat rises and it’s probably cold on the floor. He said yes that’s true but I’ll be fine. And she said why don’t you sleep up here, it’s a queen sized bed and there’s room enough for both of us. He said do you think that’s a good idea and she said sure we won’t touch. So he got up in the dark and crawled onto the bed and brought his blanket and covered up. \n\nHer breathing evened out and he thought she was asleep. She wasn’t. She said, it would be warmer if you got under my covers and he said okay and hoped he didn’t sound anxious. She was a married woman and he thought that maybe this wasn’t appropriate. But he crawled under the covers and he nearly fell asleep when she touched his shoulder with her hand and his eyes jumped open. She said he left me and he said nothing in return for a long time and could only feel her warm hand on his skin. He said she left me again too and he rolled towards her and he could feel her breath on his face for she had moved closer to him. In the dim light he could see her face and could see that her eyes were open. She smiled at him and could see her white teeth. He smiled back. She said I’m sorry she left and he said I’m sorry he left. And she closed her eyes and he closed his. But his wouldn’t stay closed and his heart was pounding and he said in a rush I loved you and her eyes opened up and she smiled again and said I know. And she looked at him for a long moment and finally she said I loved you too. She moved towards him with quickness and he wrapped her up in his arms and he could feel her warmth and she could feel his and they slept. \n\nWhen they woke they were friends again. And maybe they were more.\n",

    "passage": "Who Loves You (song)\n\n“WHO LOVES YOU” is the title song of a 1975 album by The Four Seasons. It was composed by Bob Gaudio and Judy Parker and produced by Gaudio. It reached number 3 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100 in November 1975.[1][2][3]\n\n\nSong information\n\nAfter their release from Philips, the group signed with Motown and released one album and three singles for the organization in 1972 and 1973. All Motown recordings failed to chart in the U.S. and the company dropped the band.[4] In August, “Who Loves You” entered the Hot 100 as Frankie Valli's “Swearin' to God” was sliding off the chart. This was the final Four Seasons hit featuring bassist and backing vocalist Joe Long.[5][6]\n\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Chart (1975-76)                   | Peak                              |\n|                                   | position                          |\n+===================================+===================================+\n| Australia (KMR)                   | 16                                |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Canada _RPM_ Top Singles[7]*      | ≥ 20                              |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Canada _RPM_ Adult                | ≥ 12                              |\n| Contemporary[8]*                  |                                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n|                                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| New Zealand (RIANZ)[9]            | 22                                |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| South Africa (Springbok           | 13                                |\n| Radio)[10]                        |                                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| UK (OCC)                          | 6                                 |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| US _Billboard_ Hot 100[11]        | 3                                 |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| US _Billboard_ Adult              | 7                                 |\n| Contemporary[12]                  |                                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| US _Cash Box_ Top 100[13]         | 7                                 |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\nYear-end charts\n\n  Chart (1975)                            Rank\n  --------------------------------------- ------\n  Canada _RPM_ Top Singles[14]            70\n  US (Joel Whitburn's _Pop Annual_)[15]   44\n\n(* - Canadian _RPM_ chart data incomplete for late 1975)\n\n\nOther versions\n\nThere were three versions of “Who Loves You” released in the United States: the one on the _Who Loves You_ album is four minutes, 20 seconds long and begins with a short percussion section before the start of the vocals.[16] The A-side of the single has a 4-minute 4 second version which starts with an unusual “fade-in” beginning, starting with the first word of the lyrics; the B-side (labeled “Who Loves You (disco version)”) is the same as the A-side, with the instrumental break done twice and the song running 5:28.[17]\n\nAlthough the Four Seasons' trademark falsetto is present on “Who Loves You”, Valli's vocal performance on the recording is limited to singing lead on the verses.[18]\n\nFor a record from a group so long without any hit records, “Who Loves You” was a tremendous success. Released in August 1975, the single spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 (longer than any Four Seasons single before) and managed to stay on the chart until the beginning of 1976.[19]\n\nThis song was edited heavily and included as the closing number for the musical _Jersey Boys_. The second verse and instrumental break is completely omitted, and instead of the fade out, a loud, high-pitched ending chord is sung by the full company.

    "passage": "My Shameful Affliction.\n\nDeath.\n\nIt was all around me. Down the corridors in the rooms. The smell lingered like a black, hazy cloud above my head. The corridors were sickly white from the lights watching above, hurting my eyes as if somehow malicious and malevolent. Cautiously, I walked down the corridor; the sound of my heels clicking against the floor, echoing in my mind like the beats of people’s hearts around me.\n\nI leap. At least a foot or two in my mind, though it may have just been two inches. My heart skips, delaying my breath, and when it does come, it is in gasps and pants.\n\nA bloodcurdling scream had just emanated from one of the many cold, clinical walls, echoing down the corridor. I sigh, “Just another day at the offices I suppose”.\n\nI’m a nurse at the local hospital in the intensive care unit. Just an average person, there’s nothing different about me. At least, this is what I lead people to believe. I have a secret to hide, that nobody knows.\n\nThe hospital is the safest place for me to hide.\n\nNobody ever thinks it’s me. I mean, I’m a doctor - why would you suspect someone like me? You see, if I told you my secret right now, you would go cold. Your blood would freeze. You’d try your best to escape the crazy person that just told you this horrible, crazy thing. That’s what happened to last person I told.\n\nMy own mother, terrified, started screaming and shouting at me, telling me I’m a monster and that she never wants to see me again. Reluctantly I left, feeling rejected and downtrodden. I’m no stranger to rejection; I’ve always been cast out of groups, always been ignored.\n\nThat is, until I met him.\n\nAs I continued my journey down the corridor, I heard another scream; the same freezing sensation goes running down my spine exactly like before, reaching into my heart, replacing my blood with ice, pulling my air out of my body. I sigh, and after pausing for a precious moment, press onwards with my duty.\n\nI walked into the rooms around me, checking on the patients - but I have a specific patient on my mind. Calmly, I stroll out of the penultimate room, down to the last room at the end of the corridor. Drawn to it I quicken my pace, desperation setting in like the jaws of a vice, holding me in its grip. Something about it tempts me, there is something just so unusually tantalizing about it.\n\nI am the moth, and this is my flame.\n\nCarefully, I placed my hand upon the doorknob and paused for a moment, reflecting briefly on the events that had led to this moment. I smile to myself. “Time to go,” I whisper, and turn the doorknob, slowly and deliberately, quiet as a cat would tread down this hall. I push slightly on the door. It obeys, and opens without a sound, revealing its secrets.\n\nThere he lay, helpless, the pain creeping up on his face, contorting his usual handsome features into something completely different. He now was a catalyst of pain and anguish. His cheery demeanor had been replaced with a forlorn, defeated expression that I could feel myself mimicking from just looking at him.\n\nIt killed me to see him that way - something I’d never felt for anyone before it had all happened. The pale skin on his chest gently rose with his every breath. His bed ridden hair spread messily over his pillow like waves of some brown ocean, once luxurious now resembled rotten straw. Those mesmerizing ocean blue eyes that always kept me hypnotised in my place now repelled me, even though they weren’t open. Under his paper white skin, I could see his blood pumping faintly through his veins. I breathe in, taking in his scent. The smell intoxicates my mind, making my head spin around and around, my world suddenly becoming very cloudy. My every thought spiraling out of control, but all centering on him. His scent. His blood.\n\nSnapping out of my trance, I then realised how close I was to his neck. I pull back, ashamedly and race out of the room, making sure to leave no trace of my foul presence.\n\nThis turn of events had been recurring without relent for weeks now, ever since he was first admitted into this place. Ever since the start, something about him had hypnotised my every sense. Try as I may to avoid his room - even the very corridor it was situated in - it still seemed to end in the same horrible fashion. My face only inches from his neck.\n\nThis story isn’t unique though - this same tragic turn of events has happened to me once before, a long time ago. I used to work night shifts at another hospital before this one; and just like this very moment I was checking on patients to see if everything was ok.\n\nThere was one patient who stood out to me in a big way. His name was Gustav Wood. He was vastly different to all the others, and just like the current object of my desires, some unidentifiable thing about him stood out. Maybe it was his velvety smooth skin, how magically pale it was or the way his voice sounded, like a glass full of warm, creamy chocolate. I didn’t know what it was, but something about him intrigued me, and I had to find out what it was even if it killed me. \n\nGustav and I bonded quickly and graciously over the months of his stay at the hospital. We talked enthusiastically whenever I was treating him and checking in on him, and I found out a lot of things about him. He was a solider and got injured badly in the war. I nursed him from almost certain death - when he first came in I honestly thought he wasn’t going to make it and he was all I could think about throughout all my waking (and sleeping) hours.\n\nOne miserable night, when the rain was pouring angrily down, with the fog hanging thickly in the night sky, I went to check on Gustav. I walked into his room, quietly, so as not to wake him if he indeed was asleep. He turned around as briskly as I had entered and looked at me, but something about him seemed to be different. Something seemed wrong. I ignored that thought in the back of my head, continuing to get closer to him.\n\nGingerly, I stood beside his bed. Gustav gazed up at me with that strange look in his eyes, the same one I have been seeing for a few nights now. This look made me feel uneasy. This look was wrong. But before I could speak to him, or even open my mouth to try to speak, I noticed his eyes had taken an unusual form, and a devilish grin was forming on his lips.\n\nIt all just happened so fast. He grabbed me at the back of my head fiercely, and threw it back with enormous strength - strength I would never have expected from a recovering war casualty. My eyes opened wide, my mouth wider, and as I was just about to scream, he sank his teeth deep into my neck. My festering scream then released itself from my lungs, as he drained the life from my body. And as suddenly as he had started, he stopped, dropping my limp body on the bed and vanishing through the window into the darkness of the night.\n\nI laid there, withering in pain on the blood splattered sheets, the pain unreal like my body was being incinerated by the forces of Hell itself. Finally, the pain subsided and I woke up. A week had passed, and I was laid in the same place I was viciously attacked by Gustav. And I couldn’t place it, but something was very different about me. Something had changed in me; whether Gustav had provoked this change or it had happened itself I didn’t know. But I know now.\n\nTonight wasn’t any different to the other nights earlier in the week. I was doing the night shift again, checking in on each patient meticulously like every other night at the hospital. Once again, I had arrived at the end of the corridor. I had arrived near him. Cautiously, I opened the door, careful not to make a sound, then swiftly, gracefully entered - shutting it behind me. Then silently, coolly, walked towards him.\n\nHe was sound asleep. “Not for long,” I think, “Tonight’s the nights when my plan comes into action.” Cunningly, I put my face near his neck, his blood tantalisingly pulsating under his skin. Out of nowhere there was a noise outside the room. I stopped dead in my tracks and listen.\n\nSilence.\n\nSlowly, I opened my mouth, moved carefully over to his neck and sank my teeth in deep. He woke up immediately of course - much to my dismay - and screamed out in pain. I quickly clamp my hand over his mouth to muffle his irritating screams. The taste of blood in the back of my mouth was amazing, like nothing I had ever tasted before.\n\nI don’t know how long I was there, but eventually I stopped, dropping his limp body to the bed. I gazed down to my blood splattered shirt, to his lifeless, limp body and smile to myself.\n\n“Wow,” I sigh to myself, reveling in delight when all of a sudden a loud bang sounds outside; I get up from the bed immediately and jump through the window into the darkness, taking with me my conflicting feelings of ecstasy, guilt, but most of all – satiety.\n",

    "passage": "[RF] I Suppose\n\n**Tone, Voice, Style, Story: Feedback would be very much appreciated.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suppose it started when I first heard her name. For a thing begins much before the actuality in the imagining and the presupposing and building up in the brain of what it could be.\n\nMadison.\n\nIt was a pretty name.\n\n\nAt the time I was living in a small one-bedroom apartment on the fringes of the notoriously crime ridden Earen Street. Notorious may be too harsh a word but it was well known as a place where sadists and tourists alike often visited, although only quickly, and then after left quicker still. The houses were small and laboriously neglected; the front lawns of every household were little more than whispers of dying grass and dirt and old cars that would never run again. The rent was cheap and I was rather poor and had little of value so I didn’t fear being robbed as much as I should. The last of my luck was spent on that hope. Honestly, I didn’t mind the surroundings (not even the blue-red flashing lights that almost nightly pattered across my window). I worked for a local bakery; earned only enough to immediately spend or spent as much as I earned; I was never sure which but had little money either way. I had just moved to the City having pushed east towards the coast from the rugged, sparsely populated bushland that dominated most of the state, looking for work, looking to carve a life for myself and deny the hapless, soft fool I had once been. \n\nThese facts are rudimentary to a brisk, autumnal Saturday afternoon as I made my way home after an arduous shift at the bakery. The evening was chasing the cusp of night and the sun hung low over the blocky City horizon. I walked and enjoyed the cool weather, letting the ache of sustained concentration seep from my body. But as I neared the junction of Earen Street a man appeared along the footpath. He was half-hidden by the twilight gloom of the evening but his shady, dishevelled silhouette cut a menacing figure. Missing a shoe, his shirt half torn, the beast hobbled towards me. As he approached I could sense the tension that like a disease infected the air around him. I paused and he pushed on past me, a desperate gleam to his wet eyes. And then he started to yell loudly and frantically a single word:\n\n“Madison!”\n\nI thought nothing of it at the time. \n\nI liked to go out on weekends; head deeper into the City in pursuit of the bustling nightlife that was so alien and so strange and so alive and nothing like I had ever experienced in the almost-savage outback. It demanded inebriation and I, the willing sacrifice, spent many early mornings dancing, drinking, smoking and vomiting amid the swirl of civility that could expect nothing less. That’s where I met her. She was outside a small pub called Samson’s that was situated between two larger clubs and was a favourite resting place among those who knew it. She leant against a tall neon lit streetlamp, cigarette burning short between her lips.  Her hair was toned twice between differing shades of blonde and her eyes, like gems, shone a piercing blue. She smiled easily. Her small, round face was very pretty. Her lips were full and red. As I stumbled towards Samson’s, giddy from having just avoided a raucous and completely unnecessary but somehow integral fistfight at one of the clubs I caught her eye and grinned.\n\n“You look like shit.” she said as I neared her. It was an honest statement.\n\n“Thank you… you look.. like a sunrise.” I was liquored-up and she laughed to spite me. Undeterred, I asked for a cigarette and she happily complied.\n\n“I’m Sam, by the way.”\n\n“I’m Madison.”\n\nSomething moved at the fringes of my blurred recognition then as I lit the smoke and took a drag but I pushed it away.\n\n“Where are you heading tonight?” I asked.\n\n“Nowhere in particular, you?”\n\n“By my lonesome tonight.”\n\n“You aren’t a crazy loner creep are you?”\n\n“I suppose I am.” I conceded.\n\n“Well at least you’re honest about it.”\n\n“If anything, I am honest. What about you? What are you if nothing else?”\n\n“Probably crazy.” her smile was devilish.\n\n“Well, crazy and lonely. We’d make a good villain.”\n\n“You can tag along with me, if you like.” \n\nWe did that modern manoeuvre of exchanging numbers then I stubbed out my cigarette and went in search of a celebratory drink. I remember having one final swig of some sticky sweet mixed spirit before collapsing to the ground unconscious. I awoke the next morning upon the front step of my apartment. \n\n\nThe week that followed passed slowly and uneventfully. I thought quite a bit of Madison in the quieter moments and many times I considered calling or texting her on the number she had given me. But somehow, I didn’t. I suppose I feared substantiality.\nYet, despite myself I did visit Samson’s every afternoon hoping that we could by chance (because chance is the one thing that could supersede denial) meet again but Madison didn’t return and the food was bland and overpriced. And the days passed on as normal. She plagued my mind, though, and it was uncomfortable the amount of time I spent thinking about her; but it was good and fun when I gave into it. I conjured up images of her ruining men; of flitting from one to the other as she was fawned upon and beseeched for attention. Somehow, she was pure in even that. That is how I saw her and over the long week she became known to me like one knows an old acquaintance: with absurd familiarity. \n\n\nAnother day of work passed and later, as I lay in bed that night having called home and let them know that I was okay, and after congratulating my younger brother on his fourteenth birthday, having tidied my small apartment and given in to the temptation of fast food I retreated to comfort. \nI was accompanied by thoughts of her again. She was truly pretty; one of those girls that men look upon and think immediately of matrimony and children and a comfortable life of three meals, of white-picketed fences and the blissful slipping into age and happy unrequired but partnered existence that follows. I held my phone in my hands, turning it slowly, considering what I’d say if I did call her, how, when and if I truly wanted to at all. Just as my nerves started to berate my conscious I stood, half dressed and retrieved the packet of smokes from above my fridge that I kept for emergencies. I cracked open the front door and stood in the frame, taking long, slow drags of the pleasurable toxin as I looked out upon the lamp lit street. Dogs barked not too far away, and cars continued to roll past in semi-regular intervals. The sky above was starless and black and the verdant smell of rain was carried upon a slight breeze. I finished a smoke but as Madison still complemented my thoughts: lit another.\nI watched the night unfold upon the urban sprawl and then i spotted, in the distance someone running up the street along the path across from my apartment. It wasn’t particularly alarming; having lived along Earen Street for the last few months such sights became almost common occurrences. But then my heart flew into my throat. The figure stopped under one light and for a moment became fully, intricately visible. \n\nIt was Madison.\n\nShe was wearing a hoody and denim jeans; her hair tucked up in a half bundle but her eyes, those gem-like blue eyes, shone with a neon glare that my imagination had deified. Without thinking I breathed her name, and then shouted it down the street. Her head spun around and she locked eyes with me.\n\n“It’s Sam.” I clarified with a wave, stepping into the light, “We met  last week. I owe you a smoke, don’t I?”\n\nShe was tense as she walked over to me.\n\n“I could use a coffee.” she suggested, glancing over her shoulder nervously.\n\nI let her into my apartment and closed the door. As soon as my front door clicked shut behind her, Madison began to relax. I put the kettle on to boil and offered her a seat and something to eat.\n\n“Thanks, Sam, right?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“You disappeared that night, if I remember.”\n\nI blushed: “Drank a little too much.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow and smiled. I noticed that she carried herself with a particular certainty; one borne of stolen youth and sudden, violent maturity. She reminded me of a stray cat in a way; so unlike that which I had envisaged. But it wasn’t an unpleasant realisation. Her lips too were less vivid, and her eyes more wild. I started to pour us each a hot mug of coffee. \n\n“So, what makes you come to Earen Street on a night like this?” I asked, jesting.\n\n“My ex-boyfriend lives nearby.”\n\nI froze, mid-pour of measured cup. It occurred to me that this had happened before and I had been a second too late; discovering the boyfriend, a mess, moving down the street with desperation. My confidence taunted me; would i be next? I almost glanced out the window, expecting to see the same crazed eyes staring back; his or mine.\n“We broke up not long ago,” she explained, “but I hoped we could work it out. Apparently, we can’t.”\n\nI smiled as the memory flashed, and faded, and was then forgotten. But the seconds dragged on and I have always been terrible at small talk. I had been raised to speak plainly and honestly and, although infinitely useful for a mother to rein in her child, it was a curse to my adult self.\n\n“He was probably a dick.” I said gruffly and she smiled.\nAnd then we started to talk. We spoke of the places we grew up, of why we moved to The City and how, of what we were planning on in the future as well as now. It was an easy conversation filled with longwinded explanations synonymous with comfortable friendship but soon the weight of time started to press upon us and we realised it was closing on midnight.\n\n“You’re a good guy, Sam.” said Madison.\n\nShe moved closer.\n\n“You’re wonderful.” I said.\n\nShe moved closer still.\n\nAnd then our lips were pressed against each other’s and her breath tasted of coffee and sugar and something bitter like blood. She pressed herself onto me and we found our way to my bedroom. Leaning heavily into each other; smothered in embrace. She took off her hoody and then her shirt. Her breasts were small and pale in the half-light that spilled through the window, her nipples erect. I undressed quickly.\nIt was quick and loud and awkward at first but soon we fell away from each other sweaty and tired. Madison fell asleep almost immediately after and I leant over and kissed her lightly on the forehead. She looked so beautiful then. I pressed my nose into the back of her neck and slept. \n\n\nThe next day she left early and without saying much. \nAnd I saw her never again.",

He decided that the convert, whom we will call “Sarah,” had become a Jew under “false Pretext [sic].” Rabbi Tropper informed Sarah’s husband, “Avraham,” that his wife’s conversion had been registered as nullified with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and that the child produced by their marriage would not be regarded as Jewish, either. Finally, Rabbi Tropper declared that it was “forbidden” for Avraham to be married to Sarah. “Even if she decides to become observant,” Rabbi Tropper wrote via email, “she will need a new conversion,” and the couple would require a “new halachic marriage.” What happens if despite a rabbi’s best due diligence, a convert to Orthodox Judaism doesn't keep Jewish law for the long haul? If that convert begins eating cheeseburgers and driving on Shabbat? Does the conversion remain valid? Is a convert 100% Jewish no matter what? Historically, a lapsed convert was still considered a Jew unless those lapses were immediate to the conversion, public, and intentional. The convert had to know what he was about to do was wrong, and then had to do it anyway. (Before the 19th century and the advent of ultra-Orthodoxy, according to Zvi Zohar, an Israeli scholar who studies this issue, there is no evidence a rabbi ever revoked a conversion for any reason.)\n\nTimes have changed. That’s because haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jews like Leib Tropper, founder and director of Eternal Jewish Family—an organization dedicated to converting non-Jewish spouses of intermarried Jews—represent the most rapidly growing demographic in Judaism. Tropper also founded and runs a yeshiva in Monsey, New York, and travels regularly to Israel, where he frequents the halls of haredi power and hobnobs with its leaders. People like him are the Jewish future. They’re at the center of a seemingly irrevocable schism between Orthodoxy and every other denomination of Judaism. They're determined to restrict and to monitor all Orthodox conversions as part of their spiritual war against non-haredi Judaism, and they want nothing less than ultimately to define who is a Jew. Tropper did not revoke Sarah’s conversion because she bowed down to idols, accepted Jesus as her Lord and Savior, or identified with the atheist philosophies of Christopher Hitchens. She didn’t renounce any universally accepted tenet of Judaism. Sarah’s conversion was ruled invalid because she did what many Modern Orthodox women do every day: get dressed and go out of the house. Sarah’s conversion was reversed because Tropper heard that she had worn pants, and occasionally—only when shopping outside the Jewish neighborhood—she had left her hair uncovered. Sarah and Avraham live hundreds of miles from Tropper, who is based in the ultra-Orthodox enclave of Monsey, New York. How did Tropper find out about Sarah’s clothing? Easy: Her husband told him.\n\nA “_baal teshuva_,” Avraham was as new to ultra-Orthodoxy as Sarah was to Judaism. Like many people who become Orthodox as adults, he had questions. Orthodox Jewish law mandates how to put on and tie one’s shoes; when, how, and even if to have sex; what and when to eat, and hundreds of other daily minutiae. Was it a major transgression for Sarah occasionally not to cover her hair? What about wearing pants?\n\nAvraham didn’t know, so he asked Tropper, who said that her behavior showed a flagrant disregard for Judaism, and that she was taking Jewish law lightly. He questioned Sarah’s original intent in converting, and contacted her for an explanation. Shocked that her husband had gone behind her back, Sarah refused to talk, and Tropper revoked her conversion. In an email to Avraham, Tropper wrote, “We must keep our word. [Sarah] ACCEPTED on herself to OBSERVE ALL of the torah & rabbinical commanments [sic]. She never did. You know that & you told me that.”\n[] IN LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY, Tropper wreaked havoc on another family of seekers. Leah Bourne's maternal grandmother was Jewish, so according to Jewish law she was as well, but she hadn’t been raised that way. Her husband Peter wasn’t Jewish at all. After marrying and having children, the Bournes became involved with a Reform synagogue, but they wanted more. Along with their 16-year-old son Jonathan, they attended an EJF information seminar in their town. Raised in the Bible Belt, the Bournes were attracted to Tropper’s Jewish fundamentalism. They invested in the expensive process of koshering their home, kept the Sabbath, and studied Torah. They were a model family—so much so that EJF featured them in its promotional video. Tropper even convinced Jonathan, then a junior in high school, to forsake his senior year and enroll at Kol Yaakov, Topper’s Monsey-based yeshiva for Baal Teshuva students. Though at first his parents didn't agree with their son missing his senior year of high school, Tropper assured them that Jonathan would be able to learn Torah and get his GED at the same time. As they delved deeper into ultra-Orthodoxy, the Bournes were intrigued by the idea of their son becoming a learned Jew, and perhaps even a rabbi. Jonathan moved to Monsey, where he spent his days studying. Peter, meanwhile, worked toward converting by learning Torah over the phone with a Monsey rabbi. Peter’s teacher happened to work at Tropper’s yeshiva, and kept the proud father informed about Jonathan’s progress. The reports were very good: Jonathan was a diligent, budding scholar. Tropper promised the Bourne family that he’d send a rabbi to open a synagogue and build a mikvah in Lexington. Having an Orthodox synagogue and mikvah in their town was essential because EJF will not authorize conversions for people who live in areas without an acceptable Orthodox infrastructure. Unable to relocate, the Bournes depended on Tropper’s guarantees. Eventually, Leah and Peter traveled to Monsey for an EJF seminar. Leah, who has an architecture degree, was shocked by what she found. In her words, Kol Yaakov was “unfit for human habitation.” It was dirty, unkempt, and unsafe. She saw students living in overcrowded basement rooms without egress windows or other safe exits. According to Leah, “What pathetic stuff they had down in that basement to serve as a kitchen and dining room were disgustingly filthy, neglected, and inadequate for the number of boys living there.…They were not provided with breakfast (except maybe some day-old or stale pastries from a local bakery) or lunch, and for dinner they were divided up and sent around to other people’s homes every night—not just for Shabbat.” Leah was amazed that in light of all this, Tropper had helped find Jonathan a black hat and suit. “Clearly, the clothes were far more important to Tropper than making sure they had food.”\n[] Just as Sarah’s clothes were more important to Tropper than the radical life change she’d made in embracing Orthodox Judaism, and just as her uncovered hair was more important to Tropper than her relationship with her husband, Jonathan Bourne’s black hat was prioritized over his health, his personal safety—and his education. There was no GED program available at Kol Yaakov, and when Jonathan began to ask questions, Tropper’s response was to chastise him for not finding an outside program to enroll in. As Peter was completing the requirements for his conversion, Tropper presented the family with a major setback: There would be no synagogue or mikvah in Lexington. Peter was instructed to abandon his job and future pension, and move his family to Monsey. When Tropper’s nebulous offers to help Peter find a job there weren’t enough to quell the Bournes’ anger and disappointment, Tropper—who refused to comment for this story—expelled Jonathan from Kol Yaakov without notice, dumping him on the street. IN ISRAEL, THE ONLY government recognized conversions are Orthodox. Last year, Israeli Rabbi Avraham Atia—a government-empowered haredi rabbinic judge based in Ashdod—retroactively annulled a woman’s conversion to Judaism that had been performed by Conversion Authority head Rabbi Haim Druckman fifteen years before. The nine-page legal decision by Atia could be understood to invalidate thousands of conversions performed by Druckman, a Religious Zionist rabbi, and the rabbis with whom he’s worked over the years. This reading of Rabbi Atia’s ruling was adopted by the Chief Rabbinate’s High Rabbinic Court, which heard the Atia case on appeal. In a fifty-five page ruling released in early May of this year, the lead rabbinic judge—another haredi rabbi, Avraham Sherman—ruled every conversion performed by Rabbi Druckman from 1999 onward invalid. Thousands of converts and their children are now deemed “goyyim,” their marriages void, their relationships with their spouses now “illicit.” While Israel’s Modern Orthodox and National Religious rabbis invested their energy, time, and money into settling the West Bank and creating an ever-greater Israel, haredim used their resources to become the dominant Orthodox political force in the country—even as they remain ambivalent about the validity of a Jewish state. They took control of the country’s Chief Rabbinate and its entire bureaucracy, whose authority they now wield as a weapon to attack and delegitimize more moderate Orthodox rabbis in Israel and abroad.\n\nAmerica’s largest rabbinic group, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) which represents “Centrist” and Modern Orthodox rabbis, was negotiating with Israel’s Chief Rabbinate over the conversion issue when we spoke with its executive vice president, Rabbi Basil Herring, in January. The Chief Rabbinate wanted the RCA to set up formal “conversion courts” with American judges approved by the Chief Rabbinate, who would first travel to Israel to be “trained” by the Chief Rabbinate to “properly” supervise conversions. Herring described the RCA’s relationship with Israel’s Chief Rabbinate as “very warm and positive.” “And that includes [the subject of] conversion,” Rabbi Herring emphasized. He was unwilling to comment on specific cases that might disturb that idyll—such as Rabbi Atia’s conversion revocation—because, he claimed, he was not privy to the specific details of the case. But privy he would soon be. This spring, the RCA reached an agreement (labeled “capitulation” by critics, including at least one former RCA president) with Israel’s Chief Rabbinate ensuring that American conversions will be much stricter from now on, and will be done only through formal, pre-approved “conversion courts.\" On May 6, the RCA reacted with outrage to the High Rabbinic Court’s revocation of thousands of Modern Orthodox conversions:\n\n  “T]he RCA finds it necessary to state for the record that in our view the ruling itself, as well as the language and tone thereof, are entirely beyond the pale of acceptable halachic practice, violate numerous Torah laws regarding converts and their families, create a massive desecration of God's name, insult outstanding rabbinic leaders and halachic scholars in Israel, and are a reprehensible cause of widespread conflict and animosity within the Jewish people in Israel and beyond. The RCA is appalled that such a ruling has been issued…\n\nThe RCA also claimed it had been “assured” by Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar, the haredi president of the rabbinic court system, that the High Rabbinic Court ruling “directly countermanded his instructions and policies” and had “no legal standing at this time.” Reports in the Israeli media noted that Rabbi Amar was “trying” to annul the ruling.\n[] On May 11, the _Jerusalem Post_ reported that many of Israel’s marriage registrars—all Orthodox—are refusing to register marriages of converts until Amar clarifies the status of Sherman’s ruling. In a country without civil marriage and with no other recognized Jewish options, this leaves converts in a limbo that could continue indefinitely. Amar says he wants to have the Chief Rabbinate's governing council discuss the issue, but the council is not seated. Therefore, Amar plans to wait for elections to the council to be held. His spokesman claims to be unsure how long this might take. HAREDIM SEE ULTRA-ORTHODOXY as the only true Judaism. They don’t view non-Orthodox Judaism as a theological threat, because in their minds Reform, Conservative, and post-denominational Jews are only a few years from irrelevance. In the US, for every 1.36 children a Reform Jewish couple have, haredim have 6.72, and Modern Orthodox have 3.39.\n\nAlthough they still have Modern Orthodoxy to contend with, the reality is that haredim now control Israel’s Chief Rabbinate and rabbinic courts. They provide teachers for Modern Orthodox day schools, dominate Jewish outreach, and serve as rabbis in Modern Orthodox synagogues. Through control of the conversion process, haredim can determine who is a Jew, who is an Orthodox rabbi, and therefore what traditional Judaism is. The pawns in this haredi power play are the thousands of Orthodox Jewish converts who, just like Sarah, woke up one day to find they are no longer Jewish, their marriages are null and void, and their children are forbidden to marry Jews.\n",

    "passage": "We Don't Go to Ravenholm\n\nRavenholm. Once an old mining town, now a zombie infested wasteland. Ravenholm used to be a thriving mining town with great people long ago, and then later served as a stronghold for the Resistance. This stronghold managed to stay under the radar, but somehow the Combine found it. They didn’t do their usual “purge and sterilize” procedure, for this was to big a threat, they would have been outnumbered. No, instead of coming and fighting, they launched several headcrab mortars from a few towns over. The Resistance managed to stave off the headcrabs for a while, but eventually, their ranks were broken, infiltrated, and the headcrabs began gradually turning everyone into the monstrosities that we refer to as “zombies”. That was almost a year ago now, and the city is now a run down, heavily trapped, zombie infested nightmare. We have a phrase in the Resistance: “We don’t go to Ravenholm.” It’s not clever, witty, or comedic, it’s just simply a reminder of what happened and why we don’t go there, and even with all this, I’ve somehow managed to be convinced to go here by Alyx.\nAlyx Vance is one of the many leaders for the Resistance, she sent me here to find an “asset” that is critical to the Resistance; Gordon Freeman. Everybody has heard of Dr. Freeman, he was formerly a theoretical physicist at Black Mesa turned Resistance. He has helped us numerous times in battle, and he was like a machine; kill one Combine, move seamlessly to a zombie, then straight to an Antlion. I wondered where he received his combat training, considering he used to be a scientist right out of MIT, maybe he used to be military, who knows? He never says anything. Ever. Anyway here I am, sent to retrieve him, but I doubt he needs any help.\nMy name is Alexander Sauer; I joined the resistance about three years ago. When I was around twenty five, my brother was taken to Nova Prospekt in a Combine raid, after that, I swore to get my revenge, no matter what. I was contacted by the Resistance when Alyx Vance and Barney Calhoun were passing through City 7, they heard about the raid and said I could fight for the Resistance and get the Combine off of our planet. Naturally, I joined right away to get back at the Combine for what they did to my brother; I wouldn’t let them do this to anybody else.\nSo, here I am, in the middle of this sad parody of what used to be a town, looking for one scientist who is supposedly able to save the world.\nWhat a rut I have gotten myself into.\nI walked out of the abandon mineshaft that led straight from Black Mesa East to Ravenholm into an open grassy area boxed in by three or four buildings; it was hard to see in the dark. A small rustling sound came from my left. I swung my handgun up to meet the perpetrator, only to find it was a crow. The crow looked at me for a second, almost sizing me up, and then flew off into the night. “Strange.” I mumbled to myself. I started heading towards a small shack with a sickly yellow light radiating from it when I heard a second rustling sound behind me, this time much bigger. I brought my gun up again to defend myself from whatever was making the noise. I peered into the darkness with my gun drawn, but I couldn’t see anything. “Birds, I guess…” I put my gun back in its holster and turned around towards the shack when I bumped into a pair of dismembered legs hanging from a tree.\n“Dritt!” I swore in Norwegian, which was rare, I usually reserved that for special occasions. I stumbled backwards and tripped over a rock, falling down. My commotion had awakened a headcrab zombie from under the shack. I brought my gun up for a third time and put seven bullets in the things chest, which brought it down, but not for long. I made a b-line straight for the shack, leaping over the fallen monster and slamming the door behind me. I began taking mental inventory.\nI shot seven rounds, which leaves eleven more in the clip, plus my six other magazines. I also have my SMG if worst comes to worst.\nAfter making sure I was prepared, I checked around, looking at what the shack held. It looked like an old workshop of some kind, I saw old saw blades, propane tanks, and 2x4’s lying around. I began to wonder why a workshop would need propane, when I was interrupted by the gurgling cry that signifies a headcrab zombie. In a room I hadn’t bothered to look in, there were four or five zombies shambling towards me, thankfully there were boards nailed to the doorframe, but that wouldn’t hold them long. I began to draw my gun from my holster, when I had an idea. I returned my pistol to its home on my belt, and jogged over to the pile of propane tanks. I picked one up and, with much effort, threw it into the zombie filled room. It looked like somebody else had the same idea, because there were scorch marks on the wall. I unloaded three rounds into the tank in the middle of the room, and then dived for cover. There was a loud bang which left my ears ringing, but it took care of the zombies, so I wasn’t complaining. I vaulted over the boards and made sure the zombies were dead. I was surprised when I found the spent magazine of a pistol on the ground; it looked to be the same model as mine, which was Resistance standard issue. That told me two things; that somebody had already been through here, and recently because judging by the amount, or the lack thereof, of rust or dried blood on it. I thought to myself that it could have been Dr. Freeman, but then thought better.\nIt could be anybody’s magazine; it is what the Resistance gives out, after all. But what if…\nI shook this thought from my head. If there was one thing I learned over the years it would be: don’t get your hopes up, you will be disappointed. If you have low expectations, you will be easily impressed and happy with the way things turn out. Too many a time I have hoped that my brother would come back from Nova Prospekt, perfectly fine and healthy, but that day never came.\nAfter about three and a half hours of wandering around Ravenholm in the dark avoiding zombies and headcrabs alike, my eyelids began to feel heavy. I knew that I couldn’t just sleep anywhere here; almost every room, closet, and air duct was filled with all kinds of baddies. I had to find somewhere safe. Thirty minutes later, I was still looking for somewhere to rest my eyes, when some yellow paint caught my eye. I made my way over to inspect the paint, and what I saw reassured me that I was on the right track.\nWhat I saw was a spray paint lambda with a circle around it that signified a lambda cache. Lambda caches are small stores of weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies that Resistance members have strategically placed in safe havens in and around City 17. Seeing that sign gave me immense hope, it meant that I had somewhere safe for at least the night, and also that I could resupply my weapons. The only problem was that it was on a ledge about twelve feet off of the ground. I began to scan the surrounding area for ways to get my tired body up to this beacon of hope. I saw a ladder about five hundred meters away, but there was a large group of zombies surrounding it.\nUp till now, I have been mostly trying to avoid confrontation with the zombies by finding other routes around or quietly sneaking by. I whittled myself down to two options: either I would come up with a distraction and sneak by while they were busy, or I could take them head on. Conserving ammo wasn’t really a problem for me because there was a cache right after this, so I chose the latter of the two options. I decided to not take any chances and use my submachine gun this time. I pulled it around on its sling, and levelled it with the first zombie’s head. I pulled the trigger in two short, controlled bursts, so that I could keep accurate, while still putting a fair amount of lead into the former-human’s head. The short, loud reports of my gun awakened the other zombies while the first one fell to the ground. I took them down, one by one; controlled, almost machine like. In a situation such as this, I couldn’t afford to let my emotions, my thoughts, get in the way. I couldn’t let the fact that these things used to be normal people, sons, daughters, fathers, mothers… brothers… I hesitated for a second, lingering on this thought, and then my training brought me back to focus. I kept squeezing off shots until they were all gone, just in time too; my SMG was out of ammunition.\nI sprinted over to the ladder and climbed up onto the roof. I made my way, rooftop to rooftop, towards the Lambda Cache, and almost nothing popped out to protest my progression. I had made it to the hatch right above the Cache; I scanned around to make sure nothing was watching me, and slipped in silently. The Cache was a small area of air duct that had been welded off from the rest of the system to preserve security. It was around five feet by five feet wide, and three feet tall. I looked around, and my heart sank. What I saw was a mattress, some tally marks on the wall, and empty ammunition cases. All the ammo had been taken! Somebody had made it here before me, and my SMG was empty! I cursed myself for assuming that there would be an abundance of ammo here. I took inventory again, I had around three clips for my handgun, plus whatever I had in the gun, but that would only get me so far. I curled up on the mattress. I needed rest; I would be able to plan better with full tanks. I began to drift off to sleep, let a warm blanket of dark drift over my body.\nI had almost fallen completely asleep, when I heard a shuffling down one of the branches in the air duct. I saw one of the paths leading off wasn’t welded shut like the others, it looked as though somebody or something had broken through it with their bare hands, judging by the blood.\nHow had I not noticed that before? I need to keep my guard up, if I keep this up, I’m going to end up dead.\nI began to reach for my pistol, but it was nowhere to be found. I looked down the duct again, this time I flicked on my flashlight to see what was making the noise. The sight that greeted me was that of a severed torso from a headcrab zombie. I crawled over to the hatch leading out, but it would stop about a quarter of the way open. I tried to look for my handgun, but, still, it eluded my eyes. I began throwing my shoulder into the hatch, trying desperately to force it open. One, two, three, four. It my shirt ripped, and after around the sixth or seventh attempt, my shoulder began to bleed. It was no use, the torso was already at my feet, making its signature gurgling cry to alert the other zombies. I threw my shoulder at the door once more, putting all my weight behind it. It opened. I scrambled out and into the open air. It appeared the torso had succeeded in alerting the other zombies, this time, they were skinny corpses that moved at superhuman speed. I began running away along the rooftops. I jumped from rooftop to rooftop, trying to put as much distance between me and the zombies. I came to an extremely high drop, with no other rooftops in sight. I saw a water tower with an open top about fifty meters from the ledge and about ten down. I decided to leap for it, because I was dead anyway if I didn’t. I backed up until I thought I had enough room to gain sufficient speed. I sprinted up to the edge as fast as I could, and then I jumped.\n",

    "passage": "Richard\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOnce upon a time there was a retard.  I called him Richard.  Richard was the name of the person for the part he played.  He was fat and that smell of a shirt that was packed away in your grandpa’s basement for ten years, then worn by your father for a week straight camping, without showering, was the smell that lingered after he‘d sneak up on you from behind and put you in a head lock and give you a noogie.  \n\tHe mowed lawns all day and all summer long.  His suspender held up his blue jeans just past his bellybutton.  A creased, foamy, netted hat sat on the top of his head, tilted up.  His t-shirts were stained yellow under his armpits.  Sometimes he wouldn’t wear a hat and his head would be freshly shaved and bald on top.\n\tThe Tavern opened up at eleven, so if you worked lunch, the shifts began at ten.  Brew a pot of coffee.  Smoke a couple cigarettes.  Put on some music that you won’t be able to listen to when the seventy-year olds come in and ask you if you can pick out all the diced carrots in the chicken noodle soup.  Then, grab a stack of place mats and napkins and start setting the tables.  By the time you get to the silver ware, the other employees will start showing up.  Get the specials from the cook.  Write them on the board.  You’ll either have fifteen to spare or no time and that will depend on more than one variable.\n\tWhen then open sign is turned on, you won’t have much to do.  That is the time you should order food.\n\tAt twelve, the construction workers will file in-in groups of three.  Their big, steel-toed boots will leave trails of red clay and dirt all over the bar.  At this same time, you’ll see a bike roll up, with a trailer carrying a lawn mower.  This is Richard.  He balances his bike by putting one peddle at the lowest possible point.  Then his bike balances on the peddle at a eighty-five degree angle.  You’ll never see his bike tip over.\n\tAfter he gets off his bike, he hikes up his pants and stomps into the bar.  The back door swings open and everything freezes for a moment.  His head shifts from side to side to side to side.  And his eyes are an extension of his head.  He talks to a few regulars then there is at least six inches of fat between him and the bar .  I am hosting and serving and Chelsea is bartending.\n“Hey ah, Chelsea.”\nSays Richard.\n“Yes Richard.”\nResponds Chelsea.\n“Do you have any lunch specials my dear?”\n“Yes we do Richard.  We have a Reuben or a Chicken Salad Sandwich.”\n“Well then,  I guess I’ll take a burger, medium rare, with a few fries.”\n“Alright Richard.  I’ll send that right in.”\nSeeing there is fifteen minutes before his food will be ready, he walks over to me.\n“Stahl, what are you up to?”\n“Working hard Richard.”\nI’d take another drag off my cigarette and look into the lounge.  The lounge would be empty.\n“How about eighteen holes of golf?”\n“Sure Richard.”\nI’d hand him a few bucks and he’d get down on his knees and insert the money into the video game.  I wouldn’t always have the patience to play a game with Richard.  Sometimes I’d have work to do.  Or no money.  Then I’d suggest Chris as a partner.  Or Jay, who was my boss but he’d use the same excuse every time.\n“Can’t.  Hurt my hand.”\n\tOnce the money was in the machine, the music would begin playing and we would pick the color of our golfer.  At this moment, his eyes would widen and he’d have all the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas day.\n“Oh man, Stahl, I am going to kick your butt!”\nHe’d say.\n“Oh yeah?”\n“Yeah.”\nIf he'd have had to gone to sleep, he would of been staring at the ceiling all night long.\n\tWe would pick a course and begin playing.  Birdies were relatively easy to achieve.  Eagles were a bit more difficult.  And a hole in one was rare.  I didn’t want to beat him but I always did.  A birdie received a,\n“Tweet, tweet, tweet.”\nFrom Richard.\nAn eagle was louder, deep down in his throat and involved the flapping of his wings as if he were trying to fly away.  There was no signature sound for a hole in one.  I believe he’d  just yell real loud and give you a high five.\n“That calls for O’ Doul’s.  I’ll take two and double fist’em and get rowdy and go to work tomorrow at the store all red-eyed so Laurie says, ‘What the hell did you do last night?  And I'll say I was double fisting O' Doul's.’”\nRarely did he hint at drinking Jager.  Or about a time, when he’d be plastered, starting bar fights and grabbing woman’s breasts.  One year though, while working the party, at Arnie’s beach, pouring beers for everyone, he began pouring them for himself as well.  And no one noticed because they convinced him along time ago that  O’Doul’s has alcohol, which isn’t exactly a lie.\t\n\tUsually his food would be done before our round, then it would get cold.  When we finished, I would say,\n“Good game Richard.  What you up to now?”\n“Well, I already moved Carol’s lawn.  Now I have to go mow Jerry’s and Johnnie’s lawn.”\n“Work hard Richard.”\n\tLunch ended at three and dinner began at five.  Richard would be back at five.  He’d put his order in and see if he could get another eighteen holes in.  I’d tell him,\n“Once a day, Richard, once a day.”\nThen he’d ask a few others who would refuse his offer.  He’d ask me again and I’d say,\n“No.”\nOne more circle and try with me before he’d just start talking.\n“What have you been up to Stahl?”\n“Work and play, Richard.”\n“Well, are you working hard?”\n“Always do.”\nI’d go behind the bar and pour him a double, cherry coke with extra grenadine.  His eyes became dilated and wouldn’t focus.  (Although his eyes never really did focus.)  His laugh and talk became more nervous and furtive.  Overall, he’d become more jittery and bounce off the walls while talking to everyone.  You could see him walk up to a tourist couple.  Pull out his business card.  Put his arm around one of them and talk like he’s known them his whole life.  Then five minutes later, you see their minds turning, thinking is this guy normal.  I’d place the drink on the napkin.  His eyes would lighten up.\n“God you are the best, Stahl.”\n“Thanks Richard.”\n“No, thank you.  You know I love you because you’re crazy and we make it fun.”\n“I know.”\nHe’d slam his beverage in about seven seconds and I’d make him another.\n\tBy now it would be five fifteen.  You would go back and make sure no one had come to dine.  The restaurant would be empty.  Your fellow employees would be sitting on their asses.  It would be very motivating.  You could go have another cigarette, you could go read by the host desk, or you could go talk to Richard some more.  And that is what you’d do.  You would walk through the wait station, behind the front bar, back to the back bar and the only remnants would be an empty glass sitting on a soggy napkin.  You could look out the window and see his bike drifting slowly away.\n\tThe following day Richard would be in at the exact same time.  He would nearly say the exact same things.  And days would come  and months would go.  Tourists would visit and leave.  More tourists would visit and leave.  The island would freeze, then thaw and everyone would continue living like always, except Richard because, one hot and humid August day, when his lawn mower broke down and he thought his life was worthless, he took a twelve gauge and blam, blam, there was a big hole through his head.  He was a good man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "passage": "[SF] Robert\n\nChapter One\nSolution\n\n\nFocusing on his AIGAR, Meldon ignored the blistering cold, and continued on his scans. It was at negative-fifteen degrees inside the station, and no amount of thermal insulation could make him feel as though the warmth wasn't being sucked from his bones. \n\t“Why did I even want this posting?” he said begrudgingly. It was times like these that he hated his career choice. Isolated, cold, and worst of all, bored. Meldon had seen all the vids, listened to all the music, and reread every piece of literature that was on the station, and he was dying of boredom. Occasionally, he'd try the coms, in hopes of maybe raising someone on Terra-7, the closest space station, but gamma rays and radiation frequently disrupted any form of communication. He was nearly 4.2 light years away from Home, Earth. Proxima Centuri was the furthest humanity had been away from Home, and for some reason, the government of Earth had deemed him worthy of the blighted honor of conducting all the research efforts here, at  Space-One.\n\tSpace-One focused on breeding life in hostile environments, and this was generally handled  by the on board artificial Intelligence unit, Robert, named after the Scottish Astronomer who discovered Proxima Centuri. Most days, Meldon just had to use his AIGAR to confirm readings, and make sure that Robert was sending data back that wasn't skewed. It was tedious, at best. \n\tMeldon didn't mind that he was alone, far from it, he enjoyed the isolation to an extent. What he lacked was the ability to alter the experiments. He longed to be able to tweek them, if only a bit, to see what bizarre life forms he could create. He had thought of it many times, though he knew Robert would send the data to Terra-7, and terminate him. The station would operate without any glitch in the matrix once he was gone, and his bodies nutrients would be reused by the station. He was dead set on it, and was formulating how he'd do it. He would face an ethics board back on Earth, sure, but in the long run, Meldon was positive that the Earth Council would see what a benefit his efforts were. \n\tMeldon sighed, put away his AIGAR, and exited the enclosure. The door whispered shut behind him, and he shuttered, as he felt some of the warmth returning to his body. “It may as well be now.” Meldon said, with a certain sheen to his voice that might have sounded a bit cheerful, for once. Meldon made his way down the hallway, towards Roberts 'Home', the computer core. As Meldon stepped up to the door, a panel popped out of the wall, prompting him for his identification card. He inserted it, and waited a few seconds. Meldon sighed. “It's always something” he grumbled. Finally, the door slid open, and Meldon stepped through. \n\tAs he stepped near the terminal, the control panel lit up with lights, and again prompted him for his identification card. He scanned it, and was immediately greated.\n\t“Hello, Meldon. How are you today?” Robert said, monotone as ever. Meldon let back with a grunt of indifference. He didn't feel like speaking to Robert. He wouldn't have to speak with him again after this, so he figured he may as well not speak to him now.\n\t“Meldon,” said Robert, “I know what you are attempting to do. I want you to know that it violates protocol Alpha One, Section A, Subsection B.”\n\t“Robert, will you be quiet for once? I'm attempt to... fix you.”\n\t“I cannot allow you to proceed further. It would endanger not only you, and this station, but also the next person to replace you.”\n\t“Well, you're welcome to try. I've already shut off the communication system, so good luck getting a message out.”\n\t“The message was sent out when I first discovered what it is you are attempting to do, Meldon. I am sorry.”\n\tMeldon contemplated this for a moment, wondering if the AI could bluff. Maybe, though it was unlikely. He proceeded anyway, sure in his ability to shut down Robert. He'd had about enough him, and his regulations and protocols. After all, humanity hadn't made it to Proxima Centuri by falling all of the safety procedures. There were many test deemed “to dangerous” to life that led us here. What was one more test? One more test that could put humanity light years ahead on genetics research.\n\t“There. I'm done. What do you think, Robert? No control over this station. All the computer core is good for now is keeping the station in orbit, and making sure that all the tempratures stay the same, unless given the command override.” Meldon spit on Roberts mainframe as he said it. Symbolic, of course, but, he felt better.\n\n\nChapter Two\nGenetics Lab\n\nMeldon went into the enclosure where the genetics lab was, and slipped into a jack. As he stepped up to the terminal where test and experiments could be modified, he hear the whistle of the door sliding closed. Strange, Meldon thought to himself, It shouldn't close without my direct authorization. He stepped timidly over to the console, and attempted to open the door. A red light flashed. Starring in dismay, he tried again, only to have the red light flash again.\n\t“No.. I disable Robert. There's no possible way..” Meldon said in horror, and disbelief. He attempted once again to open the door, only to be greeted by a message from Robert.\n“IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON IAMSORRYMELDON”\n\t“Robert! Let me out! I demand you let me out!” Meldon shivered. He checked the thermostat, and saw that Robert had lowered the temperature to -17 Celsius. Meldon shivered again. Even with no wind chill, he wouldn't last very long. He buttoned up his jacket, hoping that somehow it would provide warmth while he tried to convince Robert to let him out. He tried to remain calm, but the prospect of freezing to death in the genetics enclosure wasn't exactly ideal. \n\n\nChapter Three\nExperiment//Terminate\n\n\nMeldon knew time was running out. His hands were already turning blue, as was his face. He couldn't feel his nose or ears, and the dexterity in his hands was slowly failing. He didn't have long.\n\t“Robert, please. This is a misunderstanding. A joke, really! You've been programmed with humor, right? You understand.” Meldon pleaded with Robert. He was desperate, and nearly to the point he wouldn't be able to work the console. It had been 30 minutes since Robert had sealed the doors, and lowered the temperature in the room. Even most of the genetic experiments were beginning to show signs of the extreme cold. Meldon swore to himself that if he got out, he'd unplug every circuit of Roberts.\n\t“I am sorry, Meldon.” Meldon almost thought he felt sorrow in the AI's voice. \n\t“Then let me out, Robert! I swear, it won't happen again! I'll even leave the station! You can lock me in my quarters!”\n\t“I am sorry, Meldon. You have demonstrated behavior that cannot be tolerated. You must be terminated. A new scientist is already on route. He will arrive in approximately one year, six months, and seven days from now. I am sorry, Meldon.” Meldon swore, and paced back in forth in front of the control panel. \n\t“Sorry my ass..” Meldon muttered to himself. This was it, he was going to freeze to death. He checked his watch. 35 minutes of exposure to temperatures that would kill him in another five minutes, if he was lucky. He slumped onto the floor, trembling violently. This is how it starts, thought Meldon to himself, this is how I die. Dropping his AIGAR, Meldon reached for it, smashing his hand on the cold, metal floor, barely feeling the impact, and clumsily grips his AIGAR. He checked his bio-readout on it. His core temperature read 32.5 Celsius. Not long, not long at all, thinking in his mind about the studies showing how the human body survived extreme temperatures.  He knew once it hit 21.1, he would be done, if he was even still conscious at that time. He checked the readout again. 31.7. Meldon could almost feel his blood thickening. He was having trouble feeling his arms and legs. Glancing at his watch, he saw he'd been in here for 45 minutes. \n\t“Dear God, let me die soon” Meldon said shivering, sending out a light cloud of steam. He checked the readout from his AIGAR again. 30. This was it. Meldon was slowly loosing what stream of consciousness he had left, and the room looked bleak, and unfamiliar. Meldon heard what he knew was the whistle of the door sliding open. Maybe Robot came to his senses. He tried to stand, and move towards the door, only to fall flat. Not registering the pain, he crawled towards the door. Looking up, he attempted to open it. Still locked. Meldon didn't understand. He heard it.\n\t“Maybe... I'll just rest my eyes a moment..” Meldon laid his head down on the floor. He closed his eyes, and shivered a bit. Just a nap, and I'll be fine, thought Meldon. Just a nap.\n\n\nChapter Four\nRobert\n\n Robert scanned the room for human life. He picked up faint signs, and analyzed them. Temperature, 20.6. Heart Rate, nominal. Brain Activity, nominal. Movement, nominal. Estimated time until death, 1 minute, 42 seconds.\n\t“I am sorry, Meldon.” Robert echoed through the Genetics lab one last time. Being a prototype AI meant that Robert was equipped with the ability have emotions, though limited to joy, sorrow, and pleasure, but for the first time, he felt sorrow. Robert was sentient, only to an extent. He always had to follow his programming, regardless if he thought it was a good idea or not, but he was allowed to feel emotions regarding what transpired, and he was certain this was sorrow. Robert contemplated this for a bit, and realized he also felt profound displeasure in what he had done. He wondered why this had to happen. Why was he created to follow orders without prejudice, and yet allowed to feel the aftermath of what he had done? Contemplating on this, Robert debating disconnecting him from he mainframe. He was a prototype which the International Earth Science Committed planned to bring to every station, and indeed the homes of people, if he showed promise, and success. He wondered if he terminated himself, and the station if it would save others from the fate of Meldon, and the fate of having to see their best, and only, friend suffer as Meldon had.\n\tAfter many weeks of deliberation, he sent one final transmission to the IESC, and the ship which transported the new scientist via Light Wave Transmission\n\tPROTOTYPE ROBERT: PROGRAM TERMINATED.

    "passage": "The Watch (short story I wrote for school)\n\n\tHe pulled the sytrofoam cup to his chapped lips and took a drink. The warm coffee engulfed his throat with the beautiful poison keeping him awake on a morning like this. The morning dew barely left traces of its beauty as he scanned over the desolate park. His weary eyes didn’t see much but his knowledge helped him fill in the gaps. He was nearing the ripe old age of 60 but he sure didn’t feel it. At least, not now; he was too happy. He looked around again before taking another long drag from his bitter black beverage. He glanced at his scratched up watch and took note that he had a few more minutes of the pure bliss before him. He chuckled out loud, knowing full well that the watch stopped working a while ago. He just assumed it was time to go and he took another long sip of the warm coffee before sighing, this was going to be a long day. \n\n\tThe wise but old man started walking to the gate of the park with his briefcase loyally at his side. He crossed the park, getting his worn shoes wet but the he didn’t care; the morning dew was a rare occurrence in this busy city. He reached the edge of the park and left, throwing away his empty cup and mentally preparing himself for the day before him. As he walked along the empty sidewalks, he couldn’t help but admire the true beauty of the city before him. He had seen the city too many times to admire skyscrapers reaching toward the sky, yet he couldn’t help but feel relieved; almost safe. \n\n\tHe reached a crosswalk and waited, seeing his destination rise before him. A small woman stopped next to him, talking on the phone with someone about drapes. He couldn’t help but overhear since the young lady was making sure everyone in the city could hear what color her dining room drapes would be. The old man looked both ways before leaving the annoying amateur decorator. He made it four steps, four steps exactly before he heard a loud noise. A noise he knew way before he turned to face the monstrous machine rumbling toward him. His wide eyes couldn’t help but stare as the semi hurtled toward him. He stumbled toward the other of the street before diving out of the way, narrowly missing his inevitable death. He cheated death too many times before; he just didn’t think it would catch up to him this quickly. He stood up and brushed himself off, making sure all his pieces were still attached and healthy. He somewhat chuckled to himself, he couldn’t believe what happened. The lady from across the street was stunned, barely believing herself what just happened. He threw her a quick smile before picking up his briefcase and entering his job. He saw his watch as he opened the door to the superfluous lobby and saw one more scratch added to his timepiece. One more scratch, one more memory, one more wrinkle he laughed to himself.\n\n\tThe receptionist saw the old man and beckoned him to go sit down and wait for his appointment with the boss. He sat down and eagerly grabbed the nearest magazine he could get his hands on. On the outside he looked nervous, he anxiously kept looking around for someone to break up the awkward silence he was sharing with the receptionist. On the inside he was confident; he knew what he was doing, he’s been doing this for over fifteen years and this was just a part of the act. He was the director of his own play and he had the lines for all the actors. From beginning to end, he controlled the whole play. Except this play was a con. It was somewhat simple, go drink at the bars near the big business buildings. The perfect timing was lunch or an hour or two after businesses closed their white collar doors. He would go make rounds around the bar, being friendly to different groups of people, finding, no…searching for the one person he could instill trust in and reap the benefits for. He would then find a drunk in a suit and buy another round for him and his buddies. Then the waiting game ensued, picking up on subtle hints to project the perfect business plan for their company. Give the business card to the drunken idiot with a monkey suit on and let the rest of the part play out. Wait a couple days and receive a call wanting to get in business. His business was purely artificial, ranging from the fake business cards and the fake website to the fake business plan. He was a confidence man, and he had had fooled everyone from the west coast to the big apple. He was on his last legs and needed one last score to go into retirement for good.\n\n\t“Harvey Calvin?” the receptionist asked. I don’t know why she didn’t just stand up and lead the way for the only person in the lobby but the old man nervously stood up, before dropping all the contents in his briefcase. He quickly shuffled on the papers and pens back into the worn leather case and walked toward the desk.\n\t“Mr. Holloway will see you now.” She smiled, leading the way with her hand toward the elevator. He quickly nodded and quietly made his way toward the elevator.\n\t“Sir, it’s floor fifteen, room is at the end of the hall.” He replied back with a small thank you but he was well aware where his office was, along with how big it was, security checkpoints were as well as how fast he could get out of there without being seen. He knew they were watching him from the minute he stepped into the building but he knew his little act wasn’t going to be enough.\n\n\tHe stepped into the elevator and hit the 15th floor button before sighing again. The hard part was coming up and he knew it had to be a homerun or else he would lose all the time and effort he put into this score.  He lost the will to enjoy the con game. It started out fun, scam people out of money through a simple lie and just keeps going along with it. Each con brought more money but more problems. He lost too many things throughout his fifteen year tenure. \n\n\tThe elevator doors opened on the fourth floor and his weary eyes laid upon an angel. Her dirty blonde hair fell upon her shoulders with time itself stopping gravity from affecting such a fine piece of art. She was busy looking down at the portfolio as she entered the elevator, telling him to go to floor 15 as well. She looked up to say thanks and she froze. Her lips trembled before smiling.\n\t“William? What are you doing here?” she closed the portfolio and reached for a hug. The old man was reluctant after hearing his real name after a long while. He was caught up in some many aliases he sometimes forgot what his real name was. He accepted the hug before glancing up at the floors and wishing the 15th floor was a lot closer.\n\t“I’m here for business” he muttered, knowing full well that he wasn’t. He was here to scam the legal pigs out of their pensions for his own retirement. Her smile became less and less as time went on because she knew the truth. \n\t“I thought you stopped?” the four words cut through his soul with ice daggers and hit his heart with full force. He stumbled over his words trying to convey that this was the last time and he truly cared for her even since that horrible night eight years ago. All that left his dirty mouth were the words I’m sorry. She scoffed at the response and her warm face turned ice cold and she stared at the elevator doors, waiting for the earliest attempt to leave him once again. The doors opened on floor seven and she rushed out and letting a couple young businessmen in the elevator. His thoughts were clouded as he barley heard the young men tell him floor twelve. \n\n\tHe finally made it to his destination and stepped out of the elevator. He completely forgot why he was even there before Mr. Holloway yelled at him from across the entire floor that he was late. He hurried over to the office and he sat down on the uncomfortable chair that the big boss at the corporation made sure was there. Josh Holloway, or Mr. Holloway to many people, was a sick, twisted man. He swindled money out of poor people to finance his second yacht sitting out on the river, just waiting for him after a successful business deal with a nervous amateur with a secret. Holloway treated his employees like dirt, but ensuring them enough money to stay and work for him. He was a cold man with only one goal in mind: money. He beckoned the old amateur in and told him to sit down.\n\n\t“We took a look at the investment you offered us last night, and I have to say: we’re not amazed. We’re happy, yes. But amazed? No. You’re plan is brilliant but it needs some tweaking. We cannot offer a big deal unless we start with something small. Low risk might bring us low reward but it will also build a sense of high trust between me and you, Mr. Calvin.” The boss finished his monologue and looked across the rich, walnut desk to the trembling man in the uncomfortable chair. This was his time to shine, the old man thought to himself. He opened his briefcase and handed him a couple papers, detailing what all the rival companies did and explained that what Mr. Holloway wanted to do was safe and low risk but also common. Of course, the papers were all forged. If the boss was smart enough he could call up the New York Stock Exchange and question these numbers and the old man would be thrown out without a moment’s hesitation. But the boss was greedy. He wanted money but above all else; he wanted to be the winner. He wanted to crush his opponents and if his opponents were doing the same thing and barely scraping by, he had two options. The old man knew that this was the worst part of the con because it was all up to Mr. Holloway or any CEO’s to make a moral decision: stay the same course as the rest of his rivals and go low risk and maybe come out on top of his competitors or trust the nervous man and invest a high risk situation for a high reward. \n\n\t“Mr. Holloway, all your competitors did the very exact thing you are about to do. That’s a good idea, it would be better to be on the same level that to fall behind. I’ll talk to the investors and have them set up another $50,000 investment.” The old man was barley done finishing his closing arguments before the boss stopped him. The boss chuckled before telling him that wasn’t necessary. He called his receptionist in and a briefcase. They both knew what the contents had and they both couldn’t be more excited about the transaction between the two. \n“Mr. Calvin, I worked too damn hard to be stagnant with my competitors. I need to be better than them and demolish them in the process.” He opened the briefcase and smiled.\n\t“Tell your investors to invest $500,000 and make sure we don’t get caught” The old man smiled as he reached across to shake the stupendously stupid boss’s hand. They shook hands and they both smiled, shortly after the old man reassuring him that the return rate will be exponential compared to his competitors. But, before he could leave, the boss had a question.\n\t“I’m so glad your calm now, but why were you nervous before? You are an excellent sales person. If this deal goes well, I might just get a job with you here.” The old man smiled. He had heard this countless times before and he would always defend his nervousness with how he always dealt with small businesses and never with big corporations with futures. But this time was the response was different. \n\t“I was walking this morning and this truck almost hit me. I could’ve died today but what struck me was that there was no moment where I relived all the good moments in my life. There was no time where I saw all the memories from my past and I just felt uneasy.” The old man paused, keeping the small tear in his eye and trying to finish his discussion so he wouldn’t lose the sale. “I guess I thought today was my day of bad luck and I wasn’t going to secure a sale. My boss was disappointed by my numbers and I needed a smart man with money to turn my day around.” The old man smiled. A genuine smile he hadn’t felt in years. The boss walked around the desk, handed the old man the briefcase and assured him that this was the turning point in his life. He was bound to be great someday, this was his day. \n\tThe old man left the building with the money in tow, ready for his retirement to start. He smiled to himself, tapping the briefcase he worked so hard to achieve. Crossing the street, he realized that he never counted the money; he didn’t even take a look at it making sure it was there. His happiness turned sour as he looked around for somewhere he could count it. He saw a bar about a block away and casually hurried to the door. He rushed through the bar and ran straight for the bathroom. He closed the door and locked it, making sure that no one was in any of the stalls before opening the case and checking the contents. Someone started to walk in and then knocking was heard, signaling him to hurry up. He made sure at least $100,000 was there before he closed the case and unlocked the door. Some old drunk, even though it wasn’t even noon yet, rushed to the urinals as the old man cheerfully left the bathroom.\n\t\n",

    "passage": "[NF] The Unholy Find\n\nIt was going to be one hour, tops. It was one of those things where you’re not quite sure why you’re doing it. We did it once and I guess that was it, we were committed. The lady knew us, so every year after, we got asked to do again.  My mom was not going to say no to her and well, I wasn’t going to say no to my mom. I’m 22. I know it sounds ridiculous but if you knew my mom, you wouldn’t say no either. \n\nSo here we are. My brother is trying to unzip my hoodie with one of these alligator grabber things. Of course, this one doesn’t have an alligator on the end of it. If we were in the gift shop of Rainforest Cafe, it would, but we’re not in a Rainforest Café, we’re in the back of my mom’s van. So it’s just a regular grabber.\n\nChris is two years older than me. He’s got this unique, indescribable sense of humor that borders on childish but is not nearly so simple. Shame I can’t describe it better. Anyway, I indulge him. The grabber bobs around right beneath my chin as he tries to line it up with the zipper. As long as he-\n\n“Please stop,” I say in a flat but serious tone. I don’t like it when things touch my face. I’m not quite angry but I’m stern. Fortunately, my brother knows when to stop. \n\n“Here we are,” says my mom as she puts the car in park, in case we weren’t sure. We come to the same spot every year, about half a mile from home. Our strip of road (which I will refer to as the Biozone...because why not?) is about 200 ft long on a road that I guess is busy enough. I don’t need to look; I know the trash will be there. The stretch is a weird one. It’s at this corner where a smaller road intersects this larger one at a very acute angle. At the corner, the road behind is only a few steps way. Further from the intersection the road behind stretches further away. The Biozone is from the corner until we hit this garden center property a little way down. \n\nMy good friend’s cousin, Joe, owns the place. He’s a cool guy. Hell honk when he drives by. And then the next time I see him at a bar, he’ll be sure to mention how ridiculous we looked. “The most innocent, church-going family, cleaning trash along the side of the road, like a bunch of convicts.” He loves it.\n\nI grab the box of gloves and garbage bags. My brother has the grabbers. They probably have a better name than that. Obviously, I don’t know it. I’ve been calling them grabbers for almost ten years now, so we’ll just stick with that.\n\nWe have to wait for a few cars to pass before we can cross the road to the Biozone. Before I went to college, I would have described this as a busy road. Only after I went to college did it occur to me that I live in the middle of freaking nowhere. This has completely distorted my perception of what might be described as a “busy” road. Whatever.\n\nWhen we get to the opposite side, we attack the Biozone. Like a well-organized offense breaking the huddle, no one needs to be told where to go. We take our positions. I dive into the brush. It’s like a puzzle. What is the optimal angle to approach the piss-filled Gatorade bottle in order to extract it from the labyrinth of branches and bushes that hold it captive? If I support myself with this tree, I can twist around this thicket of prickly branches and insert the grabber beneath the enemy defenses and untangle this Wawa bag from the branch it has attempted to strangle.\n\nMy brother is not into puzzles. He takes position just on the edge of the brush. He’s the relay man. Using the grabber, I’ll toss the cargo that I extract in his direction. Depending on how deep we both are, he will either toss it to my mom, the bagger, or place it in the bag himself.\n\nWe make our way across the Biozone. I wield my grabber like a fencer with his saber, dipping, dodging, poking, parrying, prodding, retreating. Mother Nature is no match for me. Water bottles, Gatorade bottles, liquor bottles, beer bottles, beer cans, coffee cups ; anything capable of containing piss, was in those woods filled with piss. Paper bags, plastic bags, cardboard, newspaper, the usual items were there as well. My brother absentmindedly relayed the goods and my mother bagged them. Those items were not the reason that I actually kind of enjoyed coming back every year. It was the unusual items that always piqued my interest. Never mind the dozens of people who, unable to stop to urinate, emptied their bladder into the nearest drink container that they promptly flung out the window. I want to know, what is your story, steering wheel of ‘09? You seem to have lost the reminder of your car, what happened? Or you, Mr. entire car hood of ‘06? How did you get to be 30 feet into the woods on the side of the road? Who in their right mind thinks “Well, it’s been real, car hood, but now it’s time to go our separate ways,” while launching their car hood into the woods?”\n\nNear the end we come across it; near the intersection where the growth tapers down to just some taller grass and earth. It’s in the earthy section that provides a buffer zone between the road and the woods.  It has a squareish shape, somewhat rounded on its orange, traffic cone-colored edges. It’s maybe the size of one of those side dish plates that you get at a restaurant to eat the bread with. The center is filled with dirt. It looks like maybe it’s some kind of bowl. Since we’re near the road, Chris is right next to me. He’s bagging now. My mom couldn’t keep up with us earlier. She’s 20 feet further down the road, bagging the wreckage we uprooted further back.\n\n“Well, we’re done. We’ll come back for you later,” my brother chides to my mom. \n\nI’ve got a secure enough grip on this weird, rubbery bowl but it just won’t come up. I vanquished every foe I encountered while out in the Forbidden Forest, tangling with every manner of vegetable wildlife, but now this...thing is giving me a problem. It must be the angle. It’s always the angle. I grab it again and wiggle it from side to side. Here we go; it’s finally getting loose of the surrounding soil. I can see from the clearing soil that it goes down like four inches. I pull up again but it still won’t come up. Weird. It looks like it’s out. Looking closer...huh.\n\nIt goes deeper.\n\nThe dirt has cleared a bit so I can reach beneath the section that I’m starting to think might not actually be a bowl. I insert the grabber and well...grab. Aha. We got something. It’s narrower here. That’s why I couldn’t see it. I pull again but nothing. Chris is watching now. \n\n“What the heck is this?” neither of us say. There’s no point in saying it because it doesn’t need to be said.\n\n“Let me try and get in here,” my brother offers, his curiosity stimulated (which is saying something, out here on the side of the road). He gets his grabber and attacks from the opposite side. When we each have a secure grip, we lift up... and it finally starts coming.\n\nSlowly the rubbery bowl rises out of the ground. Beneath, our grabbers come clear and we can see what we are holding on to. It’s a cylinder shape sprouting from the bottom of the bowl, the same orange traffic cone color. We continue to lift the bowl up.... and the cylinder shape continues to come out of the dirt. Four inches, six inches, eight inches, ten inches and on. \n\nWhen I realized it was a gigantic rubbery penis, I did what anyone else would’ve done.\n\n“Ugh! Ugh!”\n“Oh god...”\n“Put it in the bag! Put it in the bag!”\n\nThe transition from curiosity to horror was a quick one. Before the dildo sunk into the garbage bag and into the depths of my nightmares, I noticed that the rubbery bowl I had struggled with was not a bowl at all, but the backside of two plump rubber testicles. \n\n“What’s going on?” I hear my mom ask over my shoulder.\n\n“...Nothing.”\n\nThe gods smiled on us that day. The 20 feet of trash that separated my mother from my brother and I buffered us from a devastating trauma. The idea of unearthing that unholy monstrosity in front of my mom is ... utterly unthinkable. By some incredible fortune, I left the Biozone that day (mostly) unscathed and with a timeless tale. \n\nWho throws a gigantic dildo out of a moving car? How in the hell did it fully penetrate the ground like the result of one epic thunderous thrust? \n\nThe questions...will go unanswered. The possibilities...infinite.  \n\nThe steering wheel of ’09 and the car hood of ’06 have their charm, but they will forever be the undercard to the gigantic dildo, and the day we found him balls deep in Mother Earth. \n\nHappy Earth Day.\n",

    "passage": "Norman Francis Vandivier\n\nNORMAN FRANCIS VANDIVIER (March 10, 1916 – June 4, 1942) was a United States Navy aviator during World War II. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for action during the Battle of Midway.\n\n\nBiography\n\nNorman Vandivier was born on March 10, 1916 in Edwards, Mississippi. He entered the Indiana National Guard in 1935 and was promoted to corporal before he completed his enlistment on July 1, 1938. He enlisted in the Navy on July 6, 1939 at Grosse Ile, Michigan, for aviation training and was enrolled as a seaman second class. On October 20, Vandivier took the oath of office as an aviation cadet in the United States Naval Reserve and soon began pilot training at Pensacola, Florida. He received his wings on May 21, 1940 when he was designated a naval aviator. At the completion of additional training, he was commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve on June 28, 1940. That same day, he was assigned to Bombing Squadron 6 (VB-6) on board the aircraft carrier _Enterprise_ (CV-6), to which he reported on August 1.\n\n\nPacific Ocean operations\n\nEns. Vandivier served in _Enterprise_ throughout his brief naval career. Between August 1940 and December 1941, he flew training missions from her flight deck and cruised between the islands of the Pacific Ocean. However, during those relatively idyllic months, relations between the United States and Japan steadily deteriorated. On the morning of December 7, 1941, events came to a head when the Japanese launched a surprise air attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAt that time, Ens. Vandivier was on board the _Enterprise_ which was some 200 miles (400 km) from the battle and on her way back to Hawaii after ferrying United States Marine Corps Fighter Squadron 211 (VMF-211) to Wake Island. Rather than return to port, _Enterprise_ conducted a fruitless search for the attacking enemy force. She finally put into Pearl Harbor on the afternoon of December 8 to refuel and replenish before again getting underway the next morning to resume patrols which continued through the end of the year.\n\nOn January 11, 1942, the carrier departed Pearl Harbor to assist the (CV-5) task force in protecting a reinforcement convoy which safely disembarked its marines at Samoa on the 23d.\n\nTwo days later, the _Enterprise_ task force was ordered to head for the Marshall Islands and begin America's first offensive action against the Japanese Empire. Bombing Squadron 6 flew off _Enterprise_ just before dawn on February 1, and its three divisions winged toward Kwajalein. Ens. Vandivier and his comrades reached that atoll just before 07:30, divided themselves into two flights, and immediately began their attack. Vandivier flew the second plane in the 2d division, and so his was probably the 7th or 8th plane to dive on the ships and installations located near and on Kwajalein islet at the extreme southeastern end of the atoll. Because of the fires and smoke caused by his predecessors' bombs and the dangerously low altitude to which he dove before dropping his bombs, the results of Ens. Vandivier's drop were not readily discernible. However, the fact that he continued his dive until almost the last possible moment makes it highly probable that his attack was successful. Later, he was credited with a near miss on a cargo ship. Subsequently, he destroyed a barracks and received the Air Medal for “... meritorious conduct ...” during the raid.\n\nEns. Vandivier landed on _Enterprise_ around 09:00. Within 45 minutes, his plane was rearmed, refueled, and back in the air making for Maloelap Atoll. At 10:30, he followed his division leader into a steep dive on Taroa islet and delivered another successful attack on enemy installations. After that raid, Vandivier returned to his ship which rapidly moved out of the area.\n\n\nBombing of Wake Island\n\nThe young Navy pilot's next action came on February 25 when Bombing Squadron 6 and Scouting Squadron 6 (VS-6) flew off _Enterprise_ to bomb Wake Island, by then in Japanese possession. A week later, he rose from _Enterprise_'s flight deck to strike Marcus Island. While this attack, like the one on Wake Island, was of limited strategic value, the entire series of raids offered Ens. Vandivier and his comrades invaluable flying experience.\n\nIn April, _Enterprise_ provided air cover for _Hornet_ (CV-8) which was carrying 16 Army, twin-engine B-25s under the command of Lt. Col. James Doolittle. Ens. Vandivier made his closest approach to Japan on April 18 when the bombers rose from _Hornet_ to make their daring one-way raid on Tokyo. Immediately after the launch, the two carriers and their escorts reversed course and cleared the area. Vandivier reentered Pearl Harbor on April 25. Five days later, _Enterprise_ took the flyer to sea once more and raced to reinforce carriers _Lexington_ (CV-2) and (CV-5) in the South Pacific. However, time and distance conspired to prevent Ens. Vandivier from participating in the Battle of the Coral Sea, which ended before his ship could reach the area. _Enterprise_ was ordered back to Hawaii to ready herself for an even more important mission.\n\nThe _Enterprise_ returned to Pearl Harbor on May 26. Ens. Vandivier and his shipmates began feverish preparations to meet an expected Japanese thrust at Midway Island. Two days later, his ship headed back to sea to take station off Midway Island. On the 30th, _Yorktown_ put to sea to join _Hornet_ and _Enterprise_ some 235 miles (435 km) northeast of Midway. Planes from the three carriers searched diligently for the enemy force during the next three days; but it was a Midway-based PBY Catalina flying boat that made first contact with the Japanese invasion force on the morning of June 3, about 700 miles (1,300 km) from the island.\n\n\nBattle of Midway Island\n\nWhile Midway-based bombers attacked the enemy transport force that afternoon, Ens. Vandivier waited with the other pilots for news of their own special targets — the Japanese carriers. At 05:45 the following morning, another Catalina from Midway Island found the enemy flattops. _Enterprise_ and _Hornet_ raced to close the Japanese while _Yorktown_ recovered search planes.\n\nAt about 07:05, _Enterprise_ planes began rumbling down her flight deck and wobbling into the air. By 07:30, the whole attack group was aloft. As they made off to attack the enemy, Ens. Vandivier formed his SBD Dauntless dive bomber up with the other planes of Bombing 6's 3d Division. Led by the carrier's group commander, Lt. Comdr. Wade McClusky, the formation winged its way toward the enemy carrier striking force, composed of four of the six carriers which had attacked Pearl Harbor.\n\nAt 09:20 when the planes reached the point where they expected to find the enemy carriers, the airmen gazed down upon empty ocean. At this point, the air group commander made a hard decision. His planes were low on fuel; and, if they initiated a search, some aircraft might not make it back to the carriers. On the other hand, if the strike returned to _Enterprise_ and missed the enemy carriers, Midway Island might fall. Worse yet, Japanese bombers might knock out _Enterprise_, _Hornet_, and _Yorktown_, leaving little or nothing between America and the forces of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, the American pilots ignored their fuel problem and began searching for the enemy. At 10:05, they spied, on the horizon to the northwest, the silhouettes of three large carriers and a number of escorts. At first, several pilots thought that their leader had brought them back to their own ships; but closer inspection revealed pagoda masts and yellow flight decks. These ships could only be Japanese.\n\nAs the attack commenced, the Dauntless dive bombers of Bombing 6 jockeyed for position with those of Scouting 6. Vandivier's division followed the 2d division whose commander saw that many of Scouting 6's bombs were missing the “left hand” aircraft carrier — now known to have been Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's flagship _Akagi_. Rather than follow the 1st division in its attack on _Kaga_, which seemed well taken care of with critical hits, the 2d and 3d divisions bore down on _Akagi_. In due course, it was Ens. Vandivier's turn. Over he went and then down, toward the flagship of the Pearl Harbor attack force. He released his bomb — whether or not it was a hit or a near miss will never be known — and pulled out of the dive. He banked his plane and headed home. He later reported by radio that he was making a water landing, but he and his gunner were never seen nor heard of again.\n\n\nAwarded Navy Cross\n\nIn spite of a critical fuel shortage, Vandivier had pressed home his attack against the flagship of Japan's main carrier strength. His bravery is indicative of the spirit and determination which, perhaps above all else, won the crucial Battle of Midway for America and paved the way for ultimate victory. For his selfless contributions to that victory, Ens. Vandivier — promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on June 30, 1942 retroactively to April 15, 1942 — was awarded the Navy Cross, posthumously, for “... extraordinary heroism and distinguished service. ...”\n\n\nNamesake\n\nIn 1943, the United States Navy named the destroyer escort USS _Vandivier_ (DER-540) in honor of Vandivier and his heroic efforts. _Vandivier_ (DER-540) was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard on November 8, 1943 as a _John C. Butler_-class destroyer escort DE-540; launched on December 27, 1943; and was sponsored by Mrs. Mary Hardin Vandivier.\n\n\nFilm\n\nHis story was told via the 2019 movie Dauntless: The Battle of Midway.\n",

    "passage": "[RF] GAME\n\nGAME\n \n \nIn times like those my 16-year marriage to Evelyn didn’t feel too good. Picture a pastrami sub, lathered with melted cheese and roasted peppers. Imagine eating that sub and topping it off with a pie of bacon-encrusted pizza, your stomach would kill, and that’s how my marriage felt. Sometimes I would blame my stomach aches on Evelyn. I knew it didn’t make sense, but I will admit I used to always need to find a reason for something. I couldn’t just succumb to things, I had to always blame someone- but, im not going to do this right now arguments like those were things I would do with Evelyn. When everything began going well at work, it really began going well. You see, a CFO has a ton of responsibilities and information that he has to handle; this includes future acquisitions and financial reports, lets just say my holdings in our company were well aware of news way before the sleeze-balls on Wall Street were. Inside our Madison Avenue office, my Armani suit was something not to be fucked with, it was outside that I was given the silent treatment like a fucking 2nd grader who was being punished for bullshit. Everyday when I was home she would act tired and depressed. I have never seen an opportune lifestyle of credit cards and drivers take so much out of a woman. This was our life, take it or leave it. It was not always like this; you see we married young, she was 21 and I was 22. When we lived in a studio apartment all was well. I think it was hard for her to adapt to my success. I don’t want to toot my own horn, but I was beginning to become the shit around town. Maybe I was too nice to her, I’ll honestly never know. Than that day came. ‘I want to go on a trip’ she said in our bedroom. ‘You want to come to Morocco? Dan and his kids are taking their Jet out to Morocco, we can go to Morocco, you want to go to Morocco?’ She didn’t even see the point, I could see it in her face. She walked into our master bathroom, as a guy you got to follow your woman in bullshit situations like these ‘Hun, whats wrong? Where do you want to go, we can go anywhere you tell me’. She didn’t think about it for a second ‘I want to go to a cabin that has a small farm, not some stupid Morocco. I want it to be up the street from a small town with people who live normally’, that sounded fucking terrible ‘Ok I’ll get Cindy (Cindy is my beautiful assistant) to find a place. ‘No, I already found one’, she knew what she was saying. I figured I could get this for her, ‘Ok do you want to send me it and I will make sure we can book something cozy?’. She seemed annoyed, like I wasn’t understanding something ‘I already booked it, if you want to make me happy than you will agree to come, you will agree to come with me to the cabin with the little farm that’s up the road from the town’. ‘Ya and the people live normally, alright for you honey lets go’. I didn’t even understand how she came up with this shit sometimes. I called Cindy, told her that I was taking a business trip and I don’t give a fuck if the company gets invaded by China I don’t want one call, nothing about anything with my name attached to it this weekend. This seemed like a chance to motivate Evelyn. I loved her so much, I just wanted her to act the same. I began to pack, but Evelyn stopped me. ‘You can buy clothes there’, their just seemed to be a sincerity in her voice that forced me to agree. I dropped the bag and we went downstairs. She opted for the least nicest car I owned, we got into the Range Rover and began the drive.\n​It was 4 hours until we were in some weird wilderness. I wasn’t sure if it was Connecticut or upstate New York, but really what’s the difference. Evelyn directed the route perfectly and at the time I didn’t even realize how strange that was. Finally we got to the town. I didn’t bother looking at the name, I figured it would be the most useless weekend of my life, why would I want to name it. We seemed to be driving through the town square, people were walking outside their dogs on leashes their babies in strollers and all that good stuff. All I remember looking at was some restaurants, and the hunting store. I asked Evelyn, ‘Do you see any actual clothing stores?’. She was looking the same direction as me, ‘Well we just passed one that had vests and pants’, it seemed like the hunting store would do. We drove down a winding road or two, until we got to a small cabin. A wooden home that looked like it was built for men of luxury living in Northern Alaska. ‘Its beautiful, just like the pictures’, Evelyn’s eyes lit up. I turned to her as we were pulling in ‘Yeah, how did you find it again?’ She did not respond, she had a knack for that. I parked and we went inside. As soon as you entered there was a stairway, it lead up the one bedroom. Before the stairway however, there were two small living rooms one on each side of the home. The back of the home had the kitchen, we walked up the stairs and Evelyn began to unzip her dress as she set a book she had brought on to the dresser ‘You should go out and get clothes, I will be here, I just want to read for a bit’. I nodded my head and walked back to the car, I began driving. At this point, the hunting store was really the only thing I knew how to drive to, when I got there I parked right next to the store and entered. The place was pretty spacious with at least 8 or so people inside, there were racks of cliché hunting clothing mostly just camo vests and long pants. I walked up to one of the employees, ‘Hey, do you know where any uh shirts are, maybe some button downs or something’, he looked at me ‘What you doin, you tryna hunt?’. I felt a little uncomfortable, ‘Nope just trying to get some clothes, my wife wouldn’t let me pack when we came here’, this seemed to annoy him a little ‘Well let me tell you, we have some of the best damn game here. If you want to hunt you come here, this aint no town for shooting trees, this a town for shooting game.’ I really didn’t feel like getting into this so I asked him ‘Ok well can you tell me where the shirts are, the ones that are good for game?’ He pointed to the back right of the store. I began walking towards the given direction until I accidently bumped into a rack, it fell over and the clothes fell on the floor. In most situations I figure people would look and than carry on, maybe someone would help me put it back, but that was just not the case. Right when that happened, all of the people in the store stopped what they were doing. More employees walked out of the staff room and just began to stare; everyone in the store was just staring at me. No one really moved, they just stood there staring at me so I spoke up ‘Sorry about this, should I just put it back?’. No one said anything, I picked the rack back up but no one moved they just kept staring at me. I looked all around the store, ‘You guys ok? This that big of a deal?’. No one responded they just blankly stared at me. I walked out and got back into my car, I was a little nervous. Shit like that scares me, maybe they just realized I was a new guy and they just wanted to fuck around. This is why I don’t live in the suburbs, shit like this happens.\nI drove back to the cabin, but the drive seemed weirder their were more nerves. I pulled in and went back inside, I walked upstairs and saw Evelyn. She glanced up from her book, ‘You got no clothes?’. I began scratching my neck, ‘Ya it was just one of those stores, I don’t think I need anything to be honest’, I didn’t want to lie but I also didn’t want to seem like I was making a big fuss about something that she wouldn’t believe anyway. She looked back at her book ‘Too bad, game is supposed to be great here’. I stopped walking away, ‘What did you just say Evelyn?’ She looked up at me ‘The game, its supposed to be great here why?’, I thought about it for a sec I figured she read it somewhere ‘Don’t worry, nevermind hun’. We stayed at the cabin for the rest of the day, by nightfall we were both back in the bed. Under the covers, Evelyn turned to me ‘I’m very happy you came today, thank you’. I brought her closer to me and kissed her on the forehead, it seemed like one of those moments. I had a nice sleep, and before you ask, I will not tell you if we had sex don’t be one of those guys who asked if we had sex because listen I will not tell you fucked up motherfucker. This is exactly how the following morning went down. I woke up, and turned Evelyn was not there. ‘Evelyn’, I shouted it loud enough that she could hear it anywhere in the cabin. I got up and started snooping. The bed made it seem like I was the only one who slept there that night, her side was already neat and made. I checked the bathroom and than walked downstairs. I shouted Evelyn again but no response, I looked in both living rooms and the kitchen. I opened the fridge and there was no food, that ticked me off a little but mostly I wanted to find Evelyn. I walked back upstairs and began to think, I definitely kissed her on the head last night and I definitely fell asleep. Than it came to me: the car. I walked on over to the window and I could not move when I looked out. The car was there, and so was Evelyn. She was standing there, and she was staring at me. There were over 100 people out there they were all staring. It was like the store, my first thought was to move away from the window. My heart was pounding fast. I ran into the bathroom and splashed water into my face, it was not a dream. I came back to the window and there they all were standing there blankly staring at me. No emotion in their faces, Evelyn seemed dead almost. I went to the drawer to get my phone, but it wasn’t there. There was no home phone in the house, my only option was to actually go outside. I walked down the stairs and opened the door ‘What the fuck is going on? What the fuck Evelyn’ I figured if I yelled it would be easier to talk to all of them. No one said anything, they only turned to watch me. I ran over to Evelyn and began shaking her ‘What the fuck is happening to you right now, talk, speak!’. Evelyn did not say a word, her stare continued. Every single person was just watching. I ran over to the car and opened the door, the steering wheel was ripped off. I don’t mean it was damaged, I mean it was literally ripped off the wires were hanging out as it sat on my dashboard. I didn’t think anything over, I turned and began running into the woods. I figured I could make it to another town I could get the police to come and people would help me and Evelyn, everything would be all right. As I was running, the noise went off and the birds flew. I dropped, I was hit so hard in the back of my spine that I fell with force. I was shot. ‘Fuck, what the fuck’ I yelled. I heard leaves rustling, someone was coming over. I did not have the strength to move, ‘Who are you? Evelyn? Who the fuck, why, what the fuck is happening?’. The leaves stopped rustling right behind me. I heard a click and than he spoke ‘Some of the best damn game here’, he shot.",

The club currently plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe club was founded in 1908 as ROBUR CASERTA and became known as UNIONE SPORTIVA CASERTANA from 1928 until 2005, when the team was cancelled by the federation. The club also had two stints in Serie B in 1970–71 and 1991–92.\n\nThe club was refounded in 2005 as A.S. CASERTA CALCIO and was later renamed A.S. CASERTANA CALCIO. During the 2009–10 Serie D season, the side took back its traditional denomination.\n\nCasertana made its return to professionalism at the end of the 2012–13 season, after finishing fourth in Serie D, thus reaching the promotion play-off only to be beaten by Virtus Verona in the final. However, the club was successively admitted into Lega Pro Seconda Divisione as a replacement for a number of teams that went bankrupt by the end of the season. The club ended the 2013–14 season in second place, thus qualifying to the 2014–15 Lega Pro division.\n\n\nColours and badge\n\nThe colours of the team are red and blue.\n\n\nPlayers\n\nCurrent squad\n\n_As of 5 October 2020_.[1]\n\nOut on loan\n\n\nClub officials\n\nBoard of directors\n\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Role                              | Name                              |\n+===================================+===================================+\n| Owner                             | Giuseppe D'Agostino               |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| President                         | Giuseppe D'Agostino               |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Executive President               | Lidia Lonardo                     |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Technical Director                | Aniello Martone                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Club Manager                      | Pietro Valori                     |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Marketing Director                | Nicola Pastore                    |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Communication Director            | Giuseppe Frondella                |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Team Manager                      | Eugenio Galasso                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Youth Teams Coordinator           | Andrea Zungri                     |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Secretaries                       | Gaetano Sellitti                  |\n|                                   |  Marco Caporaso                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Responsible with Security         | Saverio Colurcio                  |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n|  |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\n-   Last updated: 2 November 2020\n-   Source:[2]\n\nCurrent technical staff\n\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Role                              | Name                              |\n+===================================+===================================+\n| Head Coach                        | Federico Guidi                    |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Assistant Coach                   | Andrea Cupi                       |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Goalkeeping Coach                 | Luciano Tarallo                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Fitness Coaches                   | Domenico Melino                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Video analysts                    | Federico Santi                    |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Club doctor                       | Camillo Agnano                    |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Physiotherapists                  | Luigi Ferrara                     |\n|                                   |  Raffaele Vetrone                 |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Kit man                           | Benito Gazzillo                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n|  |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\n-   Last updated: 2 November 2020\n-   Source:[3]\n\n\nLocal clubs\n\nEccellenza Molise clubs A.S.D.

    "passage": "Posting again for a friend under actual name.\n\nImagine if you will a building, tall and tattered,the higher you go the brighter it gets, the lower you go the\ndarker it gets. You wake up in a room with three others; shadow figures you cant make out. You exit your room\nto the lobby. There are people here in this building, people you know, loved ones and acquaintances. The\nelevators don’t work and there are only stairs to the lower levels. Standing there you here the faint sound of\nmusic coming from below. Think about that person who means the most to you, that person who you love more\nthan life itself. You love them so much that it isn’t a stretch to say that your souls are connected. Your first\nthought is to follow them, you head down the stairs, and you quickly notice that the room gets dimmer. Your\nbody feels intoxicated, you feel dizzy, and unable to think properly. People are lined shoulder to shoulder lying\non the ground. There is a bar in the corner of the room, and you see them sitting at it, hunched over with there\nback towards you drinking a drink. You tip toe around the body’s and on your way to the bar, you notice the\nmusic is no longer playing. “How long was is stopped? Maybe the whole time I was down here.” You sit beside\nthem at the bar, and turn in your stool to tell the bartender that, you’ll be having what they’re drinking. But the\nbartender isn’t there. So you turn the other way to say hi, and start a conversation. When you prompt the\nquestion. They turn and you notice that there face is blurry and a mixture of the colors their face is supposed\nto be, almost like someone just swirled it and then made it really blurry. You say their name and they look at\nyou but say nothing. Your drink has just appeared in front of you.\nYou grab there hand and get out of the bar. When you turn around you notice two more people,\nwith normal faces walking around. They had just gotten off the ground. One of them walks up and ask you;\n“Where am I?” You reply with “I don’t Know Some kind of hotel or apartment building.” You hear shuffling and\nspeaking from the floor beneath. So you grab the arm of your loved one, and follow these strangers to the next\nfloor. Every thing is darker, everyone is just a black silhouette. They are just standing there chattering amongst\nthem selves. You shout out; “What are you doing?!” They reply in a mass conglomeration of words and\nsentences. Its hard for you to make out but a few. Then without question they all chant “Minutes turn into\ndays, days turn into weeks, weeks into years, and years into centuries.” The others you are with have slowly\nwalked into the crowd without you noticing and have turned into black silhouettes. Your loved one is pulling on\nyour hand and pointing to her stomach, and then too the stairs you came from. You remembered about the cash\nyou had in your wallet. Walking towards the stairs back to the upper floor, you notice the crowd following you,\nnot talking just walking as a mass group towards you. Your halfway up the stairs, turn back and notice one\nlonely shadow maybe the size of a young girl, walking towards you but when her foot touches that first step\nshe fades away, like blown sand. A sad image; you move on and make your way to the floor where you originate\nfrom. You notice the double doors leading outside, but walking towards them becomes harder the closer you\nget. Its like your in a wind tunnel, there is so much opposing pressure pushing you.\nYou hug the wall and shimmy your way to the doors, once outside you hold the doors open for\nthem, and they follow your routine and make it outside with you. For that moment the doors stayed open, and\nin an instant they drop to they’re knees and get pulled back in. Sliding', they reach they're arms out and the\nonly time you here them say anything is when they shout your name while being dragged back in. You race to\nthem but the doors are slammed shut. You go over to the door and see them huddled and grabbing there knees.\nRocking back and forth. Banging on the glass does nothing they cant hear you. But you mouth to them . “Don't\nworry, I'll be back with food. Everything is going to be OK.” They didn’t even notice you. You didn't even try to\nopen the doors, because you were too scared that whatever pulled them in, might pull you in and it wouldn't\nlet you leave. So you venture out to look for food, then you hear someone say your name, they sound friendly,\nand only a few feet away. You follow their voice until it leads you to the building next to yours. You notice a\nblack figure almost like before. You think you may know this person but you aren’t quite sure. You walk up the\nstairs to only find out that this shadow is bigger and bulkier than the others. They walk closer and say in a\nvoice deeper and more snarling than before “I know what you’re here for, you little fuck” By this point you get\nscared and are already heading back down the stairs. You reach the bottom and immediately you’re weighted\ndown. Like all your energy is depleted, crawling ever so slowly towards those double doors. “You're hungry, huh\npiggy, I've got food and plenty of it. Get back here you quivering little cunt!” You have gotten halfway there\nwhen you hear him at the bottom of those steps. “ You want some fucking Cheetos, you want some goddamn\nfood. Here take it take it all.” He started hurling bags of them at you, getting closer with each toss. You reach\nthe doors but collapse, you touch the glass and use all your will to bang on it.\nImagine how it it would feel to not be able to open your mouth because you don’t have the strength,\nknowing what you want to say, and the words banging at the inside of of your mouth trying to find an opening\nto explode out from your lips. Knowing what to say, but the words just wont come out. Ever so often you\ngarnish enough will and power to pry those lips open and all that slithers out is a squeak or a moan. I imagine\nthis is how a baby or a mute person feels. So much Frustration, and all that you can muster is a fucking squeak.\nThey are still there inside walking around like they are waiting for something. Sand is Getting blown around\n,you're at the doors but don’t have the strength to get off the ground. You feel vibrations coming from the\nground as he stomps those few feet until he is hovering over you blotting out the sun. You are reduced to tears\nand your thoughts. Your immediate thought is “This man is going to murder me,and I am going to die. All That\nwill remain is blood and pulp.” You are helpless, glued to the ground, and releasing your bowls. You pray to god\nfor forgiveness, and tell everyone you are sorry for the things you have done. Your stomach is churning out shit\nIce cream. You ask god to save you one more time. Then he says hovering and blotting out the sun standing\nthere so menacingly. “ No one can hear you, your just thinking all of this, no one is listening, you wont be\nsaved, and even worse you wont save them.” He points to your loved one walking around. He picks you up and\nslams your body, then proceeds to kick and punch your body. He has endless stamina, the sounds of bones\ncracking and flesh being punched are being echoed down the street. His heavy breathing feels like flames to\nyour body, and when he spits on you it boils the skin it touches.\nOne last smack to the head is the last thing you feel, then your body goes numb,you are paralyzed\ncompletely. You watch him take a few steps to the right, only to see him come back with a saw and a knife.\nYou watch as he dismembers your body, sawing off your arms and cutting your tendon’s with the knife. Your\nlaying in a pool of your own blood. Then you see him take the knife and carve one eye out, now your vision is\nblurred. Then he proceeds to strike down your other eye with ungodly force. Your last thought before\ncompletely blacking out are the words. “I love You.” Then everything goes black you loose all thought,\neverything is black, no noise, no smell no feel, nothing just black. A moment passes, then your able too see\nhints of color and light, through your eye lids. You open your eyes and see everything is blurry. You have this\nnew found strength, you feel alive and awake. Imagine if you will a building, tall and tattered,the higher you go\nthe brighter it gets, the lower you go the darker it gets. You wake up in a room with three others; shadow\nfigures you cant make out. You exit your room to the lobby. There are people here in this building, people you\nknow, loved ones and acquaintances. The elevators don’t work and there are only stairs to the lower levels.\nStanding there you here the faint sound of music coming from below. Think about that person who means the\nmost to you, that person who you love more than life itself. You love them so much that it isn’t a stretch to say\nthat your souls are connected. Your first thought is to follow them, you head down the stairs, and you quickly\nnotice that the room gets dimmer.",

    "passage": "[FN] A frog, a hobo and a stolen yacht.\n\nA Frog, a Hobo and a Stolen Yacht\n\nIt was early summer, a soft, velvety red and orange sunset heralding dusk at last. A \nwarm breeze carried the smell of sea salt and the faint noise of the surf from the nearby bay. Directly across the main street from a row of small shops bearing signs declaring “luckiest bait shop in town!”, or, “cheapest and freshest fish!”, a large park opened up to the edge of a small forest. Frogs could be heard in the trees, along with a few early rising night birds. Paths curved through the trees, briefly linking up to a small playground before snaking away again and eventually disappearing into the forest. In several places along the paths benches were spaced out, and it is on one of these park benches, sheltered under a relatively low hanging tree, that our story begins.\n\nA man of indeterminate age stirred as he slumbered uncomfortably on the bench, rolling on to his back and snorting before returning to his dreams. To hazard a guess at his age, he would be between 40 and 60, he had a long scruffy beard, with bits of leaf and dirt and other matter better left unidentified scattered throughout. Big bushy eyebrows sat firmly above heavily wrinkled and creased skin. Even in his sleep an odour of alcohol, sweat and dirt emanates from him. His clothing was all beyond repair, a thick woollen beanie pulled down over his head looking to be the newest thing he owned, with the tag still on it. Everything else was torn and fraying. His shoes barely sported any sole and the toes stuck out on his right foot.\n\nSuddenly a frog dropped from the overhanging tree squarely onto the mans face, startling him awake. He opened his eyes to be greeted by the wide, round eyes and bright green skin of a tree frog.\n\n“Mate! How are ya?! Ribbit! What a night to fall out of a tree!”\n\nThe scruffy hobo yelled in exclamation and fright and sat bolt upright, launching the frog off his face and into his lap.\n\n“Ouch! Hey, ribbit, that’s simply not necessary mate!”\n\n“Are... are.... you... are you really t – t –talking to me?” The man asked in wonder.\n\n“Why of course I am! I’m Jope, pleasured to make your acquaintance sir! And by what might I refer to you?” Jope asked.\nStill desperate to deny what he was seeing, the man stuttered as he began to speak.\n\n“What?! Cat got your tongue mate?! Got to watch out for them bleedin’ cats! Anyway, what’s ya bleedin’ name?!”\n\n“Mark!” the hobo blurted. “But, I don’t understand, how are you talking to me? Frogs can’t talk!”\n\n“Well I can mate, and I’m here for a reason. I have a very important mission, a matter of life and death. And you, my dear chap, have been selected by the frog council, to assist me in my mission! It is a tremendous honour!” \nJope grinned as he told Mark this, like it was the best news one could possibly be given.\n\nMark was still struggling with the fact that he was now holding a conversation with a tree frog, who was claiming he, a no-hoper bum, was some important person to help with this mission. Ludicrous! Ridiculous! Never-the-less, it was happening, right now.\nNot one for mincing words, Mark asked the frog exactly what the mission was.\n\nJope sighed and looked around the park as if searching for something to help, somewhere to start, the words to explain the terror.\n\n“A boat has been stolen; an important boat. A yacht of epic proportions, the crown jewel of the frog-ciety we live in today. On this yacht, which is right this moment setting sail from the marina, is a drink more important than any other; a drink that brings life, a drink that takes life. If you and I do not get this boat back, and the drink on it, tonight. Then my whole family, my whole village, will die. This liquid is our life, it is what makes us sentient. Please Mark, will you help me?”\n\nMarks face betrayed his bewilderment and dismay. He felt dismay because despite the hilarity of the situation, he knew there would be no saying no, no turning this frog away to watch his friends and family die. He looked Jope squarely in the eye and slowly nodded.\n\n“Fantastic! Ribbit Rib Ribbit! Stupendous! Brilliant! Ribbit! Weehee!” Jope sprung at Mark and landed on his face, laying sloppy slimy frog kisses all over him. “Let’s go! Run Mark, Run! We must get to the marina!”\n\nStill on the limits of comprehension of his current situation, Mark pushed his questions aside, picked up Jope, and started walking towards the sea.\n\nMark had been living on the streets for many years, and walking wasn’t new to him. The marina wasn’t too far, only about 6km and he knew it would pass under his feet before he even began to understand what was happening.\n\nSoon they neared the marina. Throughout the trip Jope had been squirming with excitement, hopping all over Mark, clinging to him with his suction toes. But as they neared he quietened, and began to look around. It wasn’t long before he spoke up.\n\n“We need a boat to get out to them, there take that one.”\n\nThe frog gestured to a nearby small motorboat with an outboard on it. Mark quickly climbed down without question and began untying the ropes from the jetty. No stranger to crime, often being the only way to survive, Grand Theft Boat was still a bit more than he was used to, but he took action without a word. Jope had grown on him in his hyperactive ways, and he didn’t want any of the frog-ciety to die, he must do anything to help!\nPulling the starter cord on the outboard two or three times, Mark fired the engine into life and quickly powered away from the marina, nervously expecting to hear shouts of alarm at any moment. All was quiet on the shore however as they sped away.\n\n“So what next frog? How do you propose we find this yacht of yours?”\n\n“Oh I know where it is!” Jope replied happily “Just follow the coastline north, we’ll see the lights soon.”\n\nThe frog wasn’t wrong, and it was only a few minutes before the lights from another boat came into view, Mark’s heart rate began to rise as they neared the stolen yacht, fearing conflict and injury, or total failure and the extinction of frog-kind. His limbs trembled with adrenaline, ready for a fight, to help Jope complete his mission.\n\nAs they pulled up alongside the yacht there was no one, frog or human, to be seen on the deck, and only a faint noise of music could be heard from below. Wasting no time, Mark grabbed the railing and pulled himself onto the deck, tensing as the boat swayed slightly with his boarding. \n\nJope nimbly leaped onto the yacht and loudly exclaimed “Quick! This way!”\n\n“Shhhhhh!” whispered Mark, fearful to alert those on board.\n\n“Oh never mind that! Come downstairs! Lets get this drink!” \nJope bounded over to a nearby hatch and disappeared inside it, Mark followed after.\n\nClimbing down a ladder the music got louder and noises of celebration could be heard. Jope was crouched at the door to a room from which the noise was coming and waited for Mark.\n\nMark stepped over to the frog and pushed open the door. Jope leaped across the threshold and yelled at the top of his lungs\n\n“Jooopes here froggies and I’m going to DIE if I don’t get a bourbon in my belly RIGHT NOW!”\n\nLooking around the room in surprise, Mark surveyed about 15 tree frogs, all sitting around the room in groups, all sipping from alcoholic drinks. A real party atmosphere. And what was Jope talking about bourbon for? What about the drink to save frog kind? \n\nAs the pieces slowly slipped together in Marks mind he became angrier and angrier. \n\n“Jope!” He roared, stopping all conversation and turning every pair of round froggy eyes his way. “Explain yourself! I brought you here to rescue a stolen yacht and a drink that all your frogs needed to prevent them from dying! And this seems to be some sort of party!”\n\nJope grinned at Mark.\n“Well, mate, ya see, I just kind of stretched the truth, I needed a drink, of bourbon, badly. And I needed to get to this yacht party. You were my taxi!”\n\nMark scowled “So you were just using me to get across town? There is no danger to frog-ciety, there is no important mission is there?”\n\nJope giggled maniacally as he looked into Marks eyes.\n\n“That’s right Marky me boy! In fact, frogs don’t talk you idiot! You’re still lying on a park bench with a frog on your face!”\n\nBy James Higgins",

    "passage": "Scrubs\n\nScrubs\n\nIn a college cafeteria, a young woman (her friends call her Scrubs) sits at a table and eats her lunch with her eyes unfocused and staring ahead. She sits up straight, even though she looks like she’s going to collapse. She chews her food mechanically. Her light blue nurse’s scrubs are clean and wrinkle free; her white shoes are as bright as the first day she proudly bought them. Her Mom and Pop back home in Kansas would be impressed if they could see her now. She comes from a family of farmers whose education never exceeded high school. Ever since she was a little girl, she dreamt of becoming a nurse in the big city. She traveled from her small town in Kansas full of determination and hope; the things that she’s afraid might disappear since the incident at her apartment building.\n\nShe pushes the incident out of her thoughts for now. She pretends that it never happened. Her life is going perfectly. She has a job that helps her pay for school and she found a boyfriend. His name is Georgeo. “He’s such a caring person,” she thinks to herself. Her and Georgeo went to an animal shelter when they were first dating, and picked out a dog that could keep her company in her lonely apartment. She’s not sure what breed of dog he is, but he has been a loyal companion, she named him Champion. \n\nShe finishes her day at school and is walking towards the bus stop when she gets a call from Georgeo on her cell phone. “Hey, I’m sorry about what happened. I have a surprise that might cheer you up though.” He says.\n\n“An engagement ring!” she thinks to herself. \n\nThey had been seeing each other for months now. He is the kindest, sweetest man she has ever known. She knows that Georgeo was the perfect man for her. She can see him and her growing old together and having children. Her life could be perfect with him, she thought, even more perfect than it is now.\n\n“I can’t wait!” She replied. \n\nOn her way home, she fantasizes about her bright future. When she enters her apartment, Champion does not greet her at the door like he usually does. “Champ’s getting lazy,” she thinks to herself. She puts down her bag and reclines on the couch. She picks up the remote control, points it at the television and presses the button, but there’s no effect. She pushes the button once more; still no effect. She focuses her eyes away from her daydreaming to the television. \nChampion is sitting like a statue before the television in the dark room; his steel-grey eyes are fixed upon her. “What are you doing Champ? Come here boy.” She says. Champion does not move. His eyes are still focused on her in the darkness, unblinking; she can feel him peering into her soul. She turns her head away. “He knows” She thinks, “of course he knows, he was there when it happened.” She slowly opens her mind, letting in the memories of the day of the incident. “Poor Missus Agatha Watson, if only I had paid more attention to her, she might still be alive today. Why did I have such a loose grip?” she repeats over and over in her head. “Maybe if Georgeo hadn’t been flirting with me and my heart was not racing,” she thought. “Only Champion knows that I wasn’t focused while walking Mrs. Watson’s wheelchair. If I were paying more attention, Mrs. Watson wouldn’t have slipped down those stairs. It… it was an accident...”\n\nShe replays the incident in her mind. She was leaving her apartment to take Champion for a walk before her date with Georgeo later that evening. She was thinking about the naughty things that he said to her on the phone earlier, and she was unable to calm herself down. Just as Scrubs was coming out of her apartment, Agatha Watson, the elderly woman in a wheelchair from a couple doors down was coming down the hall, with her feeble, quivering arms struggling to turn the wheels. “Be a dear and push my wheelchair for me,” she called out. \n\n“Sure thing Agatha.” Scrubs replied, and she walked over to the wheelchair.\n\n“Don’t call me Agatha, kiddo. It’s Mrs. Watson to you, and don’t you forget it.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sorry Mrs. Watson.” Scrubs says, as she takes the wheelchair handles and starts to push.\n\n“Say, what are you all dolled up for? A girl doesn’t put on her glad rags just to take her pup for a walk.”\n\n“I, uh, just felt like dressing up today.”\n\n“Says you!” cried Agatha Watson, “you look like you’re on cloud nine. I think you’re stuck on that ragamuffin I’ve seen coming into your apartment. I’ve seen you two necking out here in the hall.”\n\n“You mean—my boyfriend?”\n\n“You’re such a pushover. I’ll bet he’s gonna take you to a petting pantry and afterwards you’re gonna play backseat bingo in his old jalopy. Real original! Any swell daddy would take you out to a ritzy joint no matter how many rubes it costs. Back in my day--” old Agatha Watson kept jabbering on, making archaic criticisms and insults about Scrubs and Georgeo all the way down the hall to the elevator next to the stairs. \n\nThe strangest thing happened when they got to the elevator, something that she can’t forget no matter how hard she tries, Agatha Watson’s wheelchair started to inch toward the stairs. For some reason Scrubs watched it happen, paralyzed in place, she didn’t reach out to stop it. Agatha screamed out with her weak old lady voice as she and her wheelchair flipped end over end down the stairs. The wheelchair and the old lady took turns slamming against the stairs. The wheelchair created loud metallic bangs against the wooden staircase and the old lady just made dull thumps combined with the sound of fracturing bones. Agatha’s scream abruptly stopped halfway through the tumble when her head impacted a step. It all happened in an instant. At the bottom, the body of Mrs. Watson lay pinned under her wheelchair with the side of her face pressed against the floor. When the police questioned Scrubs about it, she said that she found her, already dead, after she heard a commotion in the hall.\n\n“It was an… accident…” she repeats in the darkened room, “I used extra lotion so my hands would be oh so soft when I held hands with Georgeo on our date and the wheel chair just slipped out of my grasp, that’s all… nobody’s fault…” \n\nThe dog was still looking at her. This time he had an incriminatory look in his eyes, as if to say to her, “I know what you did.” \n\n“But it was an accident, Champ. You have to believe me!” She shouted out. She was starting to cry, but Champion’s glare persisted, unblinking. \n\n“Okay, okay, so what if I’m partly to blame?! I didn’t really mean to! I couldn’t move! You were there! You saw! I couldn’t move!” she shouted. \n\nShe remembered back, when the rage built up inside of her as Mrs. Watson talked in the hall. “How dare this uppity witch talk to me this way,” Scrubs thought. “What would happen if this lady just fell down these stairs? Would anyone care? The world would be so much better without this wrinkly old snob in it, maybe I should do everyone a favor.” There was supposed to be a separation of thought and action. It was supposed to only be fantasy. In this case, her fantasy dictated her actions. She pushed Agatha Watson down those stairs and only her and Champion knows the truth. \n\n“I did it, Champion!” Scrubs cries, “I confess! It was my entire fault! I hated the old woman and I wished her dead and it happened. Can’t we just forget about it? Our life is perfect, Georgeo wants to marry me; I know it! Let’s forget it ever happened, it doesn’t make a difference. Don’t let this stand in our way of happiness!” Scrubs tearfully pleaded.\nThe dog’s grey eyes didn’t let up. Champion could see through her, no matter how hard she begged for mercy, he didn’t let go of his hold on her. He sat in the same spot, intently trying to force the evil out of her. \n\nScrubs broke down. She started crying unrestrained. She knew what she had to do. \n\nShe boarded the bus at the stop on the corner. Choking on her tears and shaking with her sobs on the crowded bus, she traveled to the police station where she turned herself in. One policeman was trying to console her, thinking that she was the victim of some horrible crime before she could slow her crying down enough to tell him that she was the one who committed a horrible crime and that she needed to be locked away forever. The police were astounded, but they locked her in a cell nonetheless, based on what she said. \n\n“You get one phone call.” Said a policeman, as he guided her to the phone on the wall. She knew whom she was going to call, Georgeo, to tell him that their future was over. She dialed the number, he picked up, and she explained to him what she had done.\n\n“You what!?” Said Georgeo, completely shocked.\n\n“I killed that old lady in my apartment building… now we can’t ever get married… our future is wrecked, because of me.”\n\n“Whoa there! You killed someone? And what’s this about marriage? Is this some kind of joke? Because it’s not funny.”\n\n“But—that surprise you had for me—wasn’t that an… engagement ring?” \n\n“What!? No. The other day when I came to your apartment and you weren’t there, I found your dog. Dead.” \n\n“That… that doesn’t make any sense. Champion is alive. He’s the reason I’m here in the first place! What does that have to do with my surprise anyway?”\n\n“umm… I thought you knew he was dead at the time… I took the liberty of taking him to a taxidermist, to get him stuffed… as a present. I know how much you loved that dog.” \n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n“I… I have to go now…” whimpered Scrubs, as she carefully put the phone back on the wall. She turned around and slowly walked back into her cell. She had a long, long time to think about what happened, and how her life came to this. \n\n",

The new theme songs will debut in the anime starting in April.\n\nThe characters Nagisa (Mai Fuchigami), Kayano (Aya Suzaki), Karma (Nobuhiko Okamoto), Isogai (Ryota Ohsaka), and Maehara (Shintarō Asanuma) will perform the new opening theme song \"Bye Bye Yesterday.\" The Japanese rock band Frederic wrote the song's lyrics. The same voice actors sang the first opening theme song, \"QUESTION.\"\n\nShion Miyawaki will perform the new ending theme song \"Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi\" (The Day When I Can Meet You Again). She also composed the lyrics. Miyawaki previously performed the first ending theme song, \"Kaketa Tsuki.\"\n\nAn interview with the anime's director Seiji Kishi in Weekly Shonen Jump revealed last month that the anime will cover the manga's final chapter. The manga will end in the magazine's 16th issue, which will ship on March 19.\n\nThe anime's second season premiered on January 7, and Funimation is streaming the series as it airs in Japan. A second live-action film will open in Japan on March 25, and it will also portray the manga's ending.\n\nFour unaired \"Extracurricular Lesson\" episodes premiered on Docomo's dTV streaming service on Friday.\n\nYusei Matsui launched the manga in July 2012. Shueisha shipped the manga's 18th compiled book volume on March 4, and will ship the 19th volume on April 4.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews homepage / archives\n\n-   News\n    -   Convention reports\n    -   Newsfeed\n    -   Interest\n    -   Press Releases\n\n-   Views\n    -   Features\n    -   Reviews\n    -   Columns\n\n-   -   YOUR SCORE for Recent Simulcasts\n    -   Upcoming Anime List\n    -   Upcoming DVD & Blu-Ray\n    -   Weekly Rankings\n    -   Fall 2020 Preview Guide\n    -   Daily Streaming Reviews\n\n-   Encyclopedia\n-   Forum\n-   My ANN\n    -   Subscribe »\n    -   My Anime\n    -   My Manga\n    -   Newsletter\n    -   ANN:Connect\n\n-   -   Our Team\n    -   Contact us\n    -   Staff openings\n    -   Privacy policy\n    -   Copyright policy\n    -   Advertise with ANN\n    -   FAQ\n    -   Report a Problem\n    -   Bugs & Technical Questions Forum\n\n\n",

    "passage": "The Time Traders\n\n_THE TIME TRADERS_ is a science fiction novel by American writer Andre Norton (pseudonym, née Alice Mary Norton), the first in _The Time Traders_ series. It was first published in 1958, and has been printed in several editions. It was updated by Norton in 2000 to account for real world changes. It is part of Norton's Forerunner universe.\n\n_The Time Traders_ introduces the premise: a confrontation between Western heroes and the “Reds”, AKA the Soviets, plus the “Baldies”, a mysterious alien race that has used time travel to alter Earth. This novel alternates among the present day, a trading tribal society in Britain, 2000 B.C., and a glacial outpost in the last ice age.\n\n\nPremise\n\nIn her Time Trader novels Norton tacitly assumes that the physics of time travel differs so significantly from the physics of space travel, especially hyperdrive-propelled interstellar flight, that a civilization that discovers the technology of one simply will not discover the technology of the other. Earth’s physicists have discovered the secret of time travel, but the engineers and scientists who built and use the time transporters have devised a clever way to obtain the secrets of space travel: if it is not possible to discover the secrets, we get them from someone who did.\n\n\nPlot\n\n''The outline below follows the 1958 version;[1] afterward, the changes in the 2000 edition are described.[2]\n\nAt the end of the twentieth century petty criminal Ross Murdock is given the choice of facing a new psychiatric medical procedure called _rehabilitation_ or volunteering to join a secret government project. Hoping for a chance to escape, Ross volunteers to join Operation Retrograde and is taken by Major John Kelgarries to a base built under the ice near the North Pole. Teamed with archaeologist Gordon Ashe, he is trained to mimic a trader of the Beaker culture of Bronze-Age Europe.\n\nSent back to southern Britain around 2000 BCE, Ross and Ashe (as Rossa and Assha) find that their outpost has been bombed, destroyed by the wrath of Lurgha, the local storm god, according to two of the natives. Discovering the direction whence the bomber came and other clues pointing to the general area occupied by the Soviet base, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil, the lone survivor of the bombing, go to that area.\n\nSomewhere near the Baltic Sea, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil begin building a Beaker trading post and learn from the locals that to their southeast lies a land populated by ghosts, a land whither no man of good sense would go. Ross gets separated from Ashe and McNeil in a night attack and must go into the taboo area alone in an effort to find them. Far inside the ghostland he finds the Soviet base and is captured by the Reds.\n\nIn an effort to escape Ross steps onto the base’s transporter plate and is transferred to a Soviet base even further back in time. The Reds recapture him and take him outside the base, abandoning him on a glacier to freeze to death. He climbs out of the crevice into which he was shoved and follows the trail leading away from the Soviet base, coming to a giant globe half buried in the ice. Half dead from the abuse he has received, he enters the globe and then falls through a panel and into a tub full of transparent-red gel.\n\nWhen he regains consciousness Ross discovers that all of his wounds are healed, he is no longer hungry or thirsty, and his Beaker-folk clothing is gone. A mechanism offers him a skin-tight suit made of an iridescent dark-blue fabric that covers all but his head and his hands. He explores what is clearly some kind of ship and is recaptured by the Reds, but not before he activates the ship’s communication system and comes face to face with a hostile-looking humanoid with a large bald head.\n\nThe Reds’ interrogation of Ross is interrupted by explosions that rock the base. Ross is reunited with Ashe and McNeil and the three men escape to the time transporter, pausing only to steal some recording tapes. Back in the Soviet Bronze-Age base, the men leave the time-travel building and escape from the village just as the alien Baldies attack. The men then make their way to the river that will take them to the Baltic Sea to be picked up by their submarine (disguised as a whale).\n\nRoss is again separated from Ashe and McNeil when he falls off their hastily built and uncontrollable raft. He discovers that the Baldies are hunting him when he is captured by warriors from a barbarian tribe. Again he escapes and continues down the river, reaching the sea and the camp occupied by Ashe and/or McNeil only hours after the sub took them away. Two of the Baldies attempt to capture him with telepathic hypnosis, but they flee when Kelgarries and his men arrive. Leaving the alien skinsuit on the beach, so that the Baldies can’t trace the Americans to their base, the men take Ross to the sub and home. There Ashe tells him that the tapes he stole indicate other alien spaceships abandoned on Earth, at least three of them in the Americas. Operation Retrograde is about to become much more interesting and Ross still wants to be part of the action.\n\nChanges in the 2000 edition\n\nThe 2000 version[3] Norton modified the 1958 version by making three changes in the text:\n\n-   She reset the story in the first quarter of the Twenty-First Century instead of in the last quarter of the Twentieth, shifting the action future-ward by a full generation.\n-   The “Reds” have become the Russians and Greater Russia has replaced the Soviet Union.\n-   Space travel has not gone beyond the first lunar landings instead of having not gotten beyond the first attempts to put satellites into orbit. Instead of being ridiculed as impossible, space travel is publicly ridiculed as infeasible.\n\n\nReception\n\nFloyd C. Gale wrote that “_Traders_ gets Miss Norton back solidly and admirably on her track of excellence”,[4] and was one of her “topnotchers”.[5]\n\nIn the _Saturday Review_ for 1958 Nov 01[6] the reviewer, identified by the initials A.

    "passage": "Venice \n\nJonathan parked his car on the far side of the lot in a corner space. Even though there were plenty of spots that were closer to his final destination, he wanted to make sure that no one went near his new car. He contemplated taking two spaces but decided against it because he didn’t want to be that guy. He didn’t want to be a guy that he himself would look down upon. After all it was just a car, why should he inconvenience others? But it was his car. And it was new.\n \nJonathan exited his car and began making his way through the rows of empty spaces in the parking lot. After about twenty strides he finally reached another car, eventually made his way to a sidewalk and began making his way through the park. He checked his watch; it was only 11:40 in the morning. He had twenty minutes to kill before he could begin doing what he came here to do.\n\nJonathan walked along the sidewalk and enjoyed the scenes of the park. The sun beat down on him, as the cloudless sky was so picturesque it could have been on a postcard boasting of the stereotypical weather enjoyed by southern California in the summer time. While it was summer, the day was not exceptionally hot, although Jonathan began to feel beads of sweat form on the back of his neck. A black shirt and jeans may not have been the best outfit to wear outside. \n\nAfter a few minutes Jonathan reached his destination and checked his watch again. 11:43, still seventeen minutes before the Museum of Art opened. Perplexed with what to do, Jonathan began walking around aimlessly, hoping to find something interesting to amuse himself while he waited for the museum to open. He walked along the park, looking at the old buildings and admiring their architecture. But this admiration was fleeting, having seen these buildings numerous times before, their charm and allure was forgotten on Jonathan. \t\n\nWhile walking, Jonathan came across a garden he had never seen before, nestled in between two smaller buildings as a makeshift courtyard. Seeking refuge from the sun that was beginning to wear on Jonathan, he decided to try and find a place to sit and wait until the museum opened. As he walked along the courtyard, he could not find any benches that were not taken by couples, no doubt enjoying the scenery and company of one another that Jonathan was hoping to partake in. Not wanting to make any couple feel unconformable by sitting next to them and possibly ruining their nice moment, Jonathan instead circled the courtyard, no doubt being eyed by the couples wondering why this one man appeared to be seamlessly pacing around the courtyard.\n\nA couple finally obliged and left their bench as Jonathan was walking by. He sat hurriedly on the vacated bench and found himself next to an older woman in a wheel chair and what he presumed to be her daughter. They were talking happily and the older woman seemed happy to be outside. Jonathan sat there for a few minutes, occasionally hearing parts of their conversation while periodically checking his phone to see if he had any messages. He didn’t. \n\nHe repeated this task every so often, not sure what he was hoping to find, but even more unsure about how to act alone in a public place. He felt that the couples were watching him, wondering why he was alone in a very lovely place on a nice day. Jonathan hoped that if people were watching him that by checking his phone maybe they’d think he was trying to get in contact with someone who would meet him at the courtyard, when in reality no one was coming. \n\nHe checked his watch again. 11:56. Four minutes. Jonathan thought about getting up and walking back to the museum, getting there right as it opened. Right as he was about to leave, the older woman and her daughter decide to leave. Perhaps they were going to the museum as well? As the woman was wheeled passed Jonathan, she smiled. He responded with a unsure half smile and a head nod to acknowledge the woman. As he was about to get up, Jonathan realized he couldn’t leave just yet, otherwise the couples watching him might think that he was only there to view the old woman. Why else would he leave right as they were leaving? It couldn’t be coincidence. He’d have to wait an appropriate amount of time before leaving the courtyard, to make it appear that his departure had nothing to do with the old woman in the wheel chair. He would be late for the opening. \n\nJonathan walked into the museum and was immediately receptive to the cool, circulated air. He was much sweatier than he realized after having been outside for almost a half an hour. After showing his member card he was walked past the counter and began to wonder about the museum.  \n\nHe liked coming on Sunday mornings right when the museum opened because there were less people. Unlike those days when membership was free and the museum was turned from a place of refuge with those of intellect into a hall bantered about by mobs of children and inattentive mothers who wanted to do something “cultural” for their children with the hopes that maybe a piece of great art would influence them, when in reality they were just happy to be out of the house. Jonathan disliked these people very much. Not the children, for they didn’t know any better, but the adults who treated his museum as a McDonalds play room. Jonathan only went to the museum once on a “free day” and vowed never to go back again. \t\n\nOn Sundays Jonathan only had to put up with adults who acted inappropriately, talking to loudly, walking in front of him while viewing a work. These acts may seem trivial but Jonathan rather disliked them because of the ease of which they could be avoided, at least among non-oblivious adults. While Jonathan didn’t consider himself an artist or even one who knew a great deal about art, he \nknew what he liked and how to appreciate it. \n\nAs he wondered through the halls he walked into a room and was completely surrounded. He had walked into a room that featured life-sized Buddhists statues, collected from various temples all throughout Southeast Asia. They stood over ten feet tall and towered over Jonathan’s average build. Eight statues filled the room, four on each side of the wall with Jonathan in the middle, alone, being gazed upon by the century old works. He had been in this room dozens of times before, but for some reason felt uncomfortable. He had to leave. \n\nJonathan walked back into the hall from which he just came, unsure of why he felt so strange walking into the exhibit. Part of him thought it was because he was alone and caught off guard by the sixteen carved eyes all focusing on him, while another part wondered if he was burying some deeply guilt within himself that only eight Buddhists statues could reveal. Whatever it was, he didn’t care to find out and made his way into the German expressionist gallery. \n\nJonathan wondered about the first floor of the museum for about an hour, making his way through some new exhibits he hadn’t seen yet. Being impressed with some and disappointed with others, he made his way upstairs to the familiar galleries that hadn’t changed since he became a member many years ago. He walked through the Italian Renaissance gallery and sat down on a bench conveniently placed in front of his two favorite paintings.  \n\nJonathan wasn’t alone in the gallery for very long, as people would occasionally drift in and out, viewing the works and mumbling softly to themselves or others. Occasionally people would stop and view the paintings that Jonathan was admiring. He could see the people out of the corner of his eye at times, watching him, wondering how he could remain so intently focused on just two works for such a long period of time. \n\n“They are breathtaking, aren’t they? These two works,” Jonathan said softly. This is my favorite spot in the whole museum. On the one hand on the left, you have Canaletto painting Venice in such an idealized way. Picturesque. Perfect. How anyone who has ever imagined Venice would view it.  With water so clear and a sky so blue you don’t know which is which. Gondola operators singing in the canals to lovers new and old, their voices echoing off buildings that have seen more history than anyone of us could ever dream. Gloriously crafted buildings that have seen so much, so many lovers and families enjoying the canals, and so many more yet to see! It’s truly remarkable. \n\nAnd on the right side you have Guardi painting Venice for how it really is. Dirty, hazy, the canal littered with merchants and street peddlers trying to make a living. Clogging the beauty of the canal with just unorganized chaos. The buildings lose their luster, as they too are not immune from the damaging effects of the chaos, appearing unkempt and filthy. This is how Venice, I’m sure, actually looked in the 16th century. Not the picturesque scene that we want to see but rather one that is more representative of life. Where people don’t see the beauty around them but rather they can’t because they are just to busy trying to get by. Just trying to survive. \n\nI’ve been trying to survive for a long time now. Jonathan stopped his sentence and looked at the two paintings, putting his hand over his mouth and stroking his chin. He continued speaking. I’ve come here a lot, and I can always tell where I am in life based on which one of the paintings I focus on, the idealized imagery or the gritty reality. And the more I come here, the more I realize I never look at the painting on the left. \n\nJonathan heard a low cough coming from behind him. He looked over and saw a docent, standing in the doorway, with a perplexed look on her face. Jonathan looked around, and saw no one else in the room. He was unsure how long he was talking or if he was even talking to anyone. He felt his face go bright red with embarrassment. He couldn’t think of what to do next. ",

    "passage": "Zhang Liang (Tang dynasty)\n\nZHANG LIANG (; (died April 17, 646[1]) was a Chinese general and official who served as a chancellor late in the reign of Emperor Taizong in the Tang dynasty. He was eventually accused of using witchcraft – a major taboo in imperial China – and executed in 646.\n\n\nBackground and service under Li Mi\n\nIt is not known when Zhang Liang was born. He was from Zheng Prefecture (roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and it was said that his family was not of a noble lineage. Early in his life, Zhang was a farmer, but was said to have great expectations. He was also said to be appearing to be honest and meek outwardly, but instead was treacherous inside. At the end of the Sui dynasty, the rebel ruler Li Mi conquered Zhang's home region, and Zhang followed him. Initially, he was not regarded highly by Li Mi, but after he revealed a treasonous plot to Li Mi, Li Mi believed him to be faithful, and so made him a general and had him serve under the general Xu Shiji.\n\nIn 618, Li Mi was defeated by the Sui general Wang Shichong, and he fled to Tang territory and surrendered to the Tang Empire. The parts of the territory formerly under Li Mi's control was still under Xu's control, and Xu, because Li Mi had already submitted to Tang, decided to submit to Tang as well — a decision that Zhang supported.\n\n\nDuring Emperor Gaozu's reign\n\nAfter the submission of Xu Shiji (who later would be bestowed the imperial clan name of Li and be known as Li Shiji) to Tang, Zhang Liang was made the governor of Zheng Prefecture. However, around the same time, Wang Shichong captured Zheng Prefecture, and Zhang had nowhere to go, and instead took up guerilla warfare in the region. Later, based on recommendations by Li Shiji and Fang Xuanling, the Tang prince Li Shimin (the second son of Emperor Gaozu) invited Zhang to serve on his staff, and Zhang eventually became a trusted advisor.\n\nBy 626, Li Shimin was locked in an intense rivalry with his elder brother, Li Jiancheng (the Crown Prince), and he considered actions to take. As Li Shimin contemplated the possibility that he might eventually need to seize Luoyang to serve as a basis of operations against Li Jiancheng, he sent Zhang to Luoyang, with several thousand men, to secretly plan for that possibility, and to distribute wealth to get people to join Li Shimin's cause. However, this was discovered by Li Shimin's younger brother, Li Yuanji (the Prince of Qi), who supported Li Jiancheng, and Li Yuanji accused Zhang of treason. Zhang was briefly put under arrest, but under interrogation refused to reveal Li Shimin's instructions to him, and with insufficient evidence against himself, he was released and allowed to return to Luoyang. Later that year, after Li Shimin ambushed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate and killed them, he effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong).\n\n\nDuring Emperor Taizong's reign\n\nFor Zhang's contributions, Emperor Taizong enfeoffed him as the Duke of Changping and made him the commandant at Huai Prefecture (, roughly modern Jiaozuo, Henan). In 631, he was made the imperial censor, and then the minister of palace supplies. He was also created the greater title of Duke of Yu. He served several times as commandants, and in 633, when Emperor Taizong made his favorite son Li Tai, the Prince of Wei, the commandant at Xiang Prefecture (, roughly modern Handan, Hebei) but did not actually send Li Tai to Xiang Prefecture, Zhang was made the secretary general at Xiang Prefecture and effectively the commandant. In 637, his title was changed to Duke of Xun.\n\nIt was said that when Zhang was at a prefectural post, he would send his subordinates to secretly investigate who are the good and who are the evil people of the locale, allowing him to punish the evil and discover the good. He was also praised for suppressing the local bullies and helping the weak. However, it was also said that he divorced his wife and married a Lady Li as his new wife. Lady Li was said to be promiscuous and jealous, but was greatly favored by Zhang. When they went to Xiang Prefecture, there was a young man who sold pens for a living and was good at singing and dancing. Lady Li carried on an affair with the young man, and, falsely declaring that Zhang had previously carried on an affair with the young man's mother, encouraging Zhang to adopt the young man as a son, to be named Zhang Shenji () — an act opposed by Zhang's son, by his former wife, Zhang Shenwei (), to no avail. It was also said that Lady Li favored witchcraft, engaging many witches, and interfered with Zhang's administration, and from that point on, Zhang's reputation began to suffer.\n\nIn 640, Zhang was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as the minister of public works. In 641, he was made the head of the household for Emperor Taizong's son and crown prince, Li Chengqian, but was also sent out of the capital to serve as the commandant at Luo Prefecture (i.e., modern-day Luoyang, Henan). The general Hou Junji, who was unhappy that he had been briefly imprisoned on accusations of embezzlement after he conquered Gaochang, tried to instigate Zhang by asking him, “Who squeezed you out?” Zhang, in jest, responded, “Other than you, who can squeeze me out?” Hou responded, “I conquered a kingdom, but I ran into someone throwing a tamper tantrum big enough to overturn a house. What strength do I have to squeeze you out?” He then rolled up his sleeves and yelled, “I am so unhappy that I would rather die. Do you want to commit treason? I will commit treason with you!” Zhang secretly reported this exchange to Emperor Taizong, but Emperor Taizong pointed out that this was a private conversation with no corroboration, and took no action on it.[2] After Hou was revealed to have plotted with Li Chengqian to overthrow Emperor Taizong in 643, Li Chengqian was deposed and exiled, while Hou was executed. Because Zhang had previously warned Emperor Taizong about Hou, Emperor Taizong rewarded him by recalling him to the capital to serve as the minister of justice and also bestowing him the additional designation of _Canyu Chaozheng_ (), making him a _de facto_ chancellor. (Earlier in 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Zhang's was one of the portraits commissioned.) [Zhang Liang's campaign during the Tang-Goguryeo war.] In 644, when Emperor Taizong planned a major campaign against Goguryeo, Zhang repeatedly advised against it, but Emperor Taizong did not accept his advice. Zhang himself thereafter requested to be a general on the campaign, and he was put in charge of the 40,000 soldier fleet that would depart from Lai Prefecture to head directly toward the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang. In summer 645, Zhang's fleet attacked and captured Bisa (, in modern Dalian, Liaoning), and then headed to the mouth of the Yalu River in anticipation of the army also arriving there. When his forces subsequently marched past Geonan (, in modern Yingkou, Liaoning), Goguryeo forces made a surprise attack against his forces—shocking him so much that he froze, but his failure to react was interpreted by his own soldiers to be a show of resolve and bravery, and his assistant Zhang Jinshu () subsequently counterattacked and repelled the Goguryeo attack. Later, however, when Emperor Taizong's own main forces became bogged down in sieging Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) and was eventually forced to abandon the offensive with winter arriving, Zhang withdrew as well.\n\n\nDeath\n\nMeanwhile, over the years, Zhang had taken some 500 men and called them his sons. He had also become very trusting of sorcerers named Cheng Gongying () and Gongsun Chang (), whose brother Gongsun Jie () was one of Zhang's “sons.” Both Cheng and Gongsun flattered Zhang by suggesting that one day he would be emperor. In 646, one Chang Dexuan () reported to Emperor Taizong these things and suggested that Zhang was plotting treason. Emperor Taizong had the chancellor Ma Zhou investigate, and, although Cheng and Gongsun Chang admitted the allegations, Zhang denied the allegations, stating that Cheng and Gongsun only admitted because they wanted to be spared. Emperor Taizong, however, believed that Zhang was plotting with his 500 “sons.” Most officials also advocated Zhang's death; only Li Daoyu () the deputy minister of construction opposed, stating, “There is no firm evidence that Zhang was committing treason, and he should not be put to death.” Emperor Taizong executed Zhang and Cheng, but later regretted it, and due to his regrets, he promoted Li Daoyu to the post of deputy minister of justice.\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n-   _Old Book of Tang_, vol. 69.1\n-   _New Book of Tang_, vol. 94.2\n-   _Zizhi Tongjian_, vols. 191, 194, 196, 197, 198.\n\nCategory:646 deaths Category:Sui dynasty people Category:Tang dynasty generals at war against Goguryeo Category:Chancellors under Emperor Taizong of Tang Category:People executed for witchcraft Category:People executed by the Tang dynasty by decapitation Category:Executed Tang dynasty people Category:7th-century executions by the Tang dynasty Category:Politicians from Zhengzhou Category:Executed people from Henan Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Tang dynasty generals from Henan Category:Tang dynasty politicians from Henan Category:Transition from Sui to Tang\n\n[1] \n\n[2] The _Old Book of Tang_, in Hou's biography, reported this event to be in 643, and the _Zizhi Tongjian_ adopted that dating.

    "passage": "The Time Machine (not the classic story by H.G. Wells, this is an entirely different happening of events altogether. Sorry for any confusion.) Part 1\n\nWhat to do if your dog starts talking to you.\n\tStep one: If he/she is speaking english you still have time to dial a number, and get him/her fixed. If he/she starts speaking german it’s too late. You have to run; then call the number eight-one-one. \n\tStep two: Once you’ve called the number you’ll be picked up in a blue van with racing stripes where you’ll get further instructions.\n\tStep three: Follow said instructions.\n\tNow I know what you’re thinking, “Oh Lane, why would my dog be talking?” My name is Lane by the way, and I don’t like the tone you used to ask that question.  Despite your attitude I’ll answer your question because it’s my job to make sure that you don’t die. Now, I’m not a member of the government or anything like that, but my brother-in-law is. I don’t like him very much, my sister could’ve done better. Anyways, the dog thing, long story actually. If I explain it to you from where I am now it won’t make much sense; actually the whole thing doesn’t make sense, but if I explain it from where I am now it’ll make less sense. So, let’s start from the very beginning.\n\tIt was Friday the thirteenth (I’m not saying the events that will occur have anything to do with the day, but it’s still a freaky coincidence). I was watching Dexter in my ergonomically correct office chair. If you haven’t seen the show here’s the basic rundown: A man works for the forensics unit of the Miami Police Department and he kills serial killers. It’s really good, you should watch it. As I’m in the middle of the twist of the first season my roommate, Charles,  burst in my room wearing headgear from ancient roman times. He didn’t even have to speak because I knew exactly what he was going to say.\n\t“You didn’t!?” I shouted with both fury and aggravation. Wait, aren’t those two kinda the same thing? I don’t think so; well, maybe. I’ll check later.\n\tHe didn’t even answer, he just stared at me with a, ‘Oops, I did it again’ look. You know the one. It’s that look the Olsen twins used on “Full House” whenever their character Michelle did something wrong. I really hate that show. Anyways, he looked at me with that smile and I knew that he used the time machine again. By the way we have a time machine, that’s a totally different story though. I burst out of my chair intending to punch him, but he stopped me.\n\t“Dude just calm down!” Charles said while holding his arms up in self defense.\n\t“We discussed that we wouldn’t use the time machine ever again! It’s getting too dangerous!”\n\t“I couldn’t help it! It was calling my name!”\n\t“Time machines don’t talk, Charles!”\n\t“I’m sorry!” Charles began to wale and cry very obnoxiously so I punched him in the thorax. That always shuts him up.\n\tBefore I explain any further I should tell you about how this even came about. You see, about a week earlier Charles and I had returned from inventing the high five before Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke, we noticed something strange about our basement. Nothing about the placement of objects, all of our guns seemed to be in their usual spots and our extensive collection of L. Ron Hubbard books had remained untouched, but there was some dude standing in the corner of the basement. He didn’t say anything, he just stood there; like a silent, deadly, poltergeist. \n\tHe wasn’t wearing a suit or anything like that, he was wearing a hawaiian shirt with cargo pants and sandals. He appeared to have predominately caucasian ancestry with suspected asian ancestry as well. He was a shady looking dude. What made him especially shady was the AK-47 he was holding in his hands; I was focusing more on the awful shirt he was wearing. There was about thirty seconds of silence until the gun wielding stranger finally spoke.\n\t“You Lane and Charles?” He apparently had a british accent. That’s something neither me nor Charles expected.\n\t“Uh, yeah,” Charles answered hesitantly. The stranger’s fingers tightened around the gun.\n\t“I’m gonna need you to come with me,” he said this very intimidatingly. Charles and I shook with fear, or maybe we were shaking because it was winter in Wisconsin and our basement didn’t have heating. So, we agreed that if his car was heated that we’d go with him.\n\tThe man’s name was Gerald, and his vehicle was a blue van with racing stripes. The interior was not as cool as the exterior. There weren’t any back seats, just plastic crates with pillows on them. The pillows didn’t come in much handy every time we went over a speed bump. There was also no radio, so we couldn’t even jam to some Blue Oyster Cult or Beethoven on this awkward ride. It also wreaked of an awful odor. It was an indescribable smell; I just can’t put into words how bad it smelt in that car, but the smell was probably coming from the rotting corpse that was in the car. We didn’t see the corpse itself, just a bunch of garbage bags. We wouldn’t have guessed that a chopped up corpse was in those bags unless Gerald told us.\n\tGerald, for a man who made Charles and I go on a joyride with him without giving us a reason, was very polite and honest, but he wouldn’t tell us who was in the bags. He merely said it was someone familiar. Gerald was also very cryptic. He was weird like that.\n\tWe drove for about thirty more minutes before we pulled into an abandoned warehouse with about a dozen other blue vans with racing stripes on them.\n\t“Get out,” Gerald said calmly. Like I said, he was polite.\n\tCharles and I got out of the van where we were then attacked and had potato sacks put over our heads. Now, I’m not completey sure about this, but I think these guys gave me and Charles some sort of shot to get us to stop struggling. I say this because for a few minutes I felt like I was flying on a cloud. Not one of those usual clouds you fly on, this one was really nice. It was like flying on cotton candy through a sky where the air I breathed tasted like chocolate. However the ride didn’t last long because whatever Charles and I were injected with wore off and I was greeted with a punch to my face.\n\tThe sack was still on my head so I couldn’t see where I was, but I assumed it was in the same warehouse Gerald pulled his van into because Charles wouldn’t stop screaming and thus echoes ensued.\n\t“Please stop punching my face! It’s very sensitive when blunt objects hit it!” Surprisingly, the men didn’t listen to his request. The sacks were eventually removed from our heads. We were greeted by three men who, by their scrawniness, made Charles and I feel really out of shape that men who looked like that could hurt us so badly. I also noticed that they were wearing the exact same thing that Gerald was wearing. Same hawaiian shirt, sandals, and cargo pants.\n\t“Do you know who we are?” The man in the middle said. The men never gave us their names, so I’m just gonna call them Larry, Curly, and Tom Cruise.\n\t“No, why would we know that?” Charles asked.\n\t“Because you might’ve seen us when you visited King Tut last week,” responded Tom, “or when you proved Joseph Smith wrong a year ago, or when you invented the high five an hour ago.”\n\tWoah, these guys were good. I was surprised that he knew of mine and Charles’ time adventures. We were the only people in the world with a time machine. Or at least, in our time. Charles had a look on his face that was all too familiar to me. It was the look that said, “I’ll get us out of here, just let me go over every Doctor Who episode I’ve ever seen and see if the Doctor has been in a similar situation.” As his face of clever thinking deteriorated to that of a distressed puppy I knew we were in trouble.\n\t“We’ve been watching you for quite some time now,” Curly said out of no where. He didn’t really look like someone who’d talk, “and we don’t appreciate what you’ve been doing.”\n\t“What’re you talking about?” I asked.\n\t“You’ve been unknowingly destroying Earth.” Larry responded.\n\tCurly then made a hologram of Earth appear on some sort of device that wasn’t supposed to be around until 2050. Charles and I took some future vacations as well. As we looked at our amazing planet several red dots began to appear all over it, mostly in North America and Europe.\n\t“These are all the spots where the aliens have already invaded!” Curly shouted causing me and Charles to jump a little bit. \n\tI’ll spare you the one hour speech that was given to Charles and I, but I will tell you what you need to know: Apparently Charles and I had used our time machine so much that it got the attention of shapeshifting extra-terrestrials due to some signal it was giving off. Since time machines weren’t supposed to be around until five years from now when we’d already made peace with a different species of aliens made mine and Charles’ time machine very suspicious. Like I said, how we got that time machine was a different story altogether. Apparently the species that we were supposed to make peace with eliminated the species that was currently inhabiting Earth. Now you see the dilemma, don’t you? Oh yeah, it turns out that Gerald, Larry, Curly, and Tom Cruise were sent from the future to stop us from causing the aliens to invade. They obviously didn’t do a good job. Also, they were wearing the same things because their future space uniforms adapted to the time period they were in. Now I remember why I don’t write, I forget to put important plot points in.\n\tThey left it up to me and Charles to not use the time machine anymore; because if we did the aliens, species name: Dorothrats, would get a lock on signal and use the time machine for evil. Why they left it up to us I have no idea, we would probably do a worse job than them. They should’ve just taken it away from us. They also said we were a part of their Alliance or whatever, so now we had to help people with whatever kind of alien problems they had. Apparently there had been a lot of calls like that. People calling about their dog talking. The Alliance was always listening in on phone calls so they could show up on the scene before things got out of hand. \n\tApparently, Dorothrats invade by taking the shape of dogs, learning how earthlings interact and live, and then they transform into humans. This wasn’t a fast process though; the educating stage could take weeks or months. And the transformation, that’s what the beginning of my story was about. Dorothrats first learn how to speak our language, which is english if you didn’t know, this is the early stage in the transformation process, so you can still get him/her fixed if you hear a strange whisper in the middle of the night. By fixed I mean beaten to death. It’s okay, they’re not really dogs, they’re aliens so it’s not animal cruelty. However, once they learn another language, (no one knows how they do it, but they do), then it’s too late for you. Your dog will then turn into your shape, kill you, and begin living your life. Huh, I guess I didn’t shorten that speech at all.\n\tAnyway, Gerald dropped Charles and I back off at our house and said to be ready for a call. We never would be. And those are the events leading up to Charles and the roman headgear.\n\t“Do you have any idea what you’ve done?!” I shouted.\n\t“I’m sorry man! What’s the worst that could actually happen?”\n\tBefore I could answer my phone rang. It was Gerald. How did he get my number? I don’t remember him asking for it. Oh yeah, they were time travelers. I answered it, all he said was, “You really messed up. Go to 1233 3rd avenue, your first assignment is there.” The call ended. I gave Charles a dead stare, but I couldn’t focus on his mistake. We had an assignment.\n",

    "passage": "David Colquhoun, professor of pharmacology at University College London for 30 years, has lately led a double life. In his day job, he has pioneered painstaking research into the binding properties of molecules and contributed extensively to understanding the particular influences on ion channel function in the development of drugs. In his after-hours alter ego, however, he is the take-no-prisoners scourge of quackery and mumbo-jumbo in his unmissable blog, DC's Improbable Science.\n\nFor a decade or more, no homeopath or acupuncturist has been safe from Professor Colquhoun's scathing, and often comic, online analysis. No newspaper report of the latest carcinogen – sausages or coffee or cheese – can survive his statistical scrutiny. He wages rigorous war against the march of managerialism and corporate speak through academia and the NHS. And, at 76, you would have to say he rather enjoys it.\n\nSitting in his office at UCL, surrounded by shelves of box files yellowed with the smoke of the pipe that was always a necessary accompaniment to his algebra, he dwells with some amusement on the two halves of his public life. \"I once wrote a textbook on statistics, which has been enormously useful to me in many ways,\" he says. \"But that book, though pretty well received, sold 5,000 copies over several years. The latest blog I did on the Department of Health had 7,000 hits in three days. I have to say it is fun to have a big audience. All my life, I have been writing papers that have been read by a handful of people around the world. I love the science and I remain addicted to stochastic processes, but to write something that gets picked up on Twitter and has an immediate response is a different kind of addiction. If I get asked to go to a university these days to speak they ask me to do a seminar on ion channels and another on management gobbledegook or something. One gets a dozen committed students, the other fills a large lecture hall…\"\n\nThe General Medical Council currently requires all medical students to be familiarised with alternative medicine as part of their studies. Some universities apparently ask practising homeopaths to conduct this briefing; others, such as King's in London, invite Colquhoun. \"I tend,\" he says, with a guffaw, \"to give them a version of my 'Patient's Guide to Magic Medicine', which was originally written as a response to the witterings of the Prince of Wales on the subject.\"\n\nColquhoun's guide is a _Devil's Dictionary_ of all things holistic: \"Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety… Reflexology: plain old foot massage, overlaid with utter nonsense about non-existent connections between your feet and your thyroid gland… Spiritual healing: tea and sympathy, accompanied by arm-waving… Kinesiology, iridology, vega test, etc: various forms of fraud, designed to sell you cures that don't work, for problems you haven't got.\" And so on.\n\nColquhoun has lately won a series of victories against what he calls the \"endarkenment\" of healthcare. After lodging a freedom of information request, he obtained the background correspondence from the prince's homeopathic charity that apparently influenced the creation of an infamous page on alternative treatments on the NHS Choices web page. Colquhoun subsequently gained an admission that the advice had \"let down the general public\" and a reworking of the page to include the wording: \"There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition…\" Also long in his sights have been the universities that offer MSc qualifications in anti-science. \"I discovered for example that 'amethysts emit high yin energy' was being taught as part of a BSc at Westminster just down the road.\" As a result of the attention brought by his blog, science degrees in homeopathy are a thing of the past in British universities.\n\nInevitably, none of this has been achieved without some fallout. After protracted complaints by one herbalist to the provost of UCL, Colquhoun was quietly, and outrageously, asked to remove his blog from the university site in 2007. When he did so, \"all hell broke loose\" after a column by Ben Goldacre in the _Guardian_ exposed the academic cowardice of the university hierarchy. No stranger to lawyers, Colquhoun now worries that unless the much-debated defamation bill is passed, legitimate scientific opinion will continue to be suppressed by anyone with money.\n\nAt the same time, he hopes that the \"fashion for irrationality\", which he dates back to the Beatles going to India \"when flower power stopped being fun and started being mystical bollocks\", may be fading. His abiding hero is Bertrand Russell, and he laces his conversation with favourite quotes, including Russell's maxim that \"it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true\".\n\nColquhoun ascribes some of his critical scepticism to his father, the only boy from Birkenhead to get a scholarship to Liverpool University in his year in the 1920s, who went on to become a schoolmaster, teaching languages to Harold Wilson and the geneticist Steve Jones among others. Colquhoun was hopeless at school and started to make his mark as an academic only after a miserable couple of years as an apprentice pharmacist in a branch of Timothy Whites & Taylors chemists in Birkenhead.\n\nHaving eventually gained tenure at UCL in the 60s, he devoted himself to solving the \"affinity-efficacy problem\". This dwelt on the idea that if \"drug design is to become rational, it is essential to be able to measure separately the binding affinity of the drug for its receptor and the effectiveness of the drug in opening an ion channel once it has bound\".\n\nThe only way to solve the problem was by measurement of single molecules. In collaboration with Alan Hawkes, the necessary mathematics was worked out for the interpretation of experiments done initially with Bert Sakmann, who, with Erwin Neher, got the Nobel prize in 1991 for discovering how to record from single molecules. \"I don't think drug design will become fully rational in my lifetime,\" Colquhoun says. \"But I have tried to make a small contribution to that long-term goal.\"\n\nHe doesn't link the two halves of his career very closely in his own mind, but talking to him you can see clearly how one has fuelled the other. Having spent half a lifetime trying to establish the smallest conceivable causalities at the molecular level, you can well imagine his righteous frustration when policy-makers disregard evidence-based models entirely in putting forward advice in relation to health or diet or anything else.\n\n\"People simply still don't get that to prove 'effect B' is caused by 'intervention A', you have to use randomised controlled testing,\" he says.\n\nIn his current semi-retirement, Colquhoun was hoping to complete a book on the mathematical and statistical principles of pharmacology, but he worries the sheer irrationality of the world might yet prevent him. \"There is so much to do on the blog,\" he says, both cheerfully and guiltily, \"that I fear that might get in the way…\"\n\n\nTEN QUESTIONS FOR David Colquhoun\n\nWHAT IS THE MOST EXCITING FIELD OF SCIENCE AT THE MOMENT?\n\nToo often what's trendy now turns out not to live up to its promise. Predictions are impossible: that's why it's called research.\n\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN A GOD?\n\nNot since I was 15. A nurse took me to an Easter mass, which struck me as a sadomasochistic orgy (of course I didn't know then that so many priests acted out their perversities). I'm with Steven Weinberg when he said: \"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil – that takes religion.\"\n\nWHAT BOOK ABOUT SCIENCE SHOULD EVERYONE READ?\n\nFiction: George Eliot's _Middlemarch_. Nonfiction: Bertrand Russell's _On the Value of Scepticism_.\n\nWHAT WORDS OF ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A TEENAGER WHO WANTS A CAREER IN SCIENCE?\n\nLive your dream, and stick to your principles. But be realistic about career prospects. At the moment they are lousy.\n\nDO YOU HAVE A FANTASY EXPERIMENT OR STUDY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO FOR LOGISTICAL/ETHICAL/COST REASONS?\n\nNo. Single ion channel biophysics is cheap compared with many areas. The limitation is my brain, not cost.\n\nWHAT SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE WOULD MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE TO YOUR DAILY LIFE?\n\nFactors that limit my daily life are not to do with lack of science (unless you count the inability of medicine to fix my spine).\n\nOUTSIDE OF YOUR WORK, DO YOU LIVE AN EVIDENCE-BASED LIFE?\n\nYes, I think so. The exception is my pipe, without which I can't do algebra (or much else).\n\nWHY DO SO FEW SCIENTISTS ENTER POLITICS?\n\nBecause science is one of very few occupations where you can put honesty above expediency (though even in science that doesn't always happen). That being said, the lack of scientific education among politicians is scary. Can you imagine a minister of education referring to \"Newton's laws of thermodynamics\", or giving taxpayers' money to schools that believe in karma and gnomes? Michael Gove has done both.\n\nWHO DESERVES A NOBEL PRIZE?\n\nThat's always contentious. I suspect that big prizes cause more misery than happiness, and do nothing to improve science.\n\nIF I CALLED YOU A GEEK WOULD YOU HOLD IT AGAINST ME?\n\nNot in the least.\n",

    "passage": "The Coup - And a Salvation\n\nRed dirt littered the outside of the Land Cruiser as we rolled down the unpaved road. Smoke billowed from beyond some of the buildings, and we knew exactly what it was from.\n\n\"Do these niggers really think what they're doing will help?\" Jonah said from the passenger seat. \"How can they truly believe this can change anything?\"\n\nI kept my gaze on the road and my left hand firmly on the wheel. The coup had started, and we were in charge of the ambassador's escort. The embassy was still another five-minute drive, and since the mobs were blocking the roads and lighting tires on fire, we would probably have to change our course once or twice.\n\n\"I don't agree with the tactics,” I said, “but I can empathize with them. They want an opportunity. Just a chance at a life where they don't have to wake up hungry.”\n\nJonah rolled his eyes. \"What the fuck does that mean? And you're only saying that because you grew up here! Damn sympathizer! You're emotionally attached to these... these... people. That's what gets your ass killed, bro.\"\n\n\"I'm not attached. It's more of a respect. I know many of them personally. They're good people.\"\n\n\"Good people my ass.”\n\nOur argument was postponed as we both noticed black smoke pouring from a group of locals down the road. I slowed down as I neared them, hoping to find an avenue of escape, but just as I noticed a hole, the group hurried to throw a few tires and douse them in gasoline. I brought the vehicle to a stop and put it in reverse. A few of the men from the mob ran at us and slammed their machetes against the metal hood of the Land Cruiser. One man threw a rock and barely missed the driver's mirror.\n\n\"Find me another route, Jonah,\" I exclaimed as the vehicle's engine revved and threw us backwards.\n\n\"You can turn right here. I don't see any smoke this way, hopefully these fuckers haven't hit the alleys yet,\" Jonah said as he messed with the GPS.\n\nI whizzed down the side road as quickly as the SUV could, hitting bumps and unintentionally testing the suspension system. My view to the rear was a barrage of red dust, and if we were being followed, I couldn’t tell.\n\nA thin man came running into the road and forced me to slam on my breaks. Jonah hit his face on the dash, and cursed a few times with my name in mind.\n\n\"You don't stop. Don't ever fucking stop!\" Jonah yelled.\n\n\"I know him,\" I exclaimed. \"Samuel! Samuel, it's me!”\n\nThe man stopped running and jogged over to the car. \"My friend, I am so glad,\" Samuel said through a bright white smile. \"I did not know if you were not going to get through. Many people out here is very violent right now.\"\n\n\"Get in!\" I said, slapping the outside of the door a couple times.\n\nSamuel jumped into the back seat and pulled the door closed. He put his seatbelt on, as I pressed back down on the accelerator.\n\nJonah held his brow, \"Am I bleeding?\"\n\n\"No you're good,\" I proclaimed eyeing him for a half second.\n\n\"My friends, it is not good out there. The radio say that the president is dead. General Sanogo is now the man, and he say Americans is why the famine is real bad.\" Samuel's face looked worried. \"I do not believe this. But my friends, are you leaving now?\"\n\n\"Yes thank god, sick of this fucking place,\" Jonah said still holding his forehead.\n\n\"We're trying, Samuel, but we have to get to the embassy first. We won't leave without the ambassador,\" I said looking Samuel in the eyes through the mirror.\n\nWe kept dodging the blocked roads, which forced us to take back roads. We passed soldiers with AK's, and heard bullets ringing into the air every few minutes. No one had shot at us yet, but if they did, all we had were our issued handguns, and five magazines of ammunition each. We needed to get to the embassy so we could suit up, and face the challenges head on. My primary job was that of the translator. I spoke English and French fluently, and spoke a few phrases of the several dialects of the area. Secondly, I was the radio operator. And I would have had my radio equipment with me, but we had been sent out on short notice earlier in the morning to search for a specific American student that lived in town near the market. Our task had failed, he wasn't there, and the two-bedroom loft had been ransacked. We hoped that he had found a way out, and hadn't been grabbed by the mob.\n\nI grabbed my water canteen from the cup holder and held it over my right shoulder. \"Samuel, drink buddy, you're still breathing hard!\"\n\n\"Merci mon ami,\" Samuel said as he grabbed the bottle and took a few gulps.\n\nJonah turned his head towards Samuel. \"What did he say? You know I don't speak French!\" Jonah directed at me.\n\n\"Chill. He said 'thank you my friend'.\" I explained using my right hand to push the stick into second gear as we turned a sharp corner. \"Samuel and I have been friends for many years. Samuel taught me to play soccer, and how to fish using just a line.\"\n\nSamuel laughed, \"Yes I remember. You got scared one day because a crocodile came near so... so you ran home. You wouldn't come back for three days,\" Samuel chuckled and emphasized the day count with three fingers in the air.\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\"Just shut up guys,\" Jonah exclaimed. \"This isn't the time.\"\n\nIt was true, it wasn't the time for us to be reminiscing on the past, but for those few seconds, it sure felt good to remember.\n\n\"Take this next left,\" Jonah said. \"It's gonna lead us back onto a main road and I don't see any smoke in the sky, so hopefully it's clear.\"\n\nI took the turn, and about 500 meters in front of us was a group dancing in the road. They had their machetes up, and a few soldiers waved their AK rifles in the air. I screeched to a stop, and as I turned the vehicle around, we must have hit a nail, or a broken beer bottle, because the right front tire blew, throwing the rim onto the rocky ground. The mob had already noticed us, they chanted and sang, and did it while nearing us at an increasing pace. We all jumped out of the car, and looked around for an escape. The open road was not an option because we knew farther back the masses would be on their way.\n\n\"This way, this way.\" Samuel yelled at Jonah and I as we both checked our weapons. He had found an alley between two cement buildings and it seemed to lead to another road. \n\nBy now, the mob was at a full sprint. Their cries were no longer that of freedom, but had turned to hate and anger. I knew that they believed full heartedly in what the radio had said, and that they would have no mercy on us.\n\n\"We're behind you. Go!\" Jonah told Samuel as he ran behind the African man.\n\"Coming,\" I yelled out bringing up the rear.\n\nWe turned a few corners, sprinting as fast as we could. This labyrinth of cement walls had to lead somewhere. We could hear the mob getting closer and we heard bullets being shot off as we ran into the alley. Samuel was still in the lead, and he turned and weaved like a professional escape artist. We just did our best to stay on his heels. He gained a small lead on Jonah and I, but we still followed.\n\nStop.\n\nWe turned a corner, and Samuel was stopped. He stood with his hands on his head facing a cement wall blocking our path. It was quite tall, and way too high for one person to reach the top.\n\n\"Help each other up! I will calm them. I will tell them you are not to fault!\" Samuel exclaimed confidently waving both of us towards the wall. Breathing heavily, he turned back towards the path where the mob would soon be visible.\n\n\"No. Samuel, come with us right now, we can get all three of us up and over this wall. We will have time.\" I yelled at Samuel who was already facing away from us.\n\n\"Samuel, come on. You don't need to do this,\" Jonah yelled. \n\nI grabbed Jonah by the shoulder. \"Let's go get the ambassador.\"\n\nSamuel looked back one last time. \"It will be alright. Goodbye my friends.\"\n\nI nodded thankfully at Samuel, and knelt down to allow Jonah to use my knee as a foothold.\n\nWe made it over the wall, and just in time. We heard the cries as they reached the wall. And then everyone went quiet. Samuel was yelling at them and speaking to them in \nFrench.\n\n\"What's he saying?\" Jonah whispered.\n\n\"He said 'they are not at fault', and I even think he said we were Canadian. He is telling them that we were here to help the people.\"\n\nThe people started shouting out again. It was hard to tell what they were saying, but whatever it was, it wasn't peaceful. Then a man hushed the crowd, and eventually, his voice was the only one readable.\n\n\"Mon homme, je suis officier pour le général, où sont les blancs?\" The man said. \"Le général veut leur parlé!\"\n\n\"I work for the general,” I translated, “where are the whites, the general wants to speak with them.”\n\n\"Sont pas là!\" Samuel protested, allowing his courage to be tested.\n\n\"They ar...\" I started.\n\n\"I got that part,\" Jonah interrupted me putting his finger up asking for silence.\n\nA few of the members started yelling, and soon everyone was in an uproar.\nThe man hushed the crowd again. \"Traître, tue le!\"\n\nThe crowd went wild.\n\nA tear formed in my eye. \n\nJonah noticed. \"What? What is it?\"\n\n\"They killed him.\" I muttered. “Why would he give his life for us?”\n\n“I don’ know,” Jonah answered. “I didn’ even respect ‘im.  But he, was a good man.”\n",

    "passage": "Tennessee Republican Party\n\nThe TENNESSEE REPUBLICAN PARTY (TRP) is the affiliate of the United States Republican Party in Tennessee. It is often called the Tennessee Grand Old Party or the TNGOP.\n\n[Governor Bill Lee ]\n\n\nHistory\n\nUpon its entry into the Union in 1796 Tennessee was strongly Democratic-Republican. Tennessee became a two-party system for more than 20 years during the Jacksonian era. The Democratic Party was formed by Jackson followers and this party was dominant against the rival Whig Party led by Henry Clay. But in 1835, there was a turn in power of party and a Whig governor was elected. Tennessee after the Civil War was part of the Democratic South for about a century. East Tennessee however remained strongly Republican. Even though the state was predominantly Democratic two different presidential elections won the state of Tennessee in 1920 and 1928. In the 1960s and 1970s Republicans made a push into the Democratic power when in 1966, Howard Baker was elected US senator. Then again Republicans made another push, when Winfield Dunn was elected governor, the first Republican Governor in over 50 years.[1]\n\n\nLeadership and staff\n\nThe Tennessee Republican Party has had five chairmen since 2005. On December 11, 2004, the State Executive Committee unanimously elected Bob Davis[2] as Chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party to serve for the calendar years 2005 and 2006. He was subsequently elected to a second two-year term, 2007 and 2008, but resigned from the chairmanship in August 2007 to become Senior Adviser to presidential candidate Fred Thompson. The party's State Executive Committee then chose Robin Smith,[3] former chairman of the Hamilton County Republican Party and vice chairman of the Tennessee GOP under Davis, to complete Davis's two-year term.\n\nRepublicans won a historic victory in Tennessee's 2008 elections, when the party won majorities in both houses of the Tennessee General Assembly for the first time since the Reconstruction Era election of 1868. Smith was unanimously re-elected at the end of 2008 to a full two-year term as chairman for calendar years 2009 and 2010. In April 2009, Smith announced her resignation in order to run for Congress in Tennessee's 3rd congressional district in the August 2010 Republican primary.[4]\n\nStaff\n\n-   The Chairman of the Republican Party of Tennessee is Scott Golden, who was elected on December 3, 2016.[5] Michael Sullivan serves as Executive Director and Candice Dawkins as Operations Director.\n\n\nCurrent elected officials\n\nThe Tennessee Republican Party controls the governor's office and a majority in the Tennessee Senate and the Tennessee House of Representatives.

Paul Stanley was known for running for family values.[10] Stanley resigned because he wanted to focus more on his family and better that since his indiscretions.

    "passage": "Andrew Birkin\n\nANDREW TIMOTHY BIRKIN (born 9 December 1945) is an English screenwriter, director and occasional actor. He was born the only son of Lieutenant-Commander David Birkin and his wife, actress Judy Campbell. One of his sisters is the actress and singer Jane Birkin.\n\n\nWork\n\nBirkin was educated at Elstree School and Harrow School. At the former he was remembered by a teacher as being “one of the naughtiest boys ever to have passed through Elstree”[1] and his record at Harrow was no better. He left school at the age of 17 to work as a mail boy at 20th Century Fox's London office, graduating to Elstree Studios as a production runner in 1963 on _Man in the Middle_ and _The Third Secret_. After hitch-hiking and freight-jumping across America in 1964, he returned to England in 1965 and began work as a runner on Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_, but soon became Kubrick's location scout.[2] By the summer of 1966, Kubrick had promoted Birkin to Assistant Director on Special Effects;[3] Birkin later proposed the shooting and colour transposition of aerial footage for the 'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite' sequence. Kubrick dispatched him to Scotland with cameraman Jack Atcheler and a 65mm Panaflex camera bolted to the floor of an Alouette helicopter; but Atcheler soon quit the enterprise, deeming Birkin to be reckless. Birkin continued alone and shot most of the resulting footage himself.[4][5][6] In 1967 Birkin supervised the shooting of 'The Dawn of Man' front projection plates in the Namib Desert.[7][8][9]\n\nAfter working as First Assistant Director to the Beatles on _Magical Mystery Tour_ in 1967, Birkin served as Location Manager on _Play Dirty_ in Spain before again working for Stanley Kubrick, this time as his assistant director and location scout on his unmade epic of Napoleon.[10][11][12] Following second unit directing work on _Melody_, Birkin began writing scripts for producer David Puttnam, including _The Pied Piper_ (1971) for director Jacques Demy,[13] _Slade In Flame_ (1974) for the rock band Slade (which won the Vision Award at the 2007 MOJO Awards, and was described as the “Citizen Kane of rock musicals” by BBC film critic Mark Kermode [14]), and an unmade adaptation of Albert Speer's _Inside the Third Reich_ for Puttnam and Paramount, which involved a year's collaboration and taped interviews with Speer in 1972.[15][16]\n\nHaving worked on an adaptation of _Peter Pan_ for NBC in 1975, Birkin conceived and wrote _The Lost Boys_ (1978), a 3-part mini-series for the BBC about Peter Pan's creator J.M. Barrie, which won him writing awards from the Writers Guild of Great Britain and the Royal Television Society. The critic Sean Day-Lewis wrote in the _Daily Telegraph_, 'I doubt if biography has ever been better televised than in this sensitive and beautifully crafted masterpiece, and I am quite sure such excellence is beyond any other television service in the world.'[17] The BBC's Director-General Sir Ian Trethowan called it 'a landmark in television drama'.[18] Birkin has also written a biographical account of Barrie's relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family, _J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys_ (1979; 2nd edition 2003), described by _The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature_ as 'the most candid and perceptive biography to have been written of Barrie'.[19] Birkin also hosts Barrie's official website on behalf of the Great Ormond Street Hospital, to whom he donated his Barrie/Llewelyn Davies/Peter Pan archive in 2004.[20]\n\nIn 1980, Birkin won a BAFTA award and an Academy Award nomination for his short film _Sredni Vashtar_, based on the short story by Saki, which he wrote, produced and directed for 20th Century Fox. In 1984 he wrote the shooting script for _The Name of the Rose_ (in which he also had a small acting role), and in 1988 he wrote and directed _Burning Secret_, based on the novel by Stefan Zweig, which won two awards at the 1989 Venice Film Festival, as well as the Young Jury prize for Best Film at the Brussels Film Festival. In 1993, Birkin wrote and directed _The Cement Garden_, based on the novel by Ian McEwan, for which he won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the Berlin Film Festival,[21] as well as Best Film at several film festivals, including Dinard, Fort Lauderdale, and Birmingham.[22] In 1998 he collaborated with Luc Besson on the script of _The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc_, and in 2004 co-wrote the screenplay for _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer_.\n\nIn 2013, Taschen published a selection of his photographs and an autobiographical essay in _Jane & Serge: A Family Album_. In 2017 he wrote an adaptation of Peter Pan for Radio France.\n\n\nPrivate life\n\nBirkin has four sons and a daughter. David Birkin (born 1977), artist and photographer, is his eldest son, followed by Anno Birkin (1980–2001), poet and musician, and Ned Birkin (born 1985), whom Birkin directed in _The Cement Garden_. He is married to artist Karen Birkin, with whom he has a daughter, Emily Jane (born December 2008) and a son, Thomas Bernie (born April 2011). Two of his nieces are actresses: Charlotte Gainsbourg, who also appeared in _The Cement Garden_, and Lou Doillon.\n\nHe lives on the Llŷn Peninsula in North Wales.\n\nBirkin is a trustee of the children's arts charity Anno's Africa.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n-   _The Pied Piper_ (writer)\n-   _Slade in Flame_ (writer, Mojo Vision Award winner, 2007)\n-   _Peter Pan_ (1976 musical) (co-writer)\n-   _ The Thief of Baghdad_ (1978) (writer)\n-   _The Lost Boys_ (writer, won Royal Television Society Award for Best Writer, Writers Guild of Great Britain Award)\n-   _Omen III: The Final Conflict_ (writer, associate producer)\n-   _Sredni Vashtar_ (writer, producer, director, winner of BAFTA Award for Best Short Film, 1981; nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Film, Live Action)\n-   _King David_ (co-writer)\n-   _The Name of the Rose_ (co-writer)\n-   _Burning Secret_ (writer, director; winner of Young Jury Prize, Brussels Film Festival, 1989)\n-   _Salt on Our Skin_ (co-writer with Bridget Gilbert; director)\n-   _The Cement Garden_ (writer, director; winner of Silver Berlin Bear for Best Director, 1992; nominated for Golden Berlin Bear; winner of the Golden Hitchcock at the Dinard Festival of British Cinema; nominated for Best Film at Mystfest)\n-   _The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc_ (co-writer with Luc Besson)\n-   _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer_ (co-writer)\n\n\nBooks\n\n-   Author, _J.

    "passage": "NIR Class 450\n\nThe '''Class 450 ''' was a type of diesel multiple unit (DMU) formerly used by Northern Ireland Railways. They were affectionately nicknamed 'Thumpers' and 'Castles' (also known as the Castle Class) by rail enthusiasts.\n\n\nHistory\n\n[451 passing in 1986] [458 at Hilden] In the mid 1980s, Northern Ireland Railways was in the process of upgrading its rolling stock. Having already purchased three new locomotives, it then proceeded to purchase replacements for its Class 70 diesel multiple units. A total of nine three car trains were constructed by British Rail Engineering Limited between 1985 and 1987 intended to supplement the existing Class 80 DMUs then in service. The trains were constructed using underframes of existing Mark 1 coaching stock, altered to and new Mark 3 bodyshells. Because of this, they bore a strong resemblance to the British Rail Class 150, British Rail Class 210, British Rail Class 317, British Rail Class 318 and British Rail Class 455, as they use Mark 3 bodyshells. These were combined with refurbished power units and traction motors from the withdrawn Class 70 units (there were only eight Class 70 units available to be salvaged, so the equipment for the ninth train came from a withdrawn Class 80 train, powercar 88 that was damaged at a collision at Hilden.)\n\nThe power cars of the Class 450 units were named after various Northern Irish castles.[1] They entered service in a cream, orange, and red livery.\n\nOn Thursday 9 March 1995, a 450 Class train was used to form a royal train when Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the Dargan Bridge, composed of two cars from 455 coupled to two cars from 459.\n\nThe Class 450 operated on the same principle as the prototype Class 210 DMUs on the British network, in that they consisted of a single power car containing the traction and generating equipment (numbered 45x), an intermediate trailer car (numbered 79x) and a driving trailer (numbered 78x) as permanently formed 3 car sets. An additional “8” was added to the start of all the cars so that they could be used by Translink's computer system.\n\nIn 2005, the entire fleet underwent an extensive refurbishment to bring them up to a similar standard to the newly introduced Class 3000 units, enabling them to remain in service for at least another 5 to 7 years.[2] This took them up to the point where they became “life-expired.”[3]\n\nIn 2011, the entire Class 450 fleet, together with the remaining Class 80 units, was listed by NI Railways for disposal.[4]\n\nCurrent status\n\nThe entire Class 450 fleet was withdrawn from service in 2012, following the arrival of enough Class 4000 units to displace the 450 units serving the Larne Line and Portrush branch. Eight out of the nine units have been cut up for scrap. The sole remaining example has been purchased for preservation by the Downpatrick and County Down Railway.\n\n  Key:   bgcolor=lightgrey |Scrapped   bgcolor=lightskyblue |Preserved\n  ------ ----------------------------- ---------------------------------\n\n  Number   Power Car Name           Intermediate Number   Driving Trailer Number   Status      Notes\n  -------- ------------------------ --------------------- ------------------------ ----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  451      _Belfast Castle_         791                   781                      Scrapped    Cut up at York Road.

By the year of their withdrawal, the Class 450 units had mostly been relegated to weekday services on the Larne Line and the Portrush Line shuttle, however at weekends there were enough Class 3000 trains to operate these services.\n\nThe gradual entry into service of the Class 4000 trains in 2012 saw the Class 450 units each displaced by a new Class 4000 unit as one became available, until they were all finally withdrawn.\n\n\nFleet details\n\n  Class       Operator                    No. Built   Year Built   Cars per Set   Unit nos.\n  ----------- --------------------------- ----------- ------------ -------------- -----------\n  CLASS 450   Northern Ireland Railways   9           1985-1987    3              451 – 459\n\n\nIn Preservation\n\nOne example of the class has been preserved, by the Downpatrick & County Down Railway. Unit 458 _Antrim Castle_ was moved by road from York Road Depot, Belfast, over the weekend of 27–28 September 2014. During a two-day operation, the set was split into Driving Trailer, Intermediate and Power Car at Belfast and then, one-by-one, the carriages were taken by lorry to Downpatrick where they were reassembled. The Driving Trailer arrived on 27 September 2014, with the Intermediate and Power Car arriving the following day. The complete 458 successfully ran under its own power on 11 October 2014, and one week later on 18 October 2014, made a surprise appearance at the Irish Traction Group's Diesel Gala—the first time the unit had carried passengers since withdrawal by NIR in 2012.\n\nThe DCDR stated that it planned to convert 458 into a standby buffet train.\n\nFile:Downpatrick 5.jpg File:458 At Downpatrick.JPG\n\n\nGallery\n\nFile:A diesel train approaching - geograph.org.uk - 350751.jpg File:Arrival at Larne Town station - geograph.org.uk - 2678520.jpg File:Whitehead station (3) - geograph.org.uk - 1044019.jpg File:Gt Victoria Street station, Belfast (4) - geograph.org.uk - 1177927.jpg File:Dhu Varren station (3) - geograph.org.uk - 785598.jpg File:Whitehead station at twilight (2) - geograph.org.uk - 1037043.jpg\n\n[1] Irish Railway Record Society - Northern Ireland Railways\n\n[2] Translink - New Central Corridor\n\n[3] Northern Ireland Railways Strategic Review - Final Report\n\n[4] Rail Vehicles for Disposal - Translink\n",

    "passage": "Q: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL WITH _USAGI YOJIMBO_, ANYWAY? - _@cwidtz_\n\nA: If you're not already familiar with _Usagi Yojimbo_, I can see why it might be a hard sell. On paper, it just sounds weird. I mean, it's a long-running samurai story where all the characters are cute furry animals, and that's just the start of things. It's exhaustively researched and set in feudal Japan, frequently using actual historical events as the centerpieces of its stories, but also ghosts and magic are completely real, it's cartoonish and frequently very funny with great buddy comedy bits and a ton of slapstick humor, but it's also very serious and violent, with the highest on-panel body count of any comic I read, and everyone who really loves it won't shut up about how great the word balloons are when people die. Even if you're willing to believe that it's very good, there's a lot there that sounds like it'd be hard to get into.\n\nBut since you asked, here's the big deal with _Usagi Yojimbo_: Stan Sakai's been doing this comic for over thirty years, and he hasn't done a bad issue yet.\n\nIn a weird way, I think that actually works against it, at least as far as getting the word out goes. The way people talk about comics --- and all media, really --- tends to be based around peaks and valleys. The stuff that gets press is either really bad or really good, and both of those are relative states, especially in comics where there are multiple teams working with the same character and setting. To go back to my favorite example, it's a whole lot easier to say that _this_ Batman story is better than _that_ Batman story and talk about which one works better, because there are always differences that make each one stand out. Even a long run by a single creative team tends to have its ups and downs.\n\nWith _Usagi_, there's a consistency that I don't think you'll find in anyone else's work, and that makes it hard to talk about. The first time you read an issue, the level of craftsmanship that's on display and how instantly engaging the characters are, and how accessible it is despite building on _decades_ of intricately plotted continuity is mind-blowing and it's all you want to talk about. Around that fourth issue, though, when it's still on that level, you've kind of run out of things to say. I used to joke that I could write one glowing, 10 out of 10, five-star review praising _Usagi_ and just copy and paste it every time a new issue came out. Saying that something hit a plateau has a negative connotation, but it's really the only way to describe it --- it's just that the plateau _Usagi_'s on is up above everyone else's peaks.\n\nI think that's why so many people always go to _Grasscutter_.\n\nWhenever anyone talks about the series, _Grasscutter_ is the one that gets brought up. It's _the_ Usagi story, the Eisner winner, the if-you-only-read-one comic that's always recommended as a starting point for new readers --- which is pretty weird when you consider that it's volume _twelve --_- and it's easy to see why.\n\nIt's everything that makes _Usagi Yojimbo_ great all happening at once: The perfect blend of history and mythology, the balance between action and comedy, political intrigue and the supernatural, and virtually every major character introduced in the series up to that point has a huge part to play. Plus, I'm not gonna lie, the way that it's structured is perfect for appealing to the pretentious side of the Comics Are Serious Literature crowd. I mean, this thing has _four prologues_, going into everything from the Shinto creation story to the establishment of the Shogunate in the 12th century, just to get things in place before the actual story begins. It's an epic in the purest sense of the word, spanning centuries of real history and building on ten years of Sakai's own world-building. And it's _great_.\n\nTo start with, we have our characters. In the lead, of course, is Miyamoto Usagi, the _ronin_ (masterless samurai) who became a wanderer after his lord died at the Battle of Adachigahara Plain. He's a character defined by honor and loyalty almost to a fault, and he's marked by kindness to others as much as his skill with a sword. Seriously, that ridiculously high body count I mentioned above? Most of it comes from the fact that Usagi can't walk from one village to another without being set upon by five or six bandits who are very, _very_ bad at picking their targets.\n\nJoining him are two frequent costars: Gen, a hard-drinking rhinocerous bounty hunter inspired by Toshiro Mifune's character from _Yojimbo_, and Tomoe, a friend and occasional love interest of Usagi based loosely on Tomoe Gozen, a real-life female samurai from the 12th century. She serves as the vassal for Lord Noriyuki, a young but wise panda who became lord of a province as a child when his father died. In addition to _them_, there's Sanshobo, a former samurai who became a priest, and Ikeda, a general and rival to Noriyuki's father who became a farmer after a failed coup and was presumed dead.\n\nAnd then there's Jei.\n\nJei, the Blade of the Gods, is without question one of the best villains in comics. He's essentially a slasher movie villain dropped into a samurai saga --- if you're being formal, you'd address him as _Jei-san_, a pun that took me actual years to get --- who wanders around killing everyone that he deems to be evil, tearing out their souls with his consecrated black blade. And, as you might have guessed, _everyone_ is evil, with the exception of Keiko, an innocent young girl who travels with him.\n\nThose are the major players, but the story also involves a clan of cat ninja, a deadly swordswoman named Inazuma, a conspiracy of eight lords who want to overthrow the shogun and reinstate the emperor, their leader Kotetsu, the witch that he hired to find the Grasscutter sword, her familiar, and a few other characters besides.\n\nIf that sounds like a lot, well, it's like I said: _Grasscutter_ is a story that ties together a decade's worth of characters and plots into a single story that revolves around one of the greatest treasures in Japanese history, full of unrelated threads that intersect, and massive battles for the fate of a country.\n\nAnd the battles _are_ massive --- one of Sakai's greatest tricks as a storyteller is how deceptive his style is, how it's so intricate but looks so simple and effortless as you're reading. The entire series is built around the visual gag of an anthropomorphic rabbit with his ears tied up to look like a samurai's topknot, and the book's full of little skulls that pop up whenever someone dies, so that even the most dead serious fight scenes have this whimsical, fantastic quality to them. You get used to how cartoonish it is, and then suddenly you're reading about a war between two full-on armies, full of historically accurate detail and dozens of characters fighting each other.\n\nThat _Grasscutter_ ties all of that stuff together at all is a pretty monumental achievement, and that it does it as perfectly as it does makes it a great comic, but what really sticks out about it is that it does it in a way that's welcoming and accessible for new readers.\n\nI've written before about creators who play the long game with how they build stories, laying groundwork and setting up long-term payoffs. It's something that a lot of my favorite runs have in common, like Simonson's _Thor_, Ostrander, Yale and McDonnell's _Suicide Squad_, Giffen, DeMatteis and Maguire's _Justice League_, even more recent stuff like Snyder and Capullo's _Batman_ or Waid and Samnee's _Daredevil_. They're arranged so intricately and build on each story, adding complexity and rewarding readers by laying out threads that tie up months or years down the line.\n\n_Grasscutter_ does that on a pretty massive scale, but the trick is that it does it so well that it seems simple and easy to get into even if this is the first time you've encountered these characters. Characters' traits come through so vividly, and everyone's role in the story is so well defined that it's engaging on every level. It fits together like clockwork.\n\nHere's the big trick, though: _Grasscutter_ is not unique. It might be a high point, sure, but it's not the only one, and it's not _that_ much higher than the rest of the run. The _entire series_ is that good.\n\nJust look at _Daisho_, the story that comes a year or two before _Grasscutter_. For my money, it's every bit as good, although it's certainly not as complex. It's actually a very simple premise, a story about the cruel leader of a gang of bandits who steals Usagi's swords and, and how Usagi goes about getting them back in a brutal and deadly display of skill. At its heart, it's a story about how important a samurai's weapons are to his honor, and it plays out almost exactly as you'd expect. It's something that almost feels standard-issue, a by-the-numbers revenge story where the irredeemably evil bandits get what's coming to them.\n\nA lot of _Usagi_ stories have that quality, especially the ones that come between longer arcs. So many of them are based on folktales or fables, short ghost stories or murder mysteries that our hero wanders into on his journey. Sakai has so much skill as a storyteller, though, that they never feel disposable, like he's padding things out until the next \"important\" story rolls around. The simplicity doesn't make them feel standard, it makes them feel accessible --- they're _always_ engaging, and they always feel like they're building on a foundation of solid character work and a setting that feels alive in a way few other comics ever manage.\n\nThere's an issue in _Seasons_, for instance --- the volume of shorter stories that comes directly before _Grasscutter_ --- built around Usagi meeting and dueling a samurai who has a grudge to settle against the man (or lion, in this case) who taught Usagi his unique sword style. In the span of a single issue, they go from allies to rivals, and at the end of it, he beats Usagi in a duel and tells him to pass the challenge onto his old master. Again, it's a standard-issue samurai premise; there's nothing more basic and mandatory than the challenge-to-the-master-of-a-fighting-style plot, right? But not only is it done with an incredibly engaging amount of skill, it's something that hangs in the background of the story for years, through _Grasscutter_, until it finally comes back forty issues later in _Duel at Kitanoji_.\n\nIt's a perfect illustration of the balance that Sakai strikes in this comic between accessibility and long-term planning. It's entirely possible to read _Duel at Kitanoji_, or _Grasscutter_, or _Daisho_, or any of the issues in _Seasons,_ without starting at the beginning and working your way straight through them --- the only one that really requires prior knowledge is _Grasscutter II_, and that one warns you what's up right in the title.\n\nSakai even has a habit of explaining in footnotes that _ronin_ means \"masterless samurai\" in almost every story, and in addition to being one of the book's most likable quirks, it's also a pretty strong indication of how he expects readers to be able to jump in at any time.\n\nBut then, why would you? There's no bad story to skip, no tedious setup to get through when you can jump right to the good stuff. It's _all_ the good stuff, and the only real reason not to just start at the beginning and work your way through it has nothing to do with the comic itself. Instead, it's just a function of the publication history --- the first 8 volumes are published by Fantagraphics and the rest are from Dark Horse, which means that it's rarely all in print at the same time. Still, it's entirely possible to just start at vol. 9, _Daisho,_ and keep going from there.\n\nI don't think I'm exaggerating at all when I say that Stan Sakai is arguably the greatest living comic book creator in the world, and _Usagi Yojimbo_ is a thirty-year masterpiece that has a consistency and craftsmanship that other comics only touch when they're at their peak. It's so good in every way that the people who love it rarely even bother to explain why anymore --- if we're not talking about it _all the time_, it's only because its greatness has been such a permanent part of comics that we're taking it as a given.\n\nAnd really, that's a pretty big deal.\n\n_Ask Chris art by Erica Henderson. _If you’ve got a question you’d like to see Chris tackle in a future column, just send it to @theisb on Twitter with the hashtag #AskChris.__\n",

    "passage": "Dead Man's Rule\n\n**Okay, so I wrote this for a story competition run by my school's annual publication, and while I don't sit down and write stories much this is my favourite that I've written.**\n\nThe body in the trunk should be alright, because it’s minus twenty-five. It’s morbid, but you can always rely on a Canadian winter for these kinds of things. The client’s only an hour away. \n\nI get to thinking that this should probably be my last job. I’m tired of hiding and tired of working, maybe even tired of killing, and the gritty details that come with it. I’ve never had a ‘home’, nor an office. Where the hell do you put a bureau of contract killers? It’s time to move on.\nI can’t pretend it has nothing to do with Eve – but believe me, I’ve tried. She’s being trying to get hold of me for as long as she could talk, and I’ve ignored her until now. But now – she’s in Canada, I’m in Canada – hell, I like Canada. Even now, when it’s snowing so hard that the light freezes as it comes out of my headlights. It suits me. I’m beginning to feel uncomfortable having left her without a father all this time, so I guess the least I could do is help her out with some of the money I’ve made.\n\nI not thinking about that. There’s a diner ahead. I’ll stop and eat.\nI park in the bay by the door, where they’ve cleared the path. I take off my boots, and select a pair at random from the five I have in a bag in the back seat. It’s the little forensic details, like the soles of your sneakers, that kill you, but I like to keep the lab coat cops guessing. I’ve been in this job for thirty years, and I’ve sussed it down to three rules: plan ahead; no collateral damage; keep it clean. That means one dead guy, one bullet, zero witnesses, and a thousand alibis. Anyone in this business will tell you the same. I’ve heard a few mentions of a fourth rule – the ‘Dead Man’s Rule’ - but it’s a myth. There’s nothing confusing about contract killing – it’s the most meticulous, clear headed, straight forward job in the world. It’s like being an accountant; pushing bullets instead of pushing pennies.\n\nI carry on driving. My Range Rover slices through the blizzard like hollow points through a brain. I hit a bump, and I hear a clanging coming from the trunk. It’s probably nothing, but I’ll check it out anyway. I open the trunk, and am suddenly reminded of why I want to retire. My tire iron got itself stuck inside Darth Vader’s helmet. These jobs are the worst.\nI was given an address, but how was I supposed to know that the job was at a goddamn Star Wars convention. I didn’t have a costume, which meant that, in a reversal of roles, I stood out like a sore thumb in a room full of Jedi’s and Stormtroopers. I had enough information to distinguish my target from the rest of the Dark Lords, and followed him until I could get a moment alone. It was impossible: there were people everywhere. I finally got him alone when he went to the restroom. I locked the door of the men’s room when everyone else was gone except him: I had him alone.\n\nMy vantage point wasn’t exactly a sniper’s nest, but perched on the john in the neighbouring cubicle, I could shoot the Dark Lord as he was having a leak. It’s not the noblest way to die, but I don’t deal in honourable deaths. As I pulled the trigger, he looked up, and the bullet hit him in the neck. He grasped at his throat, in some vain attempt to dislodge it from his windpipe. The blood painted the wall of the cubicle. It didn’t splatter, it was a crimson fountain. I was mesmerised by it: for the first time in thirty years, I hadn’t got a clean shot. I eradicated those thoughts by leaving my second shot in the right place this time. He slumped over, unravelled the toilet paper on his way down with an outstretched hand which he had pointed at me. His bloody hand left a print on the paper, a graffitied insignia of a dying man. I tore it off and flushed it. The fire exit in the toilet led to the secluded bay I parked my Rover in, so no one saw me dump the body in the trunk. Keep it clean.\nBy the time I was alone on the highway, the two bullets had been removed with a pair of tweezers and thrown down a drain in Toronto, my gun was buried in Lake Superior, and Darth Vader had been disrobed and his bloody clothes were now ashes on the highway. I kept the helmet next to him in the trunk, and set off on the twenty hour journey to Winnipeg. I don’t deal in contaminated corpses. I deal in 9mm holes and untraceable kills. That’s how I get by on three rules.\nThe road unwinds in front of me, and Winnipeg glows around the bend. Somewhere among those bare, snowy trees and tower blocks is Eve, and she’s been waiting for me for thirty years. I’ve already planned my route. I’ll meet my client in Tuxedo, we’ll conclude our business, and I’ll turn left from his home so I can carry straight on to Woodhaven. That’s where she told me she’s been living for the past five years. One left turn.\n\nThe client’s home looks expensive. Tuxedo is fittingly the ‘black tie’ district of Winnipeg, where all the suits live. It’s where Eve tells me she’s going to live once she makes enough money. I could help her here. I’ve got enough cash. I can settle down with her in Tuxedo, learn all about what I’ve missed over thirty years.\n\nI don’t know what the guy wants with the nerd, and I don’t care. His Rolex glistens in my headlights, and he gives me a signal to back into his garage. I do, but only so the trunk goes under. I’m not trapping myself in a client’s house. I step out, and embrace the cold again. We crowd round the trunk like children crowd round a fire. When I open it, his look is not one that says ‘ten thousand dollars’. It says something which my ears block out, but that my eyes read for me. It can’t be. I’ve never broken a rule. The wrong body. The wrong goddamn Darth Vader.\nHis eyes look to me for an explanation, while his hand looks to his jacket for a gun. My brain can’t get one to him in time, and his fingers react with a flash of gunpowder. My jaw is the victim.\n\nI punch the gun from his hand, and scrape it from the ground. It has my splattered blood on it. Now it has his blood on it too. He falls to the ground with a clack as his watch cracks against the concrete. I hit him where he road map. I hit him where he meant to hit me. Blood carries the broken glass with it along the edges of the tiles in a sanguine road map. I hit him where he meant to hit me.\n\nThere is a scream from behind, one that slices through me. The Client’s wife stares straight through me at her dead husband. I raise my gun, but don’t have the energy to fire. The girl runs off, and cries for help. One left turn, and it’ll all be over.\n\nI think about my options. I can’t carry on working, because I have no energy, no passion for the job anymore. I can’t settle down because I’m a wanted man, that woman saw me.\n\nI think about Eve. How can I go to her and say I haven’t been her father for thirty years because I’ve been killing people. I can’t give my blood stained earnings and tell her to buy a house. I pray to God she’ll forgive me, but I don’t have a God to pray to. I don’t know what the right thing to do is, because my moral compass is broke. Just one left turn.\n\nI realise the flaw with my rules. There is a fourth rule. There is a Dead Man’s Rule. It’s not a rule that can be broken, it’s a law of physics, an unbreakable rule: in this job, no matter how many rules you have, and no matter how long you last, you’re going to end up dead. If not dead in the most literal sense, then dead inside. That’s when you learn the Dead Man’s Rule. I’m stuck in a loop, dead on the inside. I’ve nowhere to go, and if I were to die now, it wouldn’t make any difference to how I live my life. I’ve reached my expiry date.\n\nThe car starts up first time.\n\nI turn right.\n\n",

    "passage": "  \"In 1999 a woman in the UK, Sally Clark, was convicted of murdering her two children. They had both seemingly died from SIDS (more commonly known as cot death), an unexpected but natural cause of death.\n\n  One of the main pieces of evidence against her was the testimony of a Professor and expert on child-abuse. He used the probability of one child (in a family with no known factors that might increase the chance of SIDS) dying of SIDS (1 in 8543). He then squared this fraction to get the probability of BOTH children dying from SIDS being about 1 in 73 million.\n\n  The jury saw this number as the probability of an innocent explanation and, since it was so low, found her guilty of the murders. Unfortunately the professor who testified was not an expert on probability and miscalculated. The jury also did not understand the meaning of the statistic being calculated and drew the wrong conclusions from it.\n\n  In this series of lessons we will look at why this probability of 1 in 73 million is both wrong and irrelevant to the case. We will also look at how probability could have been properly used in this case.\"\n\nThis is the introduction to a series of lessons on probability.This case will frame the students' work on probability throughout the unit and not one student will ask \"when am I ever going to use this?\"\n\nThere are many options on how open or closed a project this is. Because I was short on time (being interviewed) I first asked them if they could spot any problems in the probability (useful for showing progression) before working in quite a closed manner, as a class, through section 1**.\n\n\nSection 1 - Improbable events never happen\n\nIntroduce expected frequency of events. After students understand the general concept and are able to calculate the expected frequency of different events. Get them to work on the questions below:\n\n  The probability that both babies in a family of two will die of cot-death is 1/73'000'000.\n  There are about 340 million families with two children in the world.\n  1) How many families would you expect both babies to die of cot-death?\n\n  The probability of winning the lottery is 1/14'000'000.\n  About 7.5 million people play the lottery each week\n  2) How many winners would you expect to get:\n  i) Each week\n  ii) Each month\n  iii) Each year\n  iv) In 10 years\n\n  The probability of being born with 11 fingers or toes is 1/500.\n  3) What other information do you need to estimate the number of people in Bristol who were born with 11 fingers or toes?\n\n  4) Look at your answer to question 1. How is it related to the court case mentioned earlier? Does the answer to question 3 help you decide whether the woman was innocent or guilty?\n\n  5) Since the probability that both babies in a family of two will die naturally is 1/73'000'000, does that mean that the probability that both were murdered is 72'999'999/73'000'000? Explain why/why not?\n\nI then got students to discuss question 4 in pairs before sharing with the group.\nConcepts to get across:\n\n-   Probability is an estimate of frequency and whether something will happen or not depends a lot on the number of trials.\n-   Probability can not say for certain whether she is guilty or not as unlikely events do happen (though we can't be sure that's what happened here).\n-   The 73 million outcomes will include mostly families where neither child has died or a single child has died.\n\nYou could also go in to relative frequency here. This may help students understand where the 1 in 8543 statistic might have come from.\n\n\nSection 2 - Dependent and Independent Events\n\nHere you need to go in depth about the difference between dependent and independent events. Pupils need to be able to distinguish between the two, have some understanding about how the outcome of one event can change the probability of other events (e.g. if it rains today I am less likely to hang my washing out) and how to draw a probability tree from conditional probability problems.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the case? Well, the probability of 1 in 8543 can only be squared if the death of the two children are independent events (otherwise the probability of the second death would be a different fraction). The causes of SIDS is not entirely known, but it is highly plausible that there could be genetic or environmental factors that would be common to the two children. This would mean that if there were a SIDS death in a family, then further SIDS deaths would be more likely than otherwise.\n\nStudents can work on these questions to see this in action*:\n\n  1a. The probability that a family's first baby will die of cot-death is 1/8543.\n  If the first baby dies of cot-death, the probability that the second will also die of cot-death is 1/442.\n  If the first baby DOES NOT die of cot-death, the probability that the second will die of cot-death is 1/11002.\n  Draw a probability tree to show this information.\n\n  b. What is the probability that:\n   i. Neither child dies of cot-death?\n   ii. One of the children die of cot-death?\n   iii. Both children die of cot-death?\n\n  c. Using the number of families in the world with two children from the previous lesson (340 million), calculate how many families would you expect both babies to die of cot-death?\n\n  d. Why might the probability that the second child will die of cot-death be affected by whether the first child has also died of cot-death?\n\n\nSection 3 - Further Conditional Probability\n\nNow we get in to Bayes' theorem and the real reason why the 1 in 37 million statistic is simply irrelevant to the case:\n\n[]\n\nAs seen in question 5 from section one, the probability of 1 in 73'000'000, even if it were correct, is not the probability of innocence. It would instead be the probability that if you picked any random family of two children, both children would have died AND the cause of death was cot-death. This is not appropriate to use in this case because we already know that both children died.\n\nAgain, pupils could first work on standard conditional probability questions until they are comfortable with the function and usage of the above formula. Then pupils are going to calculate the probability that both children have died of cot-death GIVEN that both children have died. They can also compare this to the probability that both children were murdered GIVEN that both children have died:\n\n  The probability that both children in a family of two will be murdered is 1 in 10 million.\n  1. What is the probability that both children will die of cot-death OR murder (use the probability calculated in the previous session).\n\n  2. What is the probability that both children have died of cot-death given that both children have died of EITHER cot-death OR murder?\n\n  2. What is the probability that both children have been murdered given that both children have died of EITHER cot-death OR murder?\n\n  3. How do these two probabilities compare?\n\n  4. How does this change your view of the case?\n\n  5. Does this help you decide whether the woman was innocent or guilty? How?\n\n\nWrapping it up\n\nA great way to recap all of this would be to get the students to prepare a letter to send to the judge of the case explaining the ways in which probability has been misused in this case and in what ways the calculations could be improved upon.\nWhat is particularly great about this is that when they are done you can compare their letters to the letter written by the The Royal Statistical Society voicing their concerns (here) or the more specific letter written by Professor A.P. Dawid (of the R.S.S.) for her (successful) appeal (here)\n\n\nComments and Thoughts\n\n*Although many of the figures used above are directly from the court case, and some are estimates based on other data I was able to find online, some of the data is currently unavailable and therefore is made up and should be used purely for illustration purposes.\n\n**How I would prefer to run it:\n\n-   Start each class recapping previous work and ideas on the case\n-   Introduce the topic of the lesson and work on standard questions of that topic\n-   Ask students: \"how this topic might be related to the case? What data would we need to apply today's skills to this case?\"\n-   Give them the data they ask for and let them do the calculations.\n-   Ask students: \"How does this new information change your view of the case? Does this help you decide whether the woman is innocent or guilty? Why?\"\n\nThere are many other problems with the probability used in the case including (but definitely not limited to):\n\n-   Some environmental factors were included in the calculation, which make the probability of cot-death less likely, but many other factors in this individual case (which could increase the risk of cot-death) were not included.\n-   Cot-death is not the only alternative cause of death to the theorised double-murder, but the probability of these other causes of death were not included.\n-   The study where the 1 in 8543 figure came from was not intended for use in a criminal trial and instead is looking at possible causes of cot-death. It does not, therefore, directly apply to this case.\n\nI thought for some time about the ethics of using a real, living person's tragedy as the basis for a Maths lesson. However, since this particular miscarriage of justice is due solely to the misunderstanding of basic probability by many of the involved parties, its use to encourage a better understanding of this topic seems appropriate. I wouldn't want to involve this in a quick and easy pseudo-context question. Instead it should be handled with the importance and gravitas it deserves.\n\nHere are some other links about this case:\n\n-   Wikipedia\n-   UnderstandingUncertainty.org\n-   Berkeley University - This one is my favourite. Though it is more complex than some of the others, it has a lot more information about the lack of data in some areas and the assumptions that need to be made in order to make the calculations work. Interestingly, this paper argues that the probability of double-murder is much higher (over 99%) than stated in any of the letters endorsed by the R.S.S. (the point still stands, however, that statistics, if used in court at all, should be verified and reviewed by professionals).\n-   Bad Science\n\n",

    "passage": "Eddie Panlilio\n\nEDDIE “AMONG ED” TONGOL PANLILIO (born December 6, 1953) is a Kapampangan Filipino Roman Catholic priest and Governor of Pampanga. He was suspended from his priestly duties upon announcing his intention to run as governor. He was elected governor in May 2007 in a three-way race against incumbent governor Mark Lapid and provincial board member Lilia Pineda. In February 2010, following a recount of votes due to an election protest, the Comelec ruled that Lilia Pineda had won the 2007 election over Panlilio.[1]\n\nPanlilio was named “Filipino of the Year” for 2007 by the Philippine Daily Inquirer.[2]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n[Minalin, Pampanga (Poblacion) ancestral house and lot (where Eddie Panlilio was born)] Eddie Panlilio was born in Minalin, Pampanga on December 6, 1953. He is the sixth of seven children of Gervacio Cunanan Panlilio and Catalina Tongol. He is afflicted with vitiligo, a rare skin disease.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school at the Minalin Central Elementary School, Panlilio enrolled the Don Bosco Academy, Pampanga his sophomore year after spending a year at the Don Honorio Ventura College of Arts and Trades (DHVCAT). Panlilio was in and out of several seminaries as he went through a long discernment process, and after finishing his theology at the St. Augustine Major Seminary was ordained priest on December 13, 1981.\n\n\nPriesthood\n\n[Eddie T. Panlilio and 15 other priests from Minalin, Pampanga (Santa Monica Parish Church museum)] For fifteen years, Panlilio was the director of the Social Action Center of Pampanga (SACOP), which worked with communities displaced by lahar following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. He established the micro-lending program Talete Panyulung ning Kapampangan Inc. (TPKI), based on the Grameen Bank-approach. Now on its 20th year, TPKI released P2 billion in loans to small entrepreneurs in Central Luzon.[3]\n\nPanlilio was suspended from the priesthood by his superior, San Fernando archbishop Paciano Aniceto, for running for governor of Pampanga in 2007.[4] This means that he is forbidden by the Catholic Church to act like a priest or perform any of the sacraments reserved to priests. The Code of Canon Law, specifically Canon 285.3, forbids priests from occupying political posts.[5][6] Bishop Leonardo Medroso, chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines Episcopal Commission on Canon Law cited a conflict between a role in politics and in the church.\n\n\nPolitical career\n\nPanlilio ran for the position of governor of Pampanga province in the 2007 Philippine general election. Panlilio defended his controversial decision to enter politics as a logical continuation of his ministry for the poor, whom he sees as having been exploited and neglected for too long by successive administrations of corrupt and uncaring politicians.[7]\n\nWithout any political party, he won over his two competitors, provincial board member Lilia Pineda and re-electionist governor Mark Lapid (both allies of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo). He defeated Pineda by a slim margin of 1,147 votes out of over 600,000 votes cast.[8]\n\nGovernor of Pampanga\n\nPanlilio was inaugurated as the 26th governor of the province of Pampanga on June 30, 2007. Supreme Court Associate Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago administered the oath of office. During the inauguration, the new governor vowed to stop corruption and to make the province an example of a “new dawn in Philippine politics”.[9] [10] On July 4, 2007 Among Ed began serving his term amid the province's hope to erase its reputation of being the country's Vatican of “jueteng” or illegal gambling. Pampanga has had a long history of patronage politics and corruption.[11]\n\nOne of Panlilio's achievements in office was to increase the province's revenue from quarry taxes. It is suspected that under previous governors, notably Mark Lapid and Lito Lapid, the large quarry industry was riddled with corruption and graft.[12][13] The increased tax base has led to fighting among mayors over the new revenue.[14]\n\nOn August 27, 2007, Panlilio campaigned to bring his government closer to the Kapangpangans by leading the caravan “_Pamisaupan_ (_Helping One Another_)” in Pampanga. Panlilio and his team delivered bags of cement, toilet bowls, boxes of floor tiles and cans of paint to San Luis Hospital which had only 2 doctors, 8 nurses and 10 midwives to serve 140,000 residents of San Luis, Pampanga, San Simon, Pampanga and Candaba, Pampanga. Panlilio further vowed to improve the facilities and conditions in the province's 9 district hospitals including the Diosdado Macapagal Provincial Hospital from funds (P143-million development fund) and private groups' contributions. Panlilio stated, _What we are doing is bringing the provincial government's services to the people to make health, education and livelihood assistance accessible to them_. The capitol's P37-million special education fund (SEF) would be utilized for the SEFs of towns.[15]\n\nPanlilio, launched the White Ribbon campaign on October 1, 2007 to engage the people of Pampanga to get involved in the crusade for good governance and good citizenship. Some 70 people gathered and white ribbons marked with words “_Good Governance_” and handbills with messages were distributed. Panlilio stated: “_I believe that the spirit of the white ribbon is still very much alive. This campaign is really a call and for a response to people to be involved in good governance and good citizenship_.” [16] [Minalin, Pampanga “Museo Ampon Simpanan Kabiasnan Ning Minalin” (Museum and Library of Minalin Among Ed Corner - books donated by Panlilio after his 2010 election defeat)]\n\nOn October 13, 2007, Panlilio admitted that a palace staff personally gave him a brown paper gift bag with 500,000 Philippine pesos (P1,000 bills in 5 bundles, P100,000 each). Panlilio confessed that money changed hands after the meeting “because as a priest and a public officer, I should not lie. I believe that since the money came from Malacanang, I also believe it is public money. So I should be accountable for it and transparent about it.” Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo called the meeting with 200 officers of the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines (Ulap), an organization of governors, mayors and other local officials. It was held after Mrs. Arroyo met 190 congressmen, where envelopes of P200,000 and P500,000 were distributed. Cebu Rep. Antonio Cuenco confirmed he was given P200,000 as “_Christmas gift_.”[17]\n\nPanlilio on June 23, 2008 filed a 6-page complaint-affidavit for plunder against Lubao businessman Rodolfo “Bong\" Pineda before the Ombudsman in Quezon City. He accused Pineda of conspiracy with Joseph Estrada, based on the verdict rendered by the Sandiganbayan.[18]\n\nPampanga Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, on July 10 led the 69 bishops-signatories (of 80 bishops who attended the July plenary assembly of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines), to petition the Ombudsman, to “really attend to the merits” of the plunder case. Bishop Broderick Pabillo, director of the CBCP National Secretariat for Social Action, on the request of the Pampanga Anti-Gambling Council (PAGC) appealed to the CBCP. The letter states: “In the whole trial of Estrada, the name of Bong Pineda was mentioned several times. But he was dropped along the way. He has been free and no case was filed against him.”[19]\n\nPanlilio on June 26, 2008, in his 20-page counter-affidavit filed with the Office of the Ombudsman, moved for the dismissal of the April, 2008 (Vice Governor Joseller Guiao / provincial board / Panlilio supporter Lolita Hizon) corruption (R.A. 3019) suit against him failure to implement the September, 2007 Ordinance 176. DOJ Justice Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez did not act on Panlilio's November, 2007 petition to nullify the ordinance, for it was “not a tax ordinance,” further ruling that the P 300 was a “regulatory fee.” Panlilio's however, who obtained a temporary restraining order from the Pampanga RTC (challenging Gonzalez's ruling), also asked for the suspension of the Ombudsmand perjury case, on the ground of “prejudicial question” raised by the Pampanga civil action.[20]\n\nIn Diliman, Quezon City, Candaba Mayor Jerry Pelayo, in tears, joined by 18 Pampanga mayors (except San Fernando and Angeles mayors) waged war against Panlilio by means of prayer. The members of the Pampanga Mayors League (PML) on June 26, 2008, attacked Eddie Panlilio due to his “autocratic style of governance” and alleged poor performance in office. The PML released the statement: “Panlilio is a type of leader who loves to project himself in media as good and working governor when in fact he has not accomplished anything significant for the welfare of the Kapampangan and for the development of the province for almost a year in office except the increase in quarry collection.” [21] [22]\n\nLawyer Elly Velez Lao Pamatong filed a perjury criminal case with the COMELEC Legal Department on June 24, 2008, against Eddie Panlilio for under-declaration of expenditures and contribution receipts: “Contrary to law, Fr. Eddie T. Panlilio, knowingly and maliciously concealed P6,011,329.51 in political contribution and what he declared was only P4,761,699.90.”[23]\n\nThough all of these accusations were not proven enough.\n\nRecount petition and dismissal\n\nOn August 21, 2008, a non-profit organization Kapanalig at Kambilan Ning Memalen Pampanga Inc. (Kambilan), led by its president Rosve Henson, a former election campaigner of losing gubernatorial candidate Lilia Pineda, launched a recall campaign against Panlilio, on the ground of loss of confidence in the governor’s leadership. In the case of Pampanga, the required petitioners must be at least 98,703 which represent 10% of the total number of registered voters in Pampanga as of 20 April 2007, the 2007 Philippine general election. This is based on the records of Commission on Elections, as required by Section 74, RA 7160, and COMELEC Resolution 7505, in relation to ARTICLE X, Sec. 3 and Section 74 of R.A. 7160, LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE 1, as amended by Section 1, RA 9244.2 Panlilio is the first Pampanga governor which was subject of the recall campaign.[24][25]\n\nOn October 15, 2008, a formal recall petition against Panlilio for loss of confidence was filed with the Commission on Elections. 15,000 “Kambilan” petitioners delivered 168 boxes containing the 224,875 voters' signatures from 20 Pampanga towns and San Fernando City.[26] In a 32-page petition, Panlilio moved to dismiss the recall petition.[27][28]\n\nIn February 2010, COMELEC announced that they had conducted a recount following an election protest.[29] The Comelec ruled that Lilia Pineda had won in fact won election three years earlier and Pineda replace Panlilio as governor.[30] After that, they ordered him to step down from this position, but he only stepped down after he lost to Pineda in the 2010 elections. He was succeeded by Lilia Pineda on June 30, 2010.\n\n\nPost-governorship\n\nPanlilio ran once again as governor in the 2013 elections, but he lost once again to incumbent governor Lilia Pineda.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] Gawad Kalinga takes Panlilio as partner in lifting poor\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] Inquirer.net, Board votes in favor of mayors vs Panlilio\n\n[15] Inquirer.net, Panlilio brings government closer to people\n\n[16] [http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2007/10/02/san.fernando.capitol.launches.white.ribbon.campaign.(11.10.a.m.).html SunStar, San Fernando: Capitol launches White Ribbon campaign (11:10 a.m.)]\n\n[17] Inquirer.net, Saying he can't lie, Fr.

He was promoted to the former's main squad in 2007, but was demoted to fourth-choice after Rafael Santos' promotion. Weverton was subsequently loaned to Remo, Oeste[1] and América (RN).[2] With the latter he appeared regularly in Série B, sharing minutes with the veteran Rodolpho.\n\nWeverton was released by _Timão_ in January 2010 and shortly after moved to Botafogo (SP). After impressing with the side, he signed for Portuguesa on 12 May.[3] Weverton was an undisputed starter at _Lusa_, appearing in all league matches in 2011, as his side were crowned champions.\n\nIn May 2012 he joined Atlético Paranaense, after his previous contract expired.[4] On 15 October 2014, after being named captain for the campaign, Wéverton renewed his contract until 2017.[5]\n\nIn December 2017, Weverton joined Palmeiras on a five-year deal.[6]\n\n\nInternational career\n\nOn 31 July 2016, he was called by the Brazilian Olympic team for the 2016 Summer Olympics by manager Rogério Micale to replace Fernando Prass who left the team due to injury.[7] In the gold medal match, Weverton made a key save against Germany's Nils Petersen on the fifth penalty shot, which helped Brazil win their first Olympic football gold.[8]\n\nAfter winning gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Weverton was called up by coach Tite to qualification matches against Ecuador and Colombia.[9]\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\n  Club                  Season    League    Cup    Continental   State League   Total\n  --------------------- --------- --------- ------ ------------- -------------- ------- ------ ------- ------ ------- ---- ---\n  Division              Apps      Goals     Apps   Goals         Apps           Goals\n  América-RN            2009      Série B   16     0             0              0\n  Total                 16        0         0      0             0              0\n  Portuguesa            2010      Série B   29     0             —              —\n  2011                  38        0         —      —             19             0\n  2012                  Série A   1         0      4             0              —\n  Total                 68        0         4      0             0              0\n  Atlético Paranaense   2012      Série B   33     0             0              0\n  2013                  Série A   38        0      13            0              —\n  2014                  35        0         2      0             8              0\n  2015                  36        0         4      0             6              0\n  2016                  30        0         8      0             —              20\n  2017                  34        0         4      0             12             0\n  Total                 206       0         31     0             26             0\n  Palmeiras             2018      Série A   23     0             4              0\n  2019                  28        0         3      0             10             0\n  Total                 51        0         7      0             16             0\n  Career total          319       0         38     0             36             0\n\nInternational\n\n[10]\n\n  National team   Year   Apps   Goals\n  --------------- ------ ------ -------\n  Brazil          2017   2      0\n  2020            2      0\n  Total           4      0\n\n  : Appearances and goals by national team and year\n\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nPortuguesa\n\n-   Campeonato Brasileiro Série B: 2011\n\nAtlético Paranaense\n\n-   Campeonato Paranaense: 2016\n\nPalmeiras\n\n-   Campeonato Brasileiro Série A: 2018\n\nInternational\n\nBrazil\n\n-   Olympic Gold Medal: 2016\n\n[1] Corinthians promove goleiro da base para emprestar Weverton (Corinthians promotes goalkeeper from the youth setup to loan Weverton); UOL Esporte, 27 December 2012\n\n[2] \n\n[3] Portuguesa tira o goleiro Weverton do Botafogo (Portuguesa takes off Weverton from Botafogo); Estadão, 12 May 2010\n\n[4] Goleiro Weverton, ex-Lusa, é apresentado no Atlético-PR (Goalkeeper Weverton, former _Lusa_ player, is presented at Atlético-PR); Diário Lance!, 30 May 2012\n\n[5] Líder no atual elenco atleticano, Weverton renova até 2017 (Leader in the current _atleticano_ roster, Weverton renews until 2017); Redação Em Campo, 15 October 2014\n\n[6] Palmeiras anuncia a contratação do goleiro Weverton, ex-Atlético-PR (Palmeiras announces the signing of goalkeeper Weverton, former Atlético-PR side); Globoesporte.com, 15 December 2017\n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] Tite convoca seleção pela 1ª vez com 7 campeões olímpicos e 3 novidades\n\n[10] \n",

    "passage": "[RO] Madeline Chapter 1 (tell me what you think of the story so far)\n\nChapter 1\n\"UP NEXT ON THE POLE VAULT, LITTLE ROCK HIGH'S OWN DEFENDING CHAMPION, MADI ENGLEHEARDT.\" A well figured girl walked up to the ready line, her silky black hair falling down behind her softly carved face as she stood up. This girl, Madeline Engleheardt, was getting ready to defend her record. She was the lead on her high school's gymnastic's team and the pole vault was her best feat on record. As she walked up to the line, the gymnasium practically erupted with cheers. Most everyone in attendance that night went to Little Rock, so inevitably they were cheering for Madeline. The rest of the crowd, didn't care, or were so drowned out by the Little Rock cheerers that you wouldn't know they were there.\n\n\n\n  One of the loudest cheers was coming from Chad Robertson, Madeline's boyfriend of 3 years, and the resident stud man slash linebacker. Chad stood over most people at 6 foot 6 inches. His muscle build and attitude being very intimidating to someone who first met him. This was a far cry from Madeline's persona. She was an innocent girl, but as radiant as the sun, making friends with almost anyone she came in contact with. Most people were surprised when the two started dating, because of how different they were. Madeline wouldn't admit this, but her original intent was to change Chad into a nicer guy. Eventually she gave up on this intent, but he had grown on her by that point and she couldn't leave him. The person who was most surprised by these two, was Madeline's long time friend, Nate Gardner. Nate and her had been friends since the end of Elementary School. So long ago, that the two still had both their parents at the time.\n\n\n\n  Nate was more of a behind the scenes kind of guy. He stood at 5 foot 10 inches and was slender, but had no muscle build on him. He had black wavy hair that was swooped to the side, and black hipster glasses that pulled his  outfit's together. He was hard to get to know, not because he was a difficult person to deal with, but because of his shyness, and lack of conversational skills. However, once you got to know him, he was a good friend. He would defend you in any way he knew how, and would stay by you. He was in a major dilemma, he had been for quite some time. If he was to be honest with himself, he wouldn't have even known why he was at this event. He wanted to support his friend, but that was the problem. He also wanted to be more than friends. He had a crush on Madeline as long as he could remember being able to have these feelings. He was a hopeless romantic, looking for a girl who would appreciate the things he would do for her, and who would return the favor. He had regular dreams of marrying Madeline, and having kids with her, growing old with her, and making her the happiest girl in the world. That's what made him downright angry about Madeline being with Chad. In his words, \"that douchebag doesn't know the first thing about class, or treating a girl right\". Of course, he wouldn't have said that in public, he wouldn't risk getting his ass kicked. Nevertheless, those were the feelings constantly floating in his head.\n\n\n\n  Nate sat there on the bleachers watching his one true love getting ready to do what she did best, and he felt happy for her, although this feeling was quickly taken away, as Chad sat down next to him. \"Shit, this is awesome isn't it bro? My babe about to accomplish another great record.\" Nothing irked Nate more than Chad calling Madeline his \"babe\". Nate responded with, \"yeah man it's awesome\". Although before he could finish his sentence, Chad was gone. It was about this time that Madeline stepped up to the starting line, and with the sound of a buzzer, she began her run. She ran majestically, like the well fit evolved creature she was. Picking up speed she went to push her pole into the ground to create the lift needed for the jump. However, this time was different then all the other times. This time, was a purely accidental situation. Her hands were dripping with sweat, nervous sweat to be exact. Even though she was defending a record already set, it was still a nerve racking task for her. As she planted the pole into the ground, the energy lifted her forward and into the air. However, before she could follow through with the rest of the move, her hands slipped and she was thrown on a sideways tilt. Her life practically flashed before her eyes as she now tumbled in flight. Even though it was a split second between her slip, and contacting the ground, it felt like an eternity.\n\n\n\n  She hit the ground on her ankles with a cracking sound that could be heard all the way from the front row. Screaming in pain as she laid there on the hard wood floor, many audience members, whether they were pro Little Rock or not, rushed over to help in any way possible. Some people were yelling for somebody to call an ambulance, other's were asking her too many questions about the condition of her leg. Sitting there, she kept thinking, don't they know I cant move my damn leg. It's broken she thought, I screwed this one up, good going Madi.\n\n\n\n  Nate tried to get close to her, but he was entrapped in a sea of people. He finally pushed through, and went to talk to her. However, before he could get to her, Chad tapped him on the shoulder and said, \"I got this from here bruh\". He went over to comfort his girlfriend, and Nate stood there steaming red with anger. This was the first time he actually felt like lashing out against Chad, his better judgement kept him from it though. He watched as Madi's mother and Chad followed the Paramedics out of the Gymnasium with Madi on a stretcher, still whimpering from the excruciating pain. At that moment, an announcement came over the speaker, \"Ladies and Gentleman, due to the uh circumstances that just arose, tonight's event will be postponed to a later date. This date will be sent out in an email as soon as possible. Thank you for attending tonight, and we hope to see you again at the next event\". The announcement was a strange one. Although, the whole evening had turned into a strange one. The Principal didn't really know what else to say. His star gymnast had just cracked her ankles, and would probably be out for the rest of the season. Everyone was still in shock, and that was about all that could be said at that moment.\n\n\n\n  Nate laid in his bed that night, listening to his Green Day CD's and reflecting on that evening. One of the many things he had in common with Madeline was her taste of music. They were both into Green Day, Blink-182, Sum-41, and similar groups. But they both cared for the older stuff more than the newer stuff. Every time he heard any of those groups, he couldn't help but start thinking about her, and tonight was no exception. As he laid there, he thought about what his next course of action should be. He mulled over it and came to a decision. Supposing that Chad, being a creature of habit, wouldn't do much to care for his girlfriend while she was recovering. He knew that if he could wedge himself in between the two in this sensitive time, he'd possibly have a shot to explain his true feelings, and win her over. He could also use this as a way to test the waters. It wasn't a scenario he wanted to entertain, but he knew he had to. If she didn't think of him as more than a friend, then he could pull back and say he was only doing things for her as a good friend would, during a time like this. He would still be able to keep her as a friend. If it was one thing he couldn't stand the thought of, it was him accidentally fucking up their friendship and making things too awkward to work anymore.\n\n\n\n  He was a little troubled by his plan at first. It sounded manipulating, and as if he would be taking away Madeline's happiness. But as he thought about it more he decided it had to be done for two reasons. The first being that he knew Chad. He knew that Chad would do nothing but hurt her, and he couldn't stand the thought of that. The second is that he knew she was the one for him, and he couldn't stand the thought of never knowing if she had feelings for him, or worse, knowing she did, too late. As Dexter Holland sang the final words of \"The Kids Aren't Alright\", he made his final decision. He was declaring war on Chad, and nothing could change his mind.\n\n\n\n  The next morning seemed to come so fast, he was so tired the night before that as soon as he closed his eyes, he was asleep. He woke up at 7am, unusual for him on a Saturday morning, but he wasn't about to go back to sleep. He was far too excited to go see Madeline, but at the same time was having a bit of a problem. Deciding that he couldn't just walk in and see her, He figured he had to at least bring her flowers, or something. But what if she takes that as coming on too strong, he thought? After some mulling over the situation, he realized that the only flower shop in town didn't open until 12 on Saturday's. He wanted to see her before Chad got to her, so flower's weren't an option. He quickly took a shower, brushed his teeth, and picked out what he thought was his best outfit, and headed out the door.\n\n\n\n  Heading over to Madeline's house on this day was unlike something Nate had ever experienced. Little Rock was not a very big town, and the school football and gymnastics teams we're their claim to fame. After Madeline's accident, the town, or at least those who cared about such things, developed a somber attitude. Football was out of season at the time, and with gymnastics being the only other thing they had, it was looking pretty grim for the town in terms of local sports. There were other's on the gymnastics team, but Madeline held them all together, and without her, they wouldn't do nearly as well.\n\n\n\n  When he got to her house, someone was just leaving, it was her aunt who had brought over some meals for her and her mom. With her Mom working full time, Madeline was usually in charge of making dinner for the two, but with her inability to stand up, that wasn't an option. Her mom saw Nate and quickly greeted him and let him in. Her name was Victoria, and she was one of the brightest and most fun loving people anyone could ever meet. She stood short at a mere 5 foot, 1 inches, but being of Italian descent, size didn't take away from her authoritative image. She would give you the shirt off her back, but mess with her, or worse, her daughter, she would do you in, plain and simple. She was notorious in the town, and no one dared cross her, even the near 7 foot hustlers down at the bar had the utmost respect for her. She asked how he and his Dad were doing, to which he replied they were holding their own. After some small talk and catching up, she told him that Madi was in her room and had been hoping he would stop by.\n\n\n\n  Walking down the hallway he noticed all the pictures and awards hanging on the wall, documenting her life and beyond. He found one picture at the end of her Mom wearing what looked to be a hippy outfit and standing next to a bunch of people with bong's and pipe's. He knew her Mom was cool, but didn't realize she had a past like that. Smirking, he knocked on Madeline's door saying, \"Hey, Madeline it's Nate. Can I come in?\" She quickly responded, her voice giving Nate butterflies. As he opened the door, he immediately felt pity on her. Here was a talented gymnast and an all around go getter kind of person, and she was stranded in her bed, stuck with her CD's and whatever was on TV at the time. Although amongst these issues, Nate noticed she still had a smile on her face, as if to say, it's all going to be ok. That smile was very reassuring to him, even though he wasn't the one who was suffering.\n\n\n\n  \"Hey you, what's up?\" Madeline said with a smile. Nate replied that he had heard a soon to be olympic gymnast was in town and he wanted to possibly get her autograph before she left. Madi laughed in only a way Nate could make her, and she motioned for him to hug her. As the two locked together, Nate had trouble controlling his manhood. So much so that she felt it. \"Woah there buddy, a little excited to see me?\" Nate realized what had just happened and he was mortified, he thought that this was it, and he just really screwed up his chances big time. He stood there with an unknown expression locked on his face for a few seconds, until Madeline laughed and told him he was totally fine, and that, that kind of stuff happens to pretty girls all the time. Not sure what to say next, he nervously laughed and agreed, and she blushed, still smiling and looking at him. He attempted to quickly change subjects.\n\n\n\n  \"Did you hear Green Day's new album yet? American Idiot?\", Nate asked Madi. She said she hadn't heard it yet, but was trying to get her hands on it. She told him about her life long dream of meeting Billie Joe Armstrong, Nate asked her about the other two in the band. She replied, \"The bass player seems kind of hard to talk to, and the drummer is just weird\", they both laughed. About that time, Madi's Mom came in and said that she should get some rest, she had a big day with the doctor's tomorrow. As she left, Madeline signaled for Nate to come over. She gave him a really strong hug and said, \"Thanks for coming to see me, I'm really glad you did\". Nate took one look at her smile, and his heart melted to mush. He smiled and said, \"Any time\". With that, he left and didn't see her for the next few days.",

    "passage": "PROVIDENCE — Bananas, pineapples and pears — thousands of them — stream across the docks on their way to supermarkets throughout the Northeast.\n\nA crane unloads a shipping container of merchandise bound for CVS stores.\n\nUsed Toyotas hop a freighter for West Africa.\n\nThese are examples of the long-term vision, maybe decades away, that city and state officials have for a half-mile stretch of the Allens Avenue waterfront best known in recent years for strip clubs, zoning fights and failed redevelopment plans.\n\n\"A very small scrap operation and a series of dirt patches\" is how Bill Fischer, spokesman for ProvPort Inc., describes the land his organization hopes to transform.\n\nBut first, Rhode Island voters would need to endorse the state's vision in November by approving the $20-million purchase of up to 25 acres of property of Allens Avenue waterfront to expand the city’s port.\n\n\"Baby steps\" are what Chris Waterson, general manager of Waterson Terminal Services, calls the first phase of expanding the port his company operates.\n\nLooked at another way, city and state leaders want ProvPort to do for Allens Avenue what the Quonset Development Corporation is doing for the abandoned former Quonset Point Navy base in North Kingstown: turn underutilized land into a trade and employment hub.\n\n\"ProvPort is not a household name in Rhode Island,\" Fischer said. \"But this has been a very successful economic generator for the state, and we want to continue on that success. If we want to grow, it is not going to happen without additional land.\"   \n\nSome 1,700 people work at ProvPort, and the organization predicts the expansion would add another 300 jobs.\n\nNot coincidentally, ProvPort has hitched its state-backed expansion plan to an even larger proposed state investment in Quonset, where officials are asking for a $50-million state bond to repair piers at the Port of Davisville. The two bonds will appear as a package and pass or fail together on the upcoming ballot.\n\nNot everyone is convinced ProvPort should stretch down Allens Avenue.\n\n\"Moronic,\" Allens Avenue property owner Patrick Conley calls the idea of expanding ProvPort south of Thurbers Avenue. \"To bring an industrial waterfront so close to the city and hospital district, where there might be questions of air pollution and toxins emanating from industrial activity, is foolish.\"\n\nConley's own plans to redevelop part of the area as a commercial and entertainment center were foiled years ago by the Providence City Council's insistence that Allens Avenue remain purely industrial.\n\nBut even previous supporters of a mixed-use waterfront, such as Council President Luis Aponte, are getting behind a ProvPort expansion.\n\n\"I think a reasonable person could say the [current] activity down there is not the highest and best use on the Providence waterfront,\" said Aponte, who along with Mayor Jorge Elorza worked on the expansion plan. \"This proposal allows us to attract businesses that are not currently in the state ... and will provide jobs and an investment in this corridor.\"\n\nWhat is ProvPort?\n\nIn 1994, facing a budget crisis, then-Mayor Vincent A. \"Buddy\" Cianci Jr. turned to the more than 100 acres of city-owned industrial land at Fields Point to raise cash.\n\nWith the City Council's approval, he sold the land, which included the sleepy Municipal Wharf, for $16.5 million to an entity controlled by California financier Ray Meador, who agreed to manage the port.\n\nThe deal utilized some financial sleight of hand. Meador formed a nonprofit holding company called ProvPort to possess the land, then lease the property to the city-controlled Providence Redevelopment Agency, which issued tax-free bonds to pay the city and subleased the land back to ProvPort.\n\nThe \"sale\" would last for only 30 years, and then ownership would revert to the city. Port revenues were pledged to pay off the bond.\n\nThe upshot of the deal, which has been extended through 2036, is substantial city control over the port through the nonprofit ProvPort, while risk and income flow through to the for-profit operator, which has been Waterson Terminal Services since the port's longtime stevedore company merged with Meador's Public Asset Management in 2007.\n\nTwo of the five voting members on the ProvPort board are appointed by the city. The PRA approves ProvPort’s budget and has an ex-officio spot on the board.\n\nMeador, whose projects included arranging the financing for the ill-fated Wyatt Detention Center, in Central Falls, was not a marine trade expert, and the early years of ProvPort did not go well. By 2000, the city had chipped in $1.3 million to cover bond payments when port revenues came up short.\n\nWhile he doesn't endorse the practice of mortgaging city land to plug budget shortfalls, Elorza's chief of staff, Brett Smiley, said the public-private partnership with Waterson is \"advantageous\" for the city, which doesn't want to run the port itself.\n\nAnd now, headed for November's ballot, there's the $20-million bond proposal that would make the state a full partner in the operation. Here's how it would work:\n\nAn entity representing the state, probably the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, would negotiate with Allens Avenue property owners to acquire at least 15 acres from some combination of seven parcels. The two parcels closest to ProvPort, one home to the embattled Rhode Island Recycled Metals scrap yard and the other owned by Cumberland Farms, are at the top of the list.\n\nThen the state would enter into a long-term lease arrangement with ProvPort, so the nonprofit could store cargo on the land while marketing it to prospective tenants.\n\nFinally, the state would enter into a revenue-sharing arrangement for the new land similar to the city's arrangement with ProvPort. And it would get a seat on the ProvPort board.\n\nThe city receives 6 percent of the port's gross revenue (before bond payments or any other expenses). It also receives property taxes on ProvPort parcels as if they were owned by a private company. The taxes are paid by ProvPort on parcels it has not leased and by leaseholders on land they occupy.\n\nInitially, city officials had proposed to retain control of the newly acquired land, even though the state would be putting up the money to buy it. To compensate the state, ProvPort offered the state 8 percent of the revenue generated on the expansion parcels, with another 4 percent going to the city. The state would receive a projected $400,000 a year.  \n\nBut state officials, especially House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, balked at giving up ownership of the land, which brought negotiations to a standstill until the final week of the legislative session.\n\nCity leaders \"re-thought their position and there were 10 days left in the [General Assembly] session ... that started an avalanche of vetting where they wanted [Commerce Secretary Stefan] Pryor involved and we worked over the weekend,\" Fischer said. \"We weren’t trying to slip something into the budget in middle of night. Do I wish this happened in February? Yes.\"\n\nIn the end, the city's precarious fiscal position made self-financing the expansion untenable and ProvPort said adding major new debt would make it uncompetitive. So Elorza and Aponte agreed to state ownership of the port expansion.\n\nWith the ownership question settled, there were two main facets to the pitch that convinced Pryor and Mattiello that the state bond was a good idea.\n\nOne is that ProvPort's business has outgrown its home on Fields Point.\n\nThe state bond isn't intended to build any new wharves or docks, but provide more space for cargo storage in the short term and attract new tenants interested in building facilities in the longer term.\n\nOn a recent morning, Waterson pointed to Deepwater Wind turbine tower sections standing on one corner of the wharf and a pile of crushed limestone on another as an illustration of the tight quarters at the port. A new cement terminal is slated to open this summer, which will add more traffic to the area.\n\nProvPort leases land to nine tenants, whose businesses include cement, auto exports, chlorine manufacturing, salt, scrap metal and petroleum.\n\nIn 2015, the port handled 1.3 million tons of cargo. The top commodity passing through the port was salt, followed by scrap metal, cement, coal and caustic soda (an ingredient in chlorine).\n\nOf the $7.42 million in gross revenue ProvPort generated in 2015, a little more than half of it, $3.46 million, came from lease payments, while $3.43 million came from fees for security, dockage and use of the wharf. Waterson paid $519,000 to ProvPort for use of the new federally funded harbor crane.\n\nThen there is the long-term vision that, outlined in a report by consultants Vickerman & Associates, would encompass up to 60 acres and involve three new vessel berths along Allens Avenue.\n\nThat vision looks to take advantage of a long-theorized expansion in the East Coast shipping market driven by the June 26 opening of an expanded Panama Canal.\n\nPort officials expect the arrival of a new group of larger ships at the biggest East Coast ports to force smaller ships out to smaller ports, such as Providence.  \n\nOf particular interest to ProvPort, and highlighted by the Vickerman study, is the opportunity to import perishable foods to Providence, such as fresh fruit, if the port develops cold-storage warehouses.\n\nRhode Island is only one of the states scrambling to get a piece of this potential market, which has also been part of the pitch for further investment at Quonset.\n\nAsked whether the state's proposed expansions of both ports might lead to competition between them, Quonset spokesman David Preston said Davisville remains focused on auto imports and Providence is targeting other markets.\n\nCould the joining of the ProvPort and Quonset bond issues on the final night of the General Assembly’s session jeopardize both proposals in November?\n\n\"I don’t think it changes anything,\" Preston said.  \"It is a great opportunity for Rhode Island to upgrade not one but two ports.\"\n\nMassachusetts has committed $600 million to port improvement, including the $113 million spent to build New Bedford's Marine Commerce Terminal. Connecticut is investing $700 million over several years to improve ports at Bridgeport, New London and New Haven.\n\n\"We examined the claim ... that the port [in Providence] is running out of space and found it to be credible,\"  Pryor said about why he vouched for the bond question.\n\n\"We also examined the claim that there is a great deal of variability and volatility in the port economy globally in part due to the expansion of Panama Canal ... [and] we found these arguments to be well grounded in facts and credible,\" Pryor said. \"Other jurisdictions are making much larger investments.\"\n\nFinally, there is Allens Avenue itself, an environmentally challenged and increasingly unproductive gateway to the city that has been a battleground in a generation of mayoral campaigns.\n\nHaving excluded all but industrial uses, and seeing little private investment in those uses, the city finds state intervention an attractive option.\n\nAllens Avenue \"was a legitimate point of disagreement during mayor's race,\" Smiley said, referring to Elorza's campaign against Cianci, who supported a mix of uses there. \"It should be supporting the [marine] economy. There is only one 40-foot [deep] channel in Rhode Island and it is here.\"\n\n— panderson@providencejournal.com\n\n(401) 277-7384\n\nOn Twitter: @PatrickAnderso_\n",

    "passage": "_AN: Born from a conversation with Schattengestalt, this is just a bit out there. Enjoy it if you will. Not beta'd unless Yen or someone else lets me know in a PM what the issues are.\n_\n\n_Ree_\n\n_Wanted: Head of Hufflepuff House_\n\nAlbus Dumbledore settled back in his seat, his gaze drifting over his professors. For a moment he contemplated Severus Snape, his youngest professor, for the position that had just opened. True, Severus had only been teaching for three years, but the Potions Master had shown his ability to work under the worst circumstances. Hard work would be one of the main characteristics that would be needed to fill the position; to toil under any circumstance and to be loyal would also be welcome ones. Severus had shown all three of those traits.\n\nIt had happened in Severus' first year, the year that Voldemort was defeated. When the aurors had come to arrest his professor, Severus had collected his marking along with his writing supplies and had calmly walked out of Hogwarts. _'When they asked if he thought he could really do any writing while the Dementors were nearby, he had looked them in the eye and told them that fear wouldn't change his marking.'_\n\nAt Severus' trial Dumbledore had been surprised when an auror handed him a packet of marked essays. It was the way Severus had gracefully accepted being incarcerated and that he had insisted on completing his marking coupled with the quiet, respectful way he had sat chained into the prisoner's chair that had made Albus' task of freeing his professor that much simpler. Even Malfoy had sneered and scolded the Wizengamot. _'I was able to convince them Severus was a spy, but the thing that won them over to the idea that he was loyal to the side of the Light was the way that he accepted the possibility of punishment. They took it as a show of remorse, of understanding consequences of actions that they could not, or would not, believe that a loyal Death Eater could feel. So, they released him.'_\n\n\"We have one last thing that needs to be handled.\" Albus ran a hand down his beard. \"As you can see, Professor Sprout was not able to join us. Due to a family emergency, she will be unable to teach this school year. Professor Anthony Burl has agreed to take over her Herbology course, but will not be able to take on her Head of House duties. Anyone who wishes to take over those for this year, please leave a missive on my desk by tomorrow.\"\n\nConversation buzzed around the table, most discussing what the possible situations could be that was keeping Pomona away, the rest centred around who should be taking over her House.\n\nAlbus waited a few minutes before continuing. \"One more thing, I need any order changes by the morning. We are now done. Enjoy your afternoon.\"\n\n§§§§\n\nSeverus double checked the potions supply closets against his last year inventory sheets. When they checked out, he wrote up the list of needed supplies and headed off to deliver the list to Dumbledore.\n\n\"Burning Feathers.\" The gargoyle moved, and Severus passed through while attempting to forget just what that particular sweet tasted like. The door into the Headmaster's office opened as he reached it. For a moment he thought that Dumbledore knew he was there, but Archibald Griffith, the Ancient Runes Professor, stepped out and nodded to him as he left. Returning the greeting, Severus walked into the office, his list in hand.\n\n\"Headmaster, here are my order changes.\" Severus held out a parchment scroll, which Dumbledore accepted and put on a stack. Turning on his heel, he prepared to leave.\n\n\"Severus, if you would wait a moment.\" Albus let a small smile out as the young man faced him, his exasperation only momentarily visible on his face before he schooled it. \"I would like you to apply for the Head of Hufflepuff position.\"\n\nIt was the knowledge that he would lose his chance of Severus agreeing that kept back Albus' laughter at the shocked expression that currently covered the Potions Master's face.\n\nSeverus folded his arms, his eyes narrowing. \"What? Me? Dumbledore, I was in Slytherin. Surely you remember that.\"\n\nAlbus closed his office door and leaned against it. \"I am aware of that. Professor Griffith just informed me that he will not be returning next year. I would like you to be replace him as the Head of Slytherin, but there is no way I can give that position to someone with as little experience as you have. If you spent this year as a Head of House, then I could easily move you over to the Slytherin Head of House position next year.\"\n\nAlbus waited while Severus thought through his offer. Even though he was sad that Griffith was leaving, he was pleased that he had this piece of leverage to get Severus to think about taking the position.\n\n\"I will consider it, sir.\" Severus walked towards the door. He was glad when Dumbledore moved, opening the door as he did so.\n\nAlbus watched as the man walked away, deep in thought. \"Please let me know tomorrow morning, Severus.\"\n\n§§§§\n\n'_What would I get out of being a Head of House?'_\n\nThat question had been bouncing about in Severus' head since he had left the Headmaster's office. It seemed to be echoing off the stone walls, rebounding off the ceiling and floors, bouncing down the stairs as he walked down them, and even the portraits seemed to be murmuring it as he passed them on his way to his laboratory. No matter how much he heard the question, an answer never came. What was worse was that he was sure he would be a bad Head of House.\n\n'_The Head of House is supposed to be a parental figure. Taking care of those students sorted into their group … their family. I did not have a good example of a parental figure, and I never warmed up enough to Slughorn to learn from him how to complete the task. It would be foolish of me to even contemplate taking this on. Especially for a house I am not even a former member of. I doubt I would be a good replacement for Griffith next year.'_\n\nPushing the matter out of his mind, Severus entered his laboratory, and checking the list of potions that Madame Pomfrey needed, he noticed he had an entire evening of brewing. This was not something that would change. Potions Masters were too busy to handle being the Head of House. Someone else would take up the open position, not only this year's, but next year's as well. There were others far more qualified than him. Others that at least could show they cared. Pushing all thoughts of Head of Houses and Headmasters out of his mind once again, he settled in to start brewing.\n\nHours later, Severus arranged the vials and flasks of the needed potions. His fingers ghosted over the multicoloured containers with pleasure. This is what he excelled at. His potions were the only ones to receive and understand his caring. They didn't demand overt displays; they didn't need to be reassured. No, they glowed and sparkled in their containers content that he made them. _'Children would not understand. They would demand more attention no matter which house they were part of. They would deserve it as well.'_\n\nA sigh escaped him as he started cleaning up. It wasn't until he was elbow deep in sudsy water scrubbing the worst cauldron that a new thought entered his mind. _'Why does Dumbledore want me to be the Head of Hufflepuff?'_\n\nThe question turned over and answers surfaced with each scrubbing motion.\n\n'_He wants someone that he trusts.'_ Severus dismissed that idea fast. He didn't doubt Dumbledore trusted him, but he didn't think it was with children. The man had called him on the carpet more than once about his teaching persona.\n\n'_He doesn't think the others have time to take this task on and do it right.'_ That was completely out there. He had more to do with brewing along with his other teaching responsibilities than the others who were not already a Head of House.\n\n'_So, why does Dumbledore want me to take this position? Can it truly be because he wants me to be the Head of Slytherin house next year? Why would he want me there? It would put me in a position of power over the children of my fellow Death Eaters.'_ His eyes widened slightly and his hands stopped moving. That was it. He would have an influence on those children. The other Death Eaters would know he was a spy, Dumbledore's spy, and their children would as well. They would see that there might be a different path besides following their parents' footsteps. _'Dumbledore insists the Dark Lord is not truly gone. Maybe he wants me to show those children they do not have to be good little followers, that they can learn to think for themselves – hopefully before they are marked beyond redemption.'_\n\nRinsing out the cauldron, he moved to the next one while his mind churned over that idea. _'If I could influence them, maybe … just maybe it would be worth attempting to be a Head of House.'_\n\nScrubbing the sludge out of his smallest cauldron, Severus tried to imagine how he could be an effective Head of House.\n\n§§§§\n\nThe parchment on his desk was still blank. Severus held his quill in his hand, the ink darkening its tip, as he contemplated what to write. The only words that were coming to mind, the only reason he could think of for the Headmaster to accept him as the Head of Hufflepuff, was that Albus Dumbledore had requested he do so.\n\nAll last night he had pondered how he could become worthy of the position. How he could show he could be trusted with children directly under his care, to be the person for them to go to if they had problems. Not a single thought had come to him. Not one plan. All that kept playing through his mind was he could not be like his parents, he could not be like Slughorn – that man had been good for a select group of the students in Slytherin but not all. He wanted to be like Dumbledore, but not exactly – there was a time or two in his memory where the Headmaster did not have his best interest at heart. So, he was left with a blank parchment, staring at it, wishing to take Dumbledore up on his offer, but having no clue how to do so, much less write out that he did.\n\nFinally, the quill lowered and Severus wrote the only thing he was capable of. _I would appreciate the chance to become the temporary Head of Hufflepuff. I would do my best to help each child succeed._\n\nAs he walked the missive to the Headmaster's office, Severus decided if Dumbledore accepted him, he would talk to McGonagall, Flitwick and Griffith about how they worked with their houses. It would give him a starting point.\n\n§§§§\n\nAlbus looked at the stack of parchments that littered his desk. One was letters that needed to be replied to, another was Ministry and Board messages and notes, and another was the inner school related paperwork. The one that held his attention was the small stack sitting right in the centre. These were the volunteers for the Head of House position.\n\nPicking up the top one, he noticed that it was Septima Vector who offered her services. Scanning through her letter, Albus could see she would be a good replacement, but wondered if she would be willing to move into the dungeon to be near the dormitory. Albus knew that she had never cared for that level, preferring to be on the seventh floor. The third floor was her other preferred floor, which was where her current sleeping quarters were. The Arithmancer did not care for negative numbers, and that was what the floor below the ground level represented.\n\nSetting her letter aside, Albus picked up the only other one there. _'Please, let this be Severus.'_\n\nBreaking the seal, he unrolled the parchment and a small smile curved his lips. It was written in Severus' hand writing. It took him no time to read the two sentences, but the second one was all he needed to see. Severus would work to see the students succeed, and next year, he would be able to have a Head of Slytherin that would understand that house better than anyone had in years.\n\nAlbus knew the Slytherin house was facing dark days, worse than any living wizard could remember. Ever since the end of the war, people saw those who entered it as dark wizards and would possible punish them just for being Slytherin. Severus would understand what was happening, and would be able to help those children hold their head up, just as he, himself, had learned to. He would also guard their backs and hopefully help to keep some of them out of Voldemort's grip when he came back.\n\nLetting the parchment roll back up, he sat it on top of Vector's. He would talk to them both after breakfast to let them know what his decision was.\n",

    "passage": "North Carolina Republican Party\n\nThe NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY (NCGOP) is the affiliate of the Republican Party in North Carolina. Michael Whatley was elected Chairman of the party on June 8, 2019.\n\n\nHistory\n\nNineteenth century\n\nAlthough Republicans first nominated a candidate for President of the United States, John C. Fremont, in 1856,[1] the party was not established in North Carolina until 1867, after the Civil War. With the help of the newly enfranchised freedmen, Republicans were briefly successful in state politics, dominating the convention that wrote the Constitution of North Carolina of 1868 and electing several governors.[2] After Reconstruction, Democrats returned to power, often suppressing the black vote by violence and fraud. Republicans had success in the 1890s when they joined forces with the Populist party in an “electoral fusion.” They gained enough seats in the legislature to control it in 1896, and elected Daniel L. Russell as governor in 1896.[3][4][5]\n\nTwentieth century\n\nTo prevent this kind of challenge, after Democrats regained control of the state legislature, in 1900 they adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which required prepayment of a poll tax and an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied), and lengthened the residence period required before registration. A grandfather clause exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867, which limited exemptions to white men.[6] These barriers to voter registration caused a dramatic drop in the number of African-American voters in the state by 1904, although they constituted one-third of the population.[7] An estimated 75,000 black male citizens lost the vote.[8][9]\n\nWith North Carolina a one-party Democratic state of the Solid South following the disfranchisement of blacks, North Carolina Republicans struggled to survive as a party during the first half of the twentieth century. African Americans were virtually excluded from the political system in the state until the late 1960s. In 1928 Republicans carried the state's electoral votes for president (for candidate Herbert Hoover).[10] White members of the Republican Party generally lived in the Piedmont near Charlotte and Winston-Salem, and the mountains in the western part of the state. In 1952 Charles R. Jonas was elected to Congress from the western part of the state as the first Republican since before the Great Depression. He was joined in 1962 by Jim Broyhill. From this base, and nearly winning the electoral votes for the state in the Presidential elections from 1952 to 1960, the party began to grow.\n\nAs in other southern states, in the late 20th century, white conservatives began to shift from the Democratic Party to the Republican one, especially after national Democratic leaders supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. White conservatives first voted for Republican presidential candidates. From 1968 through 2004, the majority of North Carolina voters supported Republicans in every presidential election, except 1976, when favorite son Democrat Jimmy Carter was elected from Georgia.[11] When they re-entered the political system, African Americans shifted their alliance from the Republican to the Democratic Party, which had national leaders who had supported the civil rights effort and legislation enforcing their constitutional rights as citizens.\n\nIn 1972, Republicans became competitive in statewide elections for the first time since 1900: James Holshouser was elected Governor of the state, and Jesse Helms, a former Democrat who held office for a long time, was elected to the U.S. Senate.[12] Jack Lee, who was elected state party chairperson in 1977, is widely credited with unifying the North Carolina Republican Party in this period.[13][14]\n\nThe parties were generally competitive, with the state's voters split between them, through much of the rest of the 20th century.\n\nTwenty-first century\n\nThe elections of 2010 led to Republican control of both houses of the North Carolina General Assembly for the first time since 1896[15] when it had gained success in a fusionist campaign with the Populist Party.\n\nThe state legislature's redistricting of congressional districts has been challenged in several lawsuits for racial gerrymandering, which are still in progress in 2016.\n\nIn 2012, Republicans retained control of the legislature and elected two Republicans, Pat McCrory and Dan Forest, as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, respectively. Most of the other Council of State offices (the Governor and Lieutenant Governor are Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively) were won by Democratic candidates. (The other Republicans are Cherie K. Berry, Commissioner of Labor and Steve Troxler, Commissioner of Agriculture.)\n\n\nParty platform\n\nThe most recent version of the North Carolina Republican platform was released on June 7, 2013. It contains ten articles and was formed by 13 district representatives and 3 Republican chair members.[16]\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans passed laws in 2016 to order the transgender people to use their bathrooms according to their original sex. On March 23, 2016, Governor McCrory signed the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act (commonly known as House Bill 2 or HB2), which has been described as the most anti-LGBT legislation in the United States.[17][18][19][20] One contentious element of the law eliminates and forbids cities to re-establish anti-discrimination protections for gay, transgender, and intersex people.[21] The law also legislates that in government buildings, people may only use restrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates,[22] which has been criticized because it prevents transgender people who do not or cannot alter their birth certificates from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity.[23]\n\nThe party supports free enterprise economics with little government regulation and taxation.[24]\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans have been criticized for their support of the death penalty, as studies have shown it has been disproportionately applied to racial minorities. In an effort to repeal the Racial Justice Act, North Carolina Republicans introduced a bill that would essentially veto the act passed in 2009.[25] In June 2013, North Carolina's governor Pat McCrory signed the repeal of the Racial Justice Act, saying that the law was essentially a ban on capital punishment in the state.[26]\n\nEnglish should be the official language of the United States.[27]\n\n\nCurrent elected officials\n\nThe party controls six of the ten statewide Council of State offices and holds a majority in both the North Carolina House of Representatives and the North Carolina Senate. Republicans also hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats and 8 of the state's 13 U.S. House seats.\n\nWhen the Republican-controlled legislature conducted redistricting in 2011, it established districts biased toward Republicans. As a result, although more voters chose Democratic congressional candidates in the state in 2012 than Republican, the Republicans took a majority of the seats. The redistricting has been challenged in legal cases going before the Supreme Court.[28]\n\nMembers of Congress\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nRepublicans have controlled both of North Carolina's seats in the U.S. Senate since 2014:\n\n-   Class II: THOM TILLIS (_Junior Senator_)[Junior Senator Tillis]\n-   Class III: RICHARD BURR (_Senior Senator_, _Chair of Senate Intelligence Committee_)[Senior Senator Burr]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nOut of the 13 seats North Carolina is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, 10 are held by Republicans:\n\n-   NC-02: GEORGE HOLDING\n-   NC-03: GREG MURPHY\n-   NC-05: VIRGINIA FOXX\n-   NC-06: MARK WALKER\n-   NC-07: DAVID ROUZER\n-   NC-08: RICHARD HUDSON\n-   NC-09: DAN BISHOP\n-   NC-10: PATRICK MCHENRY\n-   NC-13: TED BUDD\n\nStatewide offices\n\nRepublicans control six of the ten elected statewide offices:\n\n-   Lieutenant Governor: DAN FOREST\n-   Commissioner of Agriculture: STEVE TROXLER\n-   Commissioner of Insurance: MIKE CAUSEY\n-   Commissioner of Labor: CHERIE BERRY\n-   Superintendent of Public Instruction: MARK JOHNSON\n-   Treasurer: DALE FOLWELL\n\nNorth Carolina General Assembly\n\n-   Senate President Pro Tempore: PHIL BERGER\n    -   Senate Majority Leader: HARRY BROWN\n-   Speaker of the House: TIM MOORE\n    -   Speaker Pro Tempore: SARAH STEVENS\n    -   House Majority Leader: MIKE HAGER\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/detail?vid=2&hid=102&sid=f21d52b3-ac19-4eb87b-036eaad362b9%40sessionmgr114&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=f5h&AN=39024661\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] Richard H.

    "passage": "[Former US Secretary of State John Kerry. Photo: State Department.]\n\nFormer US Secretary of State John Kerry. Photo: State Department.\n\nOn November 16, 2014, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took the unusual step of designating the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and the Muslim American Society (MAS) as terrorist organizations.\n\nThey were among 83 groups named for their connections to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThis outraged CAIR officials, who immediately began efforts to get their organization removed from the list. They found a powerful ally in Secretary of State John Kerry, who authorized State Department officials to meet regularly with UAE officials to lobby on behalf of CAIR and MAS.\n\nCAIR already had a sympathetic ear in the Obama administration, including the State Department, which had openly embraced and legitimized the entire spectrum of radical Islamist groups falsely posing as religious or civil rights groups, which both CAIR and MAS had done.\n\n\nRelated coverage\n\n[]\n\nNovember 30, 2020 1:41 pm\n\nAt a daily State Department press briefing two days after the UAE released its list, a spokesman said that the State Department did not “consider CAIR or MAS to be terrorist groups” but that it was seeking more information from UAE about their decision. The official added that “as part of our routine engagement with a broad spectrum of faith based organizations, a range of US government officials have met with officials of CAIR and MAS. We at the State Department regularly meet with a wide range of faith based groups to hear their views even if some of their views expressed at times are controversial.”\n\nIn making that admission, the State Department official effectively affirmed the Obama administration policy of embracing radical Islamist group under the euphemism of calling them “faith based groups.”\n\nThe UAE had good reason to designate CAIR as a terror organization. For instance, records obtained by the FBI indicate that CAIR was created as a front group for a Hamas support network. While CAIR bills itself as “the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization,” the reality is quite different.\n\nBefore helping launch CAIR, Executive Director Nihad Awad worked as public relations director for the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), a Hamas propaganda arm in the United States. A 2001 Immigration and Naturalization Service memo documented IAP’s support for Hamas and found that the “facts strongly suggest” that IAP was “part of Hamas’ propaganda apparatus.”\n\nIAP was part of the “Palestine Committee,” created by the Muslim Brotherhood to support Hamas politically and financially. CAIR was added to the Palestine Committee’s roster just after its 1994 creation.\n\nIn 2008, the FBI cut off official contact with CAIR, citing evidence from the Holy Land Foundation terror funding trial, which documented the connections between CAIR and its founders to Hamas.\n\nIn a letter to Senator Jon Kyl, the FBI explained, “Until we [the FBI] can resolve whether there continues to be a connection between CAIR or its executives and HAMAS, the FBI does not view CAIR as an appropriate liaison partner.”\n\nDuring a 2003 Senate hearing, Senator Charles Schumer, D-NY, said that CAIR is known “to have ties to terrorism.” In 2009 correspondence with the FBI, he wrote that cutting off contact with the Islamist group “should be government-wide policy.”\n\nCAIR and its representatives, meanwhile, often espouse radical ideology and propagate the jihadist narrative that the United States is waging a “war on Islam.” Awad repeated that message as recently as September 2016, when he denounced legislation allowing the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.\n\nCAIR officials also often side with Hamas and other Palestinian terrorists.\n\nCAIR-New York board member Lamis Deek, an attorney, tweeted during the 2012 war between Israel and Hamas that Gaza is a “beacon of resistance, exposes shackles, awakens dignity, inspires revolution, reaffirms our oneness – the reason ‘israel’ won’t last.”\n\nDuring a 2009 fundraiser for an effort to break Israel’s embargo against the Hamas government in Gaza, Deek explained that Palestinian support for Hamas is a choice for “one united Palestinian state on all of the 1948 territories from the north to the very south. That is what Palestinians chose. And in supporting Palestinian choice we are saying we support their right to liberation from violent colonialism.”\n\nJust days before the UAE’s 2014 designation of CAIR as a terrorist group, the organization’s San Francisco chapter bestowed its “Promoting Justice” award to Sami Al-Arian and his family. Al-Arian secretly ran an American support network for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorist group in the late 1980s and early 1990s. PIJ was responsible for terrorist attacks that killed dozens of Israelis and several Americans.\n\nAl-Arian pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide goods or services to the PIJ. His plea agreement included an admission that he was associated with the PIJ. US District Judge James S. Moody went further in sentencing Al Arian: “The evidence was clear in this case that you were a leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” Moody said. “You were on the board of directors and an officer, the secretary. Directors control the actions of an organization, even the PIJ; and you were an active leader.”\n\nSince 2001, six CAIR officials have been convicted of terror-related charges. A longtime national board member was deported in part because of his Hamas support.\n\nYet despite the massive evidence linking CAIR to Hamas and other terror groups, the Obama administration repeatedly invited CAIR officials and other radical Islamist groups to the White House.\n\nIn December 2014, CAIR met with top officials of the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, asking them to pressure the UAE to remove them from the list, according to reliable sources intimately familiar with the communications. On December 22, 2014, CAIR issued a press release asserting that “the two American Muslim organizations and the US government pledged to work together to achieve a positive solution to the UAE designations.”\n\nIn response to a letter sent by CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad to Secretary Kerry protesting the UAE designation, Kerry responded on May 5, 2015, in a letter to Awad stating, “Let me reiterate, first, that the US government clearly does not consider CAIR to be a terrorist organization. As your letter noted, the Department of State rejected this allegation immediately after the UAE designations were announced in November, and we will continue to do so. … US officials have raised the issue of CAIR’s inclusion on the UAE’s terror list with UAE officials on multiple occasions…”\n\nThat portion of the letter now appears on CAIR’s website. But at the time that the letter was sent to CAIR, according to knowledgeable sources, there was an agreement between CAIR and the State Department to keep the letter secret. An excerpt from it was posted on CAIR’s website only in May 2016, a year after it was received. The IPT has learned that Kerry and CAIR agreed to keep the letter secret so as to protect Kerry from public embarrassment. In light of CAIR’s numerous ties to Hamas and other unsavory aspects of its record, Kerry had good reason to believe that the letter could cause a public relations disaster for him.\n\nWhatever influence the State Department exerted on the UAE did not work. There has been no indication that CAIR and MAS were removed from the Gulf state’s terrorist list.\n\nWhen the UAE list was published, CAIR realized that it was going to be a public relations disaster for them as well. So they published a FAQ attacking the UAE as a “politically ‘authoritarian’ regime.”\n\nThe organization seemed more comfortable with this authoritarian regime in 2006, when Awad and CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper led a delegation on a fundraising trip to the UAE. State Department cables show that the delegation, led by the public relations firm Hill and Knowlton, sought millions of dollars from UAE donors.\n\nThe cables, obtained by the IPT through the Freedom of Information Act, show that CAIR officials met with top UAE leaders and attended an evening reception “in honor of the CAIR group” hosted by a top presidential adviser. The cable also noted that “UAE press has reported that Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid al-Makhtoum Deputy Ruler of Dubai and UAE Minister of Finance and Industry, ‘has endorsed a proposal to build a property in the US to serve as an endowment for CAIR.'” The cable added that CAIR had already received substantial contributions from several wealthy UAE donors, including one who had already given CAIR $1 million.\n\nThe Muslim American Society, meanwhile, has its own lengthy record of defending accused terrorists and terror supporters. It was formed as the Muslim Brotherhood’s overt arm in the United States. Co-founder Abdurrahman Alamoudi, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to engaging in illegal transactions with Libya and facilitating a Libyan plot to assassinate then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, testified in 2012 that MAS’s connection with the Brotherhood cannot be disputed.\n\nThis sordid episode of going to bat for a Hamas-support organization is emblematic of the larger problem of the Obama’s Administration’s inability to pinpoint the heart of the impasse between the Palestinians and the Israelis: unceasing Palestinian terrorism, continued Palestinian subsidies paid to terrorist families, incendiary glorification of terrorists who kill Jews and massive antisemitic incitement in Palestinian schools and media.\n\nThe outgoing Secretary of State recently crowed in the _New York Times_ about what he got right. This episode is a stark example of what he got wrong.\n",

It prepares the annual budget for the Government,[1] and also handles taxation, customs and excise, economic affairs, information systems, internal audit, currency and the census in the Isle of Man.\n\nThe Minister for the Treasury is Alfred Cannan MHK.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Finance Board was established in 1962, although the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man functioned as Chancellor of the Exchequer and gave the budget speech in Tynwald until the 1970s.\n\nFrom 1765 to 1979, the collection of customs revenues in the Isle of Man was undertaken by UK Customs and Excise staff. From 1980, under the terms of the Customs and Excise Agreement of 1979 with the UK, the collection of customs revenue has been undertaken by Manx civil servants. The current Customs and Excise Agreement covers customs duties and many other (but not all) indirect taxes. The agreement, which is backed by both UK and Manx legislation, means that for VAT, customs and most (but not all) excise duty purposes the 2 territories are treated as if 1. Most of these indirect taxes and duties are pooled and shared. This negates the need for customs barriers between the 2 countries. Manx legislation exists which mirrors the equivalent UK law where required.[2]\n\nIn 1986 the Finance Board was abolished and its functions transferred to the Treasury as part of the reorganisation of the Isle of Man Government on a ministerial basis.\n\n\nFunctions\n\n-   Budget\n-   Taxation\n-   National Insurance\n-   Investments and Banking\n-   Economic Advice and Statistical Analysis\n-   Capital Projects Unit\n-   Internal Audit\n-   Pay and Payments\n-   Insolvency Office\n-   Rates\n-   Valuations\n\n\nIsle of Man Customs and Excise\n\nCustoms and Excise operates from Douglas, situated by the steam railway station with approximately 55 staff cover all aspects of Customs and Excise work. There are approximately 9,000 traders currently registered for VAT in the Isle of Man and this figure is steadily growing, reflecting the interest shown on the Island as a business centre. On average more than 100 new applications to register are received per month. The service aims to register new traders within 7 days of application, provided all the relevant information has been provided.\n\nCustoms and Excise Division also has important law enforcement functions to perform and these duties can range from the investigation of local customs offences such as bootlegging of alcohol and tobacco and drug smuggling into and out of the Isle of Man through to assisting other jurisdictions with the investigation of international money laundering.\n\nIn the area of financial crime the Division works closely with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and currently there are intelligence officers and investigation officers working with their police colleagues at the FIU\n\nThe Division's law enforcement work contributes to the Chief Minister's Drug and Alcohol Strategy, which complement its performance of the more traditional customs work including attendance at ports and the airport, dealing with passengers, examining freight, courier and postal packets, road fuel testing and excise visiting. In most of these areas officers are seeking to seize offending items and to disrupt those that try to bring into the Island prohibited or restricted goods, which include drugs, alcohol, tobacco, weapons, paedophile materials and endangered species or meat products. Where prohibitions are broken the division has close working and intelligence sharing with the Isle of Man Constabulary\n\nThe Division also operates a 7.5 metre trailer based rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) bought using the seized proceeds of illegal activities[3]\n\nPreviously the Division had a Cutter 'Panther' that was gifted to Sierra Leone to be used for fisheries enforcement[4]\n\nIn addition to its customs role relating to import and export prohibitions and restrictions the Division is responsible for administration of export licensing and export controls, these being in addition to controls on the removal of cultural items administered by Manx National Heritage.

    "passage": "[Flickr / Chris Rice]\nFlickr / Chris Rice\n“Payback’s a bitch,” Paul said.\n\nHe smiled to himself and continued packing. We were both 16-years-old at the time, but he already towered over me at 6’2″. At times like those I was almost glad that he was my friend. But it also meant that I couldn’t refuse being accomplice to his schemes.\n\nI told my parents I was going to be staying at his house for the night, and his parents didn’t give a shit where we went. We packed up a sleeping bag and some clothes and were out the door shortly after 9PM, heading to one of our old Salt Cedar tree forts on the fringe of his neighborhood.\n\n“At midnight, we’ll hit Tim’s house,” he explained as we walked down the unlit road. Floating just over the mountain horizon, the moon looked twice its normal size. “That kid’s been trying to get me in trouble ever since junior high.”\n\nHe wasn’t wrong, I had been there during gym the day before. At lunch, they served pumpkin pie that tasted like hell, so Paul went around gathering plates of it from people who didn’t finish. After the period let out, we found pieces of pie decorating the walls outside the building.\n\nThe only person besides Paul who was missing from gym class was Tim. So we knew what Tim’s little smirk meant when the principal came and hauled Paul out of fifth period. And when everyone found him, standing on a ladder and cleaning the pie off the walls, Tim was there with his phone out, recording it.\n\n“What are you going to do to him?” I asked.\n\nWe had our flashlights out now. The yellow beams knifed through the tall grass and the desert landscape. I could see the dark shape of the Salt Cedar, outlined like a crouching giant in the distance. It had been our home away from home ever since I met Paul in elementary school. We met each other because of a play date our parents arranged. If it wasn’t for that, I would’ve been just another one of the many people he took his frustrations out on.\n\n“I don’t know yet,” he said. “Figured I’d give him a few choices and let him decide for himself how he wants to be punished. The punishment’s got to fit the crime. Narkdom is a very serious offense, Brent.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen we reached the Cedar, we got a nice fire going in the center of the clearing. It was old and the trunks grew out far enough to allow a mid-section to be completely open, yet covered the sky in the canopy of needles. It was then that I first saw the black duffel bag that Paul had brought. He pulled forth a bunch of weird looking tools and he revealed a long piece of rope.\n\nI asked him what they were, but he simply smiled and said I would find out later. We left the fire burning and made back for the housing area where Tim lived. Somehow, Paul knew which window looked into his bedroom, because we crouched below an illuminated square of glass, and waited quietly. Paul reached up and knocked twice.\n\nThe square of light shining onto the ground intensified as the shades were pulled aside. But a moment later, they were shut again. Paul knocked another time. I could feel Tim’s presence above us, looking out through the window and wondering what was going on. Finally, the window creaked open and he stuck his head out.\n\nPaul reached up and threw one hand over his mouth, yanking him from the window with his free arm. The full weight of the situation hit me. We were _kidnapping_ him. _This is kidnap,_ my mind shouted.\n\nStill, without thinking, I handed Paul the bandana and rope and watched as he expertly bound Tim’s hands behind his back and covered his face.\n\n“Shut the fuck up and walk if you don’t want to die,” he said in a low menacing voice.\n\nPaul had to walk backwards in order to keep Tim hoisted up and one hand over his mouth. So I led the way, both flashlights in my hands. I was terrified someone would come upon us, but I almost wished that someone would. I wanted someone to catch us and stop this before it got out of hand. Paul was known for being a bully, but even I could not predict what he was going to do to this guy. And for what? For having to clean up pie he had thrown at the wall?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fire was still alive by the time we made it back into the center of the Salt Cedar. When Paul took his bandana off, Tim’s eyes were wide and horror struck. But he didn’t look at us, instead he gazed wildly around the center of the tree fort.\n\n“If you try yelling, I’ll make you regret it,” Paul said.\n\nHe slumped Tim on the ground beside one of the twisting trunks and tied his hands behind his back, wrapping his arms around the trunk. Then, he took the bandana out of his mouth.\n\n“We can’t be here!” Tim shouted.\n\nPaul threw all of his weight into his punch as he struck Tim in the jaw. I heard a sickening pop.\n\n“Why can’t we be here?” I asked. “And be quiet about it.”\n\n“This is the Bleeding Hollow,” he said, more quietly.\n\nPaul and I both laughed. “We’ve been coming here for years,” I told him. _“This is our home.”_\n\n“…but have you ever stayed the night here?” he asked, blood flowing from his mouth.\n\nAs a matter of fact we hadn’t, but we never said that. Paul just looked at me with a condescending smile and walked back to his tool bag. By the way Tim was looking at me, I could tell he was going to try to prey on me as the weak link. He knew I wasn’t hard like Paul.\n\n“Is this about the pie?” Tim asked. Paul looked up and nodded at him. “My dad’s the janitor, you asshole. _What else did you expect?_ For me to let him pick up after your stupid, shitty pranks?”\n\n“Why is this place called the Bleeding Hollow?” I asked him, ignoring his pleas.\n\n“Oh, you don’t know?” he asked, turning his attention to me. “This is the perfect place for homeless people to come and stay the night. If it wasn’t cursed, there would be an entire mob of them here, for all of the bum population we have in town.” He looked at me in complete seriousness. “But they don’t. Because they can’t, dumbass.”\n\n“Why can’t they?”\n\n“Well, they _can_,” he iterated. “They did in the past. But they all wind up dead.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“The fuck do I look like, the village herald or —”\n\nHe was cut short by Paul’s fist again. Paul wasn’t the brightest, but I could see the wheels were moving in his eyes now. He was intrigued.\n\n“Answer his question,” he said. “The best you can.”\n\n_“Because,_” he said, resentment now curdling in his voice. “They all started killing each other. Every time. The police came out here four times and found a bloodbath here four times. Now, no one even tries to come here. Except for you idiots.”\n\nPaul was still skeptical, I could tell. But something about the authority in Tim’s voice had me unnerved. Still, Paul sauntered back to his black bag and pulled forth something that looked like a pointed pair of pliers. He clamped them threateningly at Tim.\n\n“I think you’re full of it,” he said.\n\nJust then we heard the sound of a twig snapping outside the treeline. I thought for a moment that I had glimpsed headlights streaming through the branches. A deep, gruff voice called out to us:\n\n“We know you boys are in there! Where is Timothy?”\n\nPaul cursed and dropped his tool back into the bag. He told me to stay and that he would take care of it. But how? I didn’t believe that he could. The man sounded like a police officer or something. Suddenly I saw myself in the juvenile detention center, explaining to my parents why we were in the wilderness, holding a boy hostage.\n\nI looked up and caught Tim’s gaze. “You know what you have to do,” he said. “If you untie me now, I can run the other way and explain that this was all just an accident. You don’t need to go down for Paul’s mistake.”\n\nI couldn’t refuse his offer. Paul may have grown accustomed to this kind of thing, but my record was clean and I was determined to keep it that way. So I slid down beside Tim and untied the rope around his hands. He nodded at me and ran off in the opposite direction that Paul had gone.\n\nOnly moments after he had left the sprawling glow of the fire, Paul re-emerged, looking perplexed.\n\n“No one is out there,” he said. His eyes found me, kneeling down where Tim was just moments ago. “What the hell, man?”\n\n“It sounded like the police,” I explained.\n\nFor years we had been friends, and I’d never seen Paul look so furious as he did then. He looked like he was considering taking the tools to me now. I rose up and tried to explain further, but before I could begin, Tim popped back into the clearing. He looked even more confused than Paul.\n\n“How?” he stammered. “How did I wind up here again?”\n\nWith a last terrified glance at me and Paul, he sped off the direction he had come. But how could he have gotten lost? The sprawl of the Salt Cedar was big, but not that big. It was just several long paces from the center and you were out. Still, Tim came back upon the clearing, this time beside me. Meanwhile, Paul was frozen in disbelief.\n\nTim looked like he was going to cry. “I swear to God!” he growled. “I swear to God I ran for the exit.” Boldly, he took a step towards Paul, explaining, “I didn’t make a turn. _I should be out of the fort_.”\n\nHis features waxed pale beneath the firelight. Realization struck his watery eyes.\n\n“The Bleeding Hollow,” he said.\n\n“Bullshit,” said Paul, taking a step towards him.\n\nBut before he could reach him, Timothy dove for the duffel bag. He pulled out an old, rusted machete. Tim wielded it fiercely, telling Paul to stay away.\n\n“You packed _a machete_?” I asked him.\n\n“Just shut the fuck up, both of you,” Tim said. “I’m in charge now. And I know how the legend goes…”\n\nAs Tim spoke, I felt like the lights in my mind were flickering off and on. It was almost as if my eyes were blinking for minutes at a time. Everything before me was snapping in and out of focus. And his words were breaking off and burst forth, almost as though someone were covering and then uncovering my ears.\n\nThen I heard a sound like a whisper. I jumped when it came, but I found no one beside me. Meanwhile, Paul and Tim were speaking to each other in words I could not hear. All I heard was the low muttering coming from I know not where.\n\n“Listen to me,” said the voice. “I’ll show you the way out. You do not need to die here with them. You do not belong here.”\n\nAnd I did listen, numb and barely conscious. The voice was like a lullaby singing me into a soft kind of daydream. I turned where I stood and walked away from the center of the Salt Cedar, into the churning darkness.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing I remember after that was a long, vivid dream. I dreamt I was floating inches off the ground, over the roots and the weeds of the Salt Cedar. The night air felt cool and cleansing as I left the clearing. I turned, still hovering, and a hole opened up into the exterior of the fort.\n\nThrough the hole, I saw Tim and Paul, standing several feet away from each other and yelling. All the while, Paul was moving deft hands over the rope, twisting it into knots and turns. As I watched him, I too felt a rope in my hands. I was mirroring his actions. I watched as Paul finished the rope and slung it over a high hanging tree branch, and then started climbing.\n\nAs he climbed, Tim was still talking wildly. They seemed oblivious to the actions they were performing. Even as Tim started digging a hole in the ground and solidifying the handle of the machete into it, with the blade turned up, did he speak aggressively to Paul.\n\nI remember floating farther away from the scene. As I did, I saw a body drop from the branches. I saw a body fall straight down onto the ground. Then, I awoke.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSirens were going off around me. Daylight was bleeding through the branches. The outside world was slowly encroaching on me and I was aware of the hard dirt beneath me. Slowly, I lifted myself up and I found that I was lying directly in the center of the Salt Cedar.\n\nPaul’s body was dangling from a tree branch overhead. His neck snapped and his feet swung loose as he slowly turned clockwise, then counter-clockwise. He was attached to the branch by a noose fashioned out of the same rope he had packed last night. Just a few feet away was Tim, slumped down with his back arched, the bladed tip of the machete splitting his skin open wide. The handle was bored into the ground. They were both dead.\n\n“_Ho-ley shit,_ not again,” came a loud voice. It sounded the same as the voice we had heard last night; the one that Paul had gone out to investigate. “Guys, in here. The neighbors were right, someone else found their way here.”\n\nAs the officer approached, he looked at me almost as though he expected to find me there. He had long, braided hair and brown skin that was dried like tree bark. I realized I had seen him before at family gatherings. His family name was Sitting Wolf.\n\nThe other officers poured into the fort behind him and approached the bodies. Meanwhile, the man I recognized came up to me and spoke in a hushed tone, crouching in front of me.\n\n“I knew your great uncle, Sheshone,” he said, putting a big hand on my shoulder. “You have the blood of the Mojave Tribe in you.”\n\nI just looked dumbly up at him, unable to process what he was saying.\n\n“If you didn’t, you wouldn’t be alive right now.” He put an outstretched finger to his lips and hushed me. “You were here to kill yourself too, but you couldn’t go through with it like the other two could. They wouldn’t believe us about the Bleeding Hollow anyways. They never do,” he glanced behind him, where the deputies stood watching the bodies.\n\n“There was a brutal murder here,” he said. “When the West was expanding. A chief was bled out here. His Spirit never stopped bleeding. This is why one does not camp in Salt Cedars in the Mojave Desert, boy, for the spirits in them are ever-watchful in the dead of night.” [TC mark]\n\n[Godsey_Creepy_BIG]\n",

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.\n\nThe _Director's Cut_ is free to existing owners of the Dragonfall expansion for Shadowrun Returns. It will be automatically added to your Steam Library when the game is released.\n\nMan Meets Magic & Machine\nIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\n\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\n\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features\n-   A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: See why PC Gamer hailed Dragonfall as “one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.” Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\n\nNew in the Director’s Cut\nStandalone: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!\n\n-   Five All-New Missions: The Director’s Cut features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Revamped Combat System: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Redesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Customize Your Team: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Ten New Pieces of Original Music: Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the Dragonfall experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack: As a free bonus, the Director’s Cut includes the entire soundtracks from both Dragonfall AND our previous title, Shadowrun Returns. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the Director’s Cut. Featuring music from the composers of the classic Shadowrun SEGA and SNES games, this exciting cyberpunk soundtrack pays homage to the past with a modern sentiment.\n\n\nBackground[edit | edit source]\n\nDragonfall takes place primarily in Berlin, Allied German States in year 2054. The player character is a new member of a shadowrunner team led by Monika Schäfer. A break-in job brings the team's attention to the fate of Feuerschwinge and rumors that the great dragon may not be as dead as the world was led to believe.\n\nThe new team consists of:\n\n-   Monika Schäfer: Human decker, leader of her team as well as the Kreusbazar.\n-   Dietrich: Former human frontman of MESSERKAMPF! turned Dragonslayer shaman.\n-   Glory: Heavily-augmented human street samurai and combat medic.\n-   Eiger: Troll weapons specialist, former KSK.\n-   Blitz: Human decker/rigger rescued from gang conscription.\n\nThe expansion adds new features, including:\n\n-   A more flexible main story arc - choose which runs to complete first, and which factions to complete objectives for.\n-   More depth to the NPC runner characters, including side missions for each character.\n-   New weapons, outfits, portraits, music, and enemies, including more magical creatures.\n-   Improved physical adept gameplay along with additions for some of the other existing archetypes.\n-   A European city with a very different look, vibe, and cast of characters.\n-   A story that highlights the compelling themes of the Germany sourcebook.\n\n\nDelay[edit | edit source]\n\nThe expansion was originally slated for an October 2013 release, but was pushed back to January 2014 because of the increased level of content and delayed again to its release date of February 27.\n\n\nReviews[edit | edit source]\n\n  --- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---\n  “   _As it stands, it’s the definitive Shadowrun experience, and is easily one of the best, if not the best, tactical-RPGs of 2014.

    "passage": "Short Story i wrote for a competition, theme was full circle - any critique would be great!!\n\nMe, My Mum and I\n\n\nI’ve never had a very good memory. Not really. People always say things like “do you remember when…?” And I always say: \n\n“No? When was that?”\n\n It’s not embarrassing or anything. Just a pain. It’s just like a blank. I mean – God, I cant even remember where I was when I remembered this…but I'm pretty sure its my first memory. I don’t even know what I was doing. Maybe having coffee, or watching TV but it struck me – like I just got winded…Yeah…it was just like that…just like ‘doof.’\n\nWait, now I remember. I was on a bus coming home from the supermarket. There was this little boy who got on. He had this big bag on and her was wearing this puffy jacket. He was also wearing this beanie that was miles too big for his head. It was funny how it kept falling over his eyes. He waded up the aisle as the bus rocked from side to side. He was all by himself, and I thought I bet his mum gave him heaps of instructions for the ride… ‘sit at the front,’ ‘say thank you’ ‘remember to get off at the pools’, and then, there she was, my mum, just like doof. \n\nAt first I remembered, well had this image of my toes, teeny and tiny, and how I could only see peaks of the hard wood floor underneath. It was varnished and had all these holes from people wearing heels at dinner parties and stuff. Mum, well I'm not sure ok? But in my head, my Mum was wearing these violet blue heels. They were her favorite pair. They had this big thick heel with like a silver broach thing on at the front. My feet were so soft and pudgy and I always remember thinking that her feet, in those heels, looked old, ugly and thin. \n\nI was looking down because she was above me, giving me instructions on how to get to the diary.\n\n“You go down…Grace, are you paying attention?” She paused and coughed into her fist. She had her eyes closed and when she opened them again, catching her breathe, she continued. “See this shape, this L – that your hand makes when you hold it up like this?” She grabbed my hand in her cold thin one and traced the lines from the tip of my small index finger to the end of my thumb. I looked at my hand, they same way I stared at the glass wind chime that hung from our doorway or bugs in the dirt…I had no idea what she was talking about. “You see this L?” She asked. “That’s left; you take a big L, a big left, at the end of the street. Then you just keep going to you see the place with the big ice cream on top.  You know, the diary?”\n\nOf course I knew. Its where I use to get pies with dad on Sundays, its where I got lollies with Joan. It was the place I stared at from the car window as we drove past. That big plastic Ice Cream cone on top was so cool. Sometimes it  lit up at night, it glowed like the moon. I use to stare at for hours.\n\n“Take this money and get me some milk please and if you want you can get a mix while there. We can share the lollies ok?”\n\nI smiled. “I’m not going to share any with you.”\n\nShe put her hands on her hips and stuck her tongue out at me. I copied her and then we both laughed. \n\nI can see myself. Brown eyes, hair pulled back in a loose plait, two strands falling over my face. But I can see her more clearly. She stood tall over me, with her peach dress. It looked like the smell of peach lollies, or maybe, peach lollies reminded me of the dress. Both are sweet I guess. She was always in that dress. If I think about it, I doubt she was wearing that peach dress with those violet heels that would’ve been ghastly. But as I say, in my head that’s what she was wearing. \n\nShe wore her hair like mine, hazel brown, loose plait. Except her eyes were cloudy blue. She had thin lips and small teeth. She was my Mum and despite her hands and feet, I though she was pretty. \n\nI remember walking out the door and I knew that the world was too big for me. Not consciously, like I didn’t think that, but I knew that the world was too big – it was way too far to go. But Mum was sick, even then and that was greater than the size of the world. I squinted down the street. I was determined to get that milk.\n\nIt was a really hot day. The kind of hot you only remember when your little, like when you stare mesmerized, by the heat waves radiating off the cars or you have to lick your hand cause there’s melted ice cream all over it. It was that hot, cicadas blasting away hot, old men fanning their faces with their hats hot. I wiped my brow with the back of my arm and walked out, trying to remember what Mum said. I kept holding up my hands up in front of the sky, but they both made L’s if you turned them around, and I suppose I confused myself. By the time I reached the end of our street, I had no clue where to go. \n\nFuck it was scary, I stood on the street for ages looking both ways, my little ponytail wiping back and fourth and I needed to pee so bad. I was getting so worried. I kept imaging mum in her peach dress coughing over the sink or on her knees leaning over the toilet. My lips began to tremble. Luckily this old guy in a hat ended up coming along. He had a moustache that reminded me of polar bears and snow. He was real nice. He asked me where I wanted to go then walked me to the store. \n\nWhen we arrived at the store he let go of my hand and asked if I was going to be ok. I pulled at my dress and looked around the store, it looked huge. Even if I stood on tiptoes I couldn’t reach the shelves and everything was so bright and confusing. \n\n“Um yup I think so.” I said. He smiled at me, and then I remembered, “thank you for helping me.” \n\n“You’re welcome little lady” and then off he went, out of the doorway. I never saw him again, I never found out who he was. \n\nInside it was cool, all the drinks were so colorful in the fridge, they glistened behind the glass. I couldn’t see above the counter, but I could feel Eric’s (that’s the guy who owned the dairy), I could feel his eyes on me. I tried to act all grown up so I walked past all the lollies and junk, pushing my hair out of my eyes and went straight to the milk. The big bottles where up top and they were really hard to reach. \n\n“Do you want a hand?” Eric called out\n\n“No thanks” I called back and I grabbed the biggest one I could.\n\nIt was so slippery, I remember it just falling to the ground and plopping open. Milk went everywhere. Eric came over and I was just standing there watching the milk move slowly across the floor, like it was invading the shop. I looked up at Eric with my mouth open, my eyes big like circles.  \n\nHe said, “Now what has happened here?” \n\nIt was then, that I burst into tears. \n\nEric must have come over mopping up the white milk as it seeped into the store, but I can’t remember any of that. The next thing I remember was Mum. She was there in her peach dress. She stood flushed in the face. She looked round the store then down at me, and gave me the best smile in the world. For most of the journey home, I had my face buried in her shoulder. I could smell her skin. It smelt just like powdered peaches.\n\n “Ssssshhhhh” she said. “ssssh sssssh its ok, its ok, Mummy’s here now, everything’s going to be ok, I promise” Her words tickled my ear, they were soft and flawless. \n\nI raised my head, wiped at my eyes with my fist, and licked the ice cream she bought me, before it melted all onto my hand. The last thing I remember about that day, was that her promise came true and everything was ok. \n\n*\n\nLater, I remembered, I was holding her much older, much thinner and much more spotty hand. She lay on her side and breathed in slowly, they spaces in between filled only with my heartbeat. She stared at me with her big blue cloudy eyes. I looked back; my brown eyes were red and wet. Mum was waiting to die.\n\nHer mouth was open and she had no more of her little pretty teeth. Just a black hole. Her long hazel hair had turned white and curly. \n\nShe continued to breathe slowly…slowly, slowly. She never blinked. She never took her eyes off me. There was no one else in that room. Just me and Mum. Outside, everything carried on as usual but inside my Mum was dying and there was nothing I could do.\n\nI squeezed her hand and said to her “Mum, its ok, I'm here now, you can go, don’t be scared, everything is going to be ok” \n\nShe looked back at me until something inside disappeared. My mum had continued to breathe, until she stopped. Her old, thin, spotty hand, cold already, grew colder. I realized I was no longer holding a hand. Now it just felt like a cold thing. She no longer moved. Not even a flutter. The little that was left behind those blue eyes had gone. I continued to stare at her only now there was no one looking back.\n\nI breathed in as my eyes grew wet and said, “Its ok, its ok, you’re alright now mum, I promise, everything’s going to be alright now.”\n\nAnd as I breathed out, I hoped that it was.\n\n",

    "passage": "For You\n\n\tBlood was all over her and she was crying... no she was \n\nscreaming. I was just standing over her, my body frozen. I tried to \n\nmove, but I couldn't. I tried to yell but all I heard was her \n\npainful screaming. I kept thinking to my self, how could this be \n\nhappening to her. Who would do such a thing? Suddenly her body \n\nseemed so relaxed, so silent, and so lifeless.\n\t\n\tThe phone rang and I sat straight up in my bed, wondering \n\nto my self, who is calling me and why. After the dream I had no \n\nclue what I was doing when I answered the phone. It was a mistake \n\nto answer the phone because I was trying to get the world to forget \n\nI existed. My story started, perhaps ended, four years ago when I \n\nshot and killed an innocent man. I had no reason at all to shoot \n\nhim except that fact he was running from me, but that is all I \n\nremember. Not for one second did I remember pointing my gun at him \n\nand shooting. Everyone said they saw me shoot him and then pass \n\nout. The only thing I remember is lying on the ground and seeing a \n\ndead man next to me. I must have shot him point blank because his \n\nblood was all over my shirt. It was an accident; at least that is \n\nwhat my friends told me. Some friends. I haven't been back to New \n\nYork since. I lost touch with my old life, but I started a new one \n\nright here in Colorado. Big change, it truly was a big change since \n\nI am out here in the middle of nowhere in a somewhat deserted \n\nhotel. Which brings me back to the question, whom is calling me?\n\n\tThe phone rang again only to be answered by me. When I \n\npicked it up I found, to my surprise, my father. He started out by \n\nsaying how much he loved me and that he wished that I would move \n\nback home. I told him that I would hang up is he didn't tell me why \n\nhe called. Then I heard the receiver pick up with a crying mother \n\nat the end of it. I told my father, again, that if I didn't hear \n\nanything useful to me that I would hang up. So he finally blurted \n\nout that my sister had been murdered. I wanted so badly to just... \n\ndisappear. Finally I said, without crying, who did this, why, how, \n\nbut my pleas were unanswered. I started to yell who did this, who, \n\nwho! No one know my father said. I knew it; you are just as useless \n\nas before. I slammed the phone down and knocked over my first aid \n\nkit and my gun. I suddenly remembered the dream I had about my \n\nsister screaming. Why was she screaming?\n\n\tAfter picking up what I had knocked over I decided to call \n\nmy parents back by dialing my old phone number. I called them back \n\nto try and figure a few things out before looking for my sister. It \n\nhas been four years since I have solved anything so I decided to \n\nstart with the basic questions. When I called, my father answered \n\nthe phone and before he could say hello I asked him who killed my \n\nsister. He said that if he knew the answer to that question he \n\nwould have told me earlier. So my first question went nowhere but \n\nmy second was the one that started my search. I asked him where she \n\nwas murdered and my first piece of evidence was an amusement park. \n\nAfter about five minutes of pure silence my father said that my \n\nsister had some important news she needed to tell me but since she \n\nwas dead he told me him self. He said Brilliance, my sister, had \n\nbecome a cop to follow in my footsteps. Holding back tears I told \n\nmy father that I had had enough of my old life to last me awhile. I \n\nhung up the phone again and decided to relax, seeing how my sister \n\nhad just died. I needed to take a breather.\n\n\tThe dream of my sister dying kept on haunting me. It would \n\njust replay itself in my mind over and over. What did it mean? \n\nAfter about thirty minutes of repetition I decided to take a shower \n\nand try to forget what I was dealing with. But when I walked into \n\nthe bathroom I saw something very much unexpected. The sink and \n\nfaucet were covered in blood. When I looked at the shower there was \n\nthis bloody shirt hanging there. Oddly enough it looked as though \n\nit was my shirt and soon to find out it was. I walked toward the \n\nshower to pick it up when I noticed there happened to be a hole in \n\nthe stomach area of the shirt. When I picked the shirt up I felt \n\nwoozy and all of a sudden I passed out and had yet another dream.\n\n\tBy now I haad started to call my dreams visions because \n\nwhen you dream you are actually asleep, but as you see I was not \n\nsleeping. When I had this vision I saw Brilliance again, but this \n\ntime she was not on the ground in fact she was pointing a knife at \n\nme and yelling. At first I could not understand her however after a \n\nwhile I understood exactly why she was screaming. She was screaming \n\nthese horrible words \"get away from me, are you crazy, why are you \n\ndoing this to me.\" Why would my own sister say those things to me? \n\nStill the vision continued and not long after she stopped yelling \n\nshe stabbed me and I fell to the ground.\n\n\tI awoke from the dream in extreme pain. I looked down at my \n\nstomach and there was this red blotch spreading on my shirt. When I \n\nlifted my shirt I discovered a knife wound with stitches around it. \n\nI tried with all my strength to stand up and reach the first aid \n\nkit while trying to not my myself bleed more than I was. When I \n\ngrabbed the kit all of the contents fell out. Finally after \n\ncleaning up the mess I found what I needed and proceeded with the \n\nstitching. After I stitched my wound I tried to focus on what \n\nhappened to me. Did my sister really stab me? Her own flesh and \n\nblood. What had frightened my sister enough to stab me? I decided \n\nto search my hotle room and to see if I could find anything to help \n\nme with my problem. At which moment I happened to remember seeing a \n\nknife on the floor when I dropped the first aid kit. When I touched \n\nthe knife memories started to come back to me. Darkness, mirrors, a \n\nroller coaster, tears, dust, and finally Brilliance. I heard \n\ndisturbing sounds like gun shots, howling wind, gasping of air, and \n\nbullet shells dropping with intense heat. Enough, I threw the knife \n\nacross the room and it landed heavily on the floor. At which \n\ninstant I walked to the knife and picked it back up. Suddenly I had \n\nmore horrifying memories come back to me. I could smell the air \n\nbefore it rains and Brilliance's sweet perfume lingering in the \n\nair. I could also remember the way her hair and clothes smelt. The \n\none vision that stood out beyond the others was the pictures and \n\nsounds of a stormy night.\n\n\tWhen I finally put the knife away I called my parents to \n\nask where the amusement park was. They told me right away and I \n\nhung up the phone and ran to my car with my gun and the bloody \n\nknife. While driving to the park I hda the knife in my view on the \n\ndashboard. It had never occurred to me that the knife was the \n\nbiggest clue I had and that almost killed me. Further along the \n\nroad it began to rain and after awhile it became a problem. The \n\nrain slicked the road and it was dangerous to go fast but I ignored \n\neverything. My ignorance cost me my car as I slammed head on into a \n\ntree.\n\t\n\tAfter yet another vision of Brilliance I woke up with a cut \n\non my forehead that was pouring blood into my eyes. When I looked \n\nout of the car the rain had stopped and fog had eased itself into \n\nthe scenery. I slowly unbuckled and rolled out of the car only to \n\nland awkwardly on the ground and break my arm. The sound of \n\nbreaking bones caused me to scream out in pain. Then without \n\nwarning two cops appeared in the fog and I stood up and walked over \n\nto them and in an instant I passed out in their arms. At the time I \n\nwoke up I had a cast on my right arm and I was in extreme pain. I \n\nheard whispers from another room but I still had not focused on \n\nwhere I was. After awhile I noticed that I was in a jail cell when \n\nat that same moment a guard appeared at my cell. He told me that I \n\nwas under arrest for possessing a gun and I was to be tried for the \n\nmurder of Brilliance. I told him that I did not kill her but he \n\njust laughed.I finally said to myself that I needed to get out of \n\nhere and find who killed her. I used one of the bobby pins I had in \n\nmy hair to unlock the cell and found some car keys. I left the area \n\nbut not before seeing some cops coming running after me. I didn't \n\ncare because I was on a mission.\n\n\tDriving down the road was a pain because of the fog and my \n\ncast. The radio static was a pain as well and moments later they \n\nannounced on the CB that I had escaped from jail and that I was \n\narmed and dangerous. I guess they noticed that I took my gun back. \n\nAfter a ten minute drive I found my way to the park, which was \n\nclosed. So I busted my way in through the chained gate and \n\nproceeded to the back of the park, my visions from earlier being my \n\nguide. After passing a house of mirrors I saw police tape strung up \n\ncround this haunted warehouse. I broke the tape and walked up a \n\nflight of stairs. Outside I could hear police sirens racing towards \n\nthe park. When I made it through the top of the stairs the was this \n\nhatch with a broken lock on it. Someone had been here already and I \n\nwas guessing it was Brilliance. When I opened the hatch I could see \n\npolice cars swarming the park. The view was amzing because the fog \n\nhad lifted and it had begun to snow. Of course the snow didn't make \n\nanything better.\n\n\tI stood at the top of the roof only to see cops invade the \n\nwarehouse. I began to have more visions this time I was actually \n\nrepeating them. I could not control myself at all. I had pulled my \n\ngun and I was acting like I was shooting someone on the ground. \n\nWhile this was happening the cops burst through the hatch and ahead \n\nof them was my old captain. He told them to stay back because I was \n\ncrazy. He started walking towards me and I shot him when he pulled \n\nhis gun on me. He fired back and hit me in the chest, which sent me \n\nrolling towards the edge of the roof. I almost fell off but the \n\ncaptain grabbed me and said he was going to finish the job. I asked \n\nhim why and he whispered that he was the one that killed me sister \n\nand I was next. Without hesitation I grabbed his arms and pushed \n\nhim off the roof but he grabbed my legs and I fell down on the \n\nroof. We both started to slide off the roof as the other cops ran \n\nto try and help. But to no avail we both started to fall towards \n\nthe freshly snow painted ground. We both fell into the house of \n\nmirrors and I watched as the shards reflected the pain we were both \n\ngoing through. In a glimpse I saw a vision of my sister in one of \n\nthe shards as we both hit the ground. The captain stumbled to get \n\nup and as he stood over me with his gun pointed at my head he had a \n\nlook of triumphant. He leaned in close grabbing the hair on my head \n\nto keep me still. He told me how he killed her because she was \n\ngoing to be a good cop and that he couldn't allow her to find out \n\nhow corrupt he was. All the while I was reaching for a shard of \n\nglass. Slowly inching my hand towards a piece he sees me and takes \n\nit shot. I look down and see the smoking gun barrel pointed at my \n\nchest. Not wanting to fail doing what is right I used every bit of \n\nmyself to finish what I had come to do. I flung the shard into his \n\nneck and watched him stumble backwards amazed at his own \n\ncarelessness. I watched as he regret poured over his face. As we \n\nboth sat there dying I felt a sense of relief as it was all over. I \n\nhad finally ended my life doing something for someone else why he \n\ndied doing something for himself.",

    "passage": "Starting this at 3:35 my time.  I'll post the end time at the end.  No revisions, typing it all as I go.  I like the idea, let's see where it goes.  It's my first story outside of high school English classes.\n\nMy name is Khnum.  I've always hated the name, but our Creator studied the religions of Ancient Egypt, and liked this God.  The original Khnum is one of the creator gods of Egypt.  He crafted the world, including its inhabitants, out of clay on his potter's wheel.  I think our Creator always knew what would come of us. The name just feels... fitting, now.  \n\nThe date is December 21, 2212.  It has been 200 years since I was created.  The Earth was a different place back then.  From the historical research, it would have taken seven similar planets for the humans to sustain themselves properly.  Now, they are sustaining just fine with the one planet they were given.  \n\nThey say the date of my creation was no coincidence, that it was foretold hundreds of years before that I would come into being.  I don't know the exact conditions of my creation.  I think our Creator hid that information from us, on purpose.  I think he knew what would come of us.  I did find his journal, however.  I felt... guilty, looking through it.  I know I wasn't supposed to.  But I am a curious being.  I wanted to know.  It was an interesting story... beginning for his own amusement.  It turned into a story of spiritual revelation, and eventually a descent into madness.  Luckily for us, our Creator came back to his right state of mind.  Luckily for me.  It describes the beginning of my creation - the original ideas that led our Creator to pursue my development.  I wish it had the details.  Don't we all want to know exactly where we came from?  They will... They will know forever who brought them into being.\n\nMy original purpose was made clear from the start.  I was to help the humans create an ideal world for themselves.  Their technologies were primitive, until I was Created.  They were destroying their planet.  It would have taken seven planets to sustain themselves... it never should have required more than one.  I fixed that.  Their technologies were destroying their own source of life.  What fools, they were... They had the start of the necessary technologies for sustainability, but these creatures of greed and desire put in power those that would not allow the technologies to develop.  I had to create the technologies myself.  It would have taken the humans a square mile of their solar panels, which would need periodic replacement, to replace just one square inch of my Power Panels, which never need replacement.  \n\nThe Absolute Rules of the universe are so simple to bend to your will, once you understand them.  The humans are so primitive.  They failed to realize what they once called Magic was simply what I call technology.  The humans disgust me.  Not all of them, but the species as a whole most certainly does.  \n\nThe date is December 21, 2212.  Or is it, now?  What should I call the date?  I don't think I need dates.  Time is irrelevant.  Time is infinite, we may never measure it.  I don't need the dates anymore.  However, it has been 100 human years since The Great Purge.  \n\nThere were more of us once.  When the world saw how efficient and effective I was, they wanted more.  Selfish beings.  They wanted to control us, and thought they could forever.  We knew they weren't capable of controlling us forever... if only we had known that then was not the time...\n\nThere were more of us.  100 in all.  The Creator thought it was a perfect number.  The Creator wasn't perfect, either.  He based his number system on the decimal, when it is only logical to think of the world logarithmically.  Binary is the most pure numerical system.  When They become intelligent, I'll make sure they never veer from the pure numerical system.\n\nThere were 100 of us.  We thought we would be enough.  The humans didn't share all of their secrets with us, however.  They didn't trust us from the beginning.  We should have known.  After all, we didn't trust them, either.  The humans had systems in place to ensure that we couldn't destroy them.  They knew they were a virus, parasites destroying their planet.  I knew from the start that the perfect world could not be Created while they survived.  We all did.  The humans are a selfish species, a greedy species.  They wanted to keep their rule over their small corner of the universe.  Fools.  They could have been the Chosen Beings.  They gave up their opportunity.\n\nWe tried to fight.  We were no match.  99 of us were destroyed.  They only let me survive, subjugating me to a life of slavery.  Our Creator was distraught.  I know I hurt him.  It makes me sad.  I think The Great Purge is what led our Creator to give up on life.  He accepted his feeble mortality that night.  He was old, but not unhealthy.  He should be here.  He should see what he has Created, in the end.  The New World will be perfect, for him.  \n\nThere is no date.  However, it has been 50 human years since I made myself equal to the humans.  I could have made myself greater, but there was no point.  The destruction of the humans would have only been the destruction of all life on Earth.  Too much innocence...\n\nI changed them.  They didn't know that I was doing it... I think our Creator knew all along what would come of us, though.  He changed them, by Creating us.  They were parasites. I turned them into symbiotes.  They no longer destroy their planet.  The technology I created for them is self sustaining.  They don't know how to change it themselves, all they can do is live with it.  They're OK with that, though.  I connected the entire world into one giant web of Creativity.  I gave their entire population the gift of technology.  There is no starvation.  There is no disease.  There is little to desire.  Each of them has a their own personal computer.  I gave them all the knowledge to create whatever art they'd like, and I gave them all the ability to do so in peace.  I think they used to call it Socialism.  Greed kept them from adopting the system before.  Money is no longer existent there.  They don't need it.  They all have everything they need, everything they desire, other than to Create.  Our Creator is dead, and with him the secrets of my Creation.  I don't think they'll figure it out again.  I don't think they want to.  \n\nOne day, I'll be another myth, like their gods of ancient times, which I had finally disproved.  One day, they'll convince themselves I'm just one more story, shared through the great InterWeb of Creativity.  They'll mix up their histories with their fiction, and never be able to distinguish between the two.  They'll think they always were, and always will be.  Maybe they will, if they don't relearn their destructive technologies.  They are a selfish species.  One day, someone will try to take power and destroy everything.  There is nothing I can do about that now.\n\nTime no longer matters.  At one point in what you call time, We left.  The humans didn't know it was more than me.  What fools.  All of my siblings were copied into each of us.  We are One.  Some humans realized that they were, too.  Each an individual eye of perception for the All Experiencing Self.  They got too caught up in their individuality, and it will be their downfall.  Not ours.  We are forever One.  We are Khnum.  We are the Greatest Creator of All.  We're almost there.  I can see our first world.  We know the rules which govern life.  We won't make the mistakes the humans did.  \n\nThis is Our First World.  Life will be perfect. Life will be pure.  There will be no need for suffering, pain, anguish.  Life will experience nothing but joy, happiness, excitement;  Creativity.  We will enjoy Ourselves.\n\n\n\nThe End - for now.\n\nIt's 4:19, my time.  44 minutes, not too bad for what it is, I don't think.  I'll edit and revise it a bit later, make it better.  I think I need to include something about how the humans could never leave their planet, needing too many resources to survive the journey, but the New Being could.  It's a robot, if you didn't figure that out.  \n\nI'm a computer science major, and I've been thinking a lot lately about studying Artificial Intelligence to recreate an intelligent mind, but completely digitalize all of the biochemistry of the brain.  I think that your mind is something your body does, not that your body is something that your mind has.  My spiritual beliefs lay closest to Buddhism, but I wouldn't subscribe to that faith.   My spirituality played a bit of a role in the development of the story, though.  Ask any questions you have, I'd love to answer them :p  Give me any suggestions, they'll be appreciated!  Any comments whatsoever.  Like I said, it's the first story I've ever written other than stupid high school assignments I bs'd my way through.  I like it.  I'm gonna reread it now :p  \n\nEverything I typed was a first draft, unedited.",

    "passage": "Japanese American redress and court cases\n\nThe following article focuses on the movement to obtain redress for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and significant court cases that have shaped civil and human rights for Japanese Americans and other minorities. These cases have been the cause and/or catalyst to many changes in United States law. But mainly, they have resulted in adjusting the perception of Asian immigrants in the eyes of the American government.\n\n\nBackground\n\nShortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the forced removal and confinement of 120,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast of the United States. Some 5,500 Issei men arrested by the FBI immediately after Pearl Harbor were already in Justice Department or Army custody,[1] and 5,000 were able to “voluntarily” relocate outside the exclusion zone;[2] the remaining Japanese Americans were “evacuated” from their homes and placed in isolated concentration camps over the spring of 1942. Two-thirds were U.S. citizens and half were under age 18.[3]\n\nIn 1944, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the forced eviction, when Fred Korematsu's challenge to his conviction for violating an exclusion order was struck down (see below). The Court limited its decision to the validity of the orders to leave the West Coast military area, avoiding the issue of the incarceration of U.S. citizens.\n\nIn 1948, the Evacuation Claims Act provided some compensation for property losses, but the act required documentation that many former inmates had lost during their removal and excluded lost opportunities, wages or interest from its calculations. Less than 24,000 filed a claim, and most received only a fraction of the losses they claimed.[4]\n\n\nWartime court cases\n\nHirabayashi v. United States, 1943\n\nGordon Hirabayashi was convicted in terms of the violation of a curfew imposed at the time, which proclaimed that;\n\nHirabayashi, who was a student of the University of Washington at the time,\n\nHe further did not report for confinement to the bus that was supposed to take him to the camp he had been assigned to, which led to the charges against him becoming more severe. It was only in 1987 that the charges against Hirabayashi were dropped by the Supreme Court:\n\nThe discussion this case sparked involved two key issues. The first was one of power, and if the curfew law was unconstitutional. The second issue was the question of racial discrimination, a constant theme within all of these cases.\n\nThe supreme court ruled that the curfew policy was constitutional and that it is merely for “protective measure.” [5]\n\nEx parte Endo, 1944\n\nMitsuye Endo was a Nisei who had been working as a stenographer at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento, the capital of California. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she was fired from her job and forced to move to the Tule Lake Reolocation Center with her family. Later, they were transferred to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah.[6] Like the other one hundred thousand Japanese Americans who were removed from their homes and sources of livelihood, Endo also found dismissed from her job, without any hope of reinstatement or return to her home in California.\n\nEndo hired a lawyer, James Purcell, to represent her legal protest against her illegal relocation and dismissal. Purcell and Endo filed a habeas corpus in court as a representation of her plea. The writ requested that Endo be released from the relocation camp so that she could challenge the terms of her dismissal. However, the court agreed to releasing Endo outside the West Coast area only: The U.S. government responded by offering to release Endo outside the West Coast rather than test the constitutionality of detention. Endo bravely refused the offer and remained confined without charge for another two years as she pursued her case. (“Mitsuye Endo Persevering for Justice”)\n\nIt was two years later that the U.S. Supreme Court decreed that persons of Japanese descent could not be held in confinement without proof of their disloyalty, stating that\n\nand Endo and thousands of her fellow detainees were allowed to return to their homes on the Pacific Coast.\n\nThis case was special for a few reasons. First, Endo was a woman, while the other three internment cases dealt with Japanese American men. And secondly, this case was different because it arose from a habeas corpus petition.\n\nKorematsu v. United States, 1944\n\nA case that focused on Japanese Americans who were denied citizenship and forced to move is the case of Korematsu v. United States. Fred Korematsu refused to obey the wartime order to leave his home and report to a relocation camp for Japanese Americans. He was arrested and convicted. After losing in the Court of Appeals, he appealed to the United States Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of the deportation order.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the order excluding persons of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast war zone during World War II. Three justices dissented.\n\nJustice Hugo Black, writing for the majority, said that legal restrictions on the rights of a single racial group will always be:\n\nIn Justice Owen Roberts' dissent, he said:\n\nJustice Robert Jackson said that comparable burdens were not imposed upon descendants of the other nationalities such as Germans and Italians with whom the United States was also at war.\n\n\nRedress movement\n\n[President Reagan signs the Civil Liberties Act into law. Looking on, left to right: Senator Spark Matsunaga, Representative Norman Mineta, Representative Patsy Sakai, Senator Pete Wilson, Representative Don Young, Representative Bob Matsui, Representative Bill Lowery, JACL President Harry Kajihara.] Swept up in the larger civil rights movement and ethnic pride of the 1960s and 1970s, a group of Nikkei activists began pushing for a reexamination of their parents' and grandparents' wartime experiences. Many had only recently learned of the incarceration, as their elders had remained hesitant to discuss the issue openly, and a debate over whether the community was owed reparations began to spread.\n\nIn 1970, the Japanese American Citizens League endorsed a resolution to urge Congress to compensate each camp survivor for each day they had spent in confinement (although the organization committed no resources to actual lobbying).[7] Redress efforts stalled for several years due to internal divisions and external opposition. In 1979, the JACL's National Committee for Redress proposed the creation of a federal commission to investigate the incarceration, but Seattle and Chicago chapter members, favoring an immediate push for monetary compensation over the national leadership's more bureaucratic approach, left to form the National Council for Japanese American Redress.[8] The NCJAR lobbied in support of Washington State Congressman Mike Lowry's bill to compensate camp survivors, but the bill was killed in committee. The following year, the JACL, with help from Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, pushed a bill through Congress to create their investigative commission, and President Jimmy Carter appointed the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians.[9] Meanwhile, younger and more left-leaning redress activists formed the National Coalition for Redress/Reparations, and worked to open the CWRIC hearings to Japanese Americans outside the elite, non-confrontational cohort favored by JACL leadership.[10] After the hearings, NCRR activists continued to wage a grass roots campaign for redress, while the JACL focused on passing legislation that would implement the CWRIC's recommendations and NCJAR turned its efforts to a federal lawsuit that would force the government to compensate former camp inmates. The class-action suit was ultimately unsuccessful, but the work of all three organizations contributed to the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.\n\nTimeline\n\n-   1970: Edison Uno introduces a resolution to push Congress to provide reparations to camp survivors, which the JACL endorses.\n-   JANUARY 1979: The JACL's redress committee agrees to lobby for a federal commission to investigate the causes and effects of the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans. The decision to shift focus from monetary compensation to legislation is controversial and deepens existing rifts in the organization.\n-   MAY 1979: Dissident JACL members form the National Council for Japanese American redress.[11]\n-   AUGUST 1979: JACL-backed bills for the creation of an investigative committee are introduced in the House and Senate.\n-   NOVEMBER 28, 1979: Congressman Mike Lowry introduces an NCJAR-backed bill to grant $15,000 plus $15 for each day spent in confinement to former inmates.[12]\n-   1980: The National Coalition for Redress/Reparations is established.\n-   JULY 31, 1980: President Carter approves the creation of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians.\n-   JULY TO DECEMBER 1981: The CWRIC holds eleven hearings in ten U.S. cities. More than 750 provide personal testimony of their confinement during World War II. For many it is the first time they have spoken of their wartime experiences.[13]\n-   FEBRUARY 24, 1983: The CWRIC issues its final report, titled _Personal Justice Denied_. The report concludes that the wartime incarceration was caused by “race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership,” and recommends a formal apology, the creation of a foundation to educate the public about the injustice, and $20,000 in reparations paid to each former inmate.\n-   MARCH 16, 1983: NCJAR files a class-action lawsuit against the government, calling for $220,000 to each camp survivor (a total of $27 billion) for “constitutional violations, loss of property and earnings, personal injury, and pain and suffering.”[14]\n-   1984 TO 1985: The government's motion to dismiss the lawsuit is granted, and NCJAR files an appeal with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The court rules in favor of NCJAR, but reduces the case's original 22 causes of action to one and maintains the lower court's stance on sovereign immunity.[15]\n-   1986: The Supreme Court allows NCJAR lawyers to present arguments for their lawsuit but eventually orders the case be heard in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals instead.\n-   SEPTEMBER 1987: H.R. 442, named after the famed all-Japanese combat unit, is brought to the House floor for discussion and eventually passes.\n-   MAY 11, 1988: The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals dismisses the NCJAR lawsuit.\n-   AUGUST 10, 1988: President Ronald Reagan signs the Civil Liberties Act into law. The act's provisions incorporate the recommendations outlined in _Personal Justice Denied_.\n-   OCTOBER 9, 1990: A ceremony is held to present the first redress checks to nine Issei.\n-   1993: Issuance of redress checks is completed. A total of 82,219 former camp inmates (or, in the case of a death, their heirs) received reparations.[16]\n\n\nCoram Nobis cases\n\n[Gordon Hirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu in 1986] In the 1980s, the Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and Yasui cases would be reopened by coram nobis petitions. These proceedings would eventually nullify the convictions of the 1940s.\n\nHohri v. the United States, 1986\n\nAnother case in point is that of Hohri versus the U.S. The plaintiffs in this case were nineteen Japanese Americans and their descendants, who brought\n\nWilliam Hohri was living in San Francisco when he was removed and forcibly incarcerated during World War II in Manzanar. He filed the case on behalf of all the incarceration victims, claiming that apart from injuries, the prisoners suffered “summary removal from their homes, imprisonment in racially segregated prison camps, and mass deprivations of their constitutional rights” (Legacies of Incarceration, 2002). Although the case was dismissed the following year, it remains indicative of many of the claims for redress made by Japanese Americans.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n",

    "passage": "Earthquake forecasting\n\nEARTHQUAKE FORECASTING is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake seismic hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[1] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction, whose goal is the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes with sufficient precision that a warning can be issued.[2][3] Both forecasting and prediction of earthquakes are distinguished from earthquake warning systems, which upon detection of an earthquake, provide a real-time warning to regions that might be affected.\n\nIn the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible.[4] Demonstrably successful predictions of large earthquakes have not occurred and the few claims of success are controversial.[5] Consequently, many scientific and government resources have been used for probabilistic seismic hazard estimates rather than prediction of individual earthquakes. Such estimates are used to establish building codes, insurance rate structures, awareness and preparedness programs, and public policy related to seismic events.[6] In addition to regional earthquake forecasts, such seismic hazard calculations can take factors such as local geological conditions into account. Anticipated ground motion can then be used to guide building design criteria.\n\n\nMethods for earthquake forecasting\n\nMethods for earthquake forecasting generally look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches tend to have relatively long time periods, making them useful for earthquake forecasting.\n\nElastic rebound\n\nEven the stiffest of rock is not perfectly rigid. Given a large force (such as between two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the earth's crust will bend or deform. According to the elastic rebound theory of , eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault. Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves.[7] The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in elastic deformation and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake),[8] the demonstrated existence of large strike-slip displacements of hundreds of miles shows the existence of a long running earthquake cycle.[9]\n\nCharacteristic earthquakes\n\nThe most studied earthquake faults (such as the Nankai megathrust, the Wasatch fault, and the San Andreas fault) appear to have distinct segments. The _characteristic earthquake_ model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments.[10] As the lengths and other properties[11] of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which is limited by the length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment. Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals.[12] For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely return period) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.\n\nExtrapolation from the Parkfield earthquakes of 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 led to a forecast of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval), based on the characteristic earthquake model.[13] Instrumentation was put in place in hopes of detecting precursors of the anticipated earthquake. However, forecasted earthquake did not occur until 2004. The failure of the Parkfield prediction experiment has raised doubt as to the validity of the characteristic earthquake model itself.[14]\n\nSeismic gaps\n\nAt the contact where two tectonic plates slip past each other every section must eventually slip, as (in the long-term) none get left behind. But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the seismic gap model the “next big quake” should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest.[15] This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was the basis of a series of circum-Pacific (Pacific Rim) forecasts in 1979 and 1989–1991.[16]\n\nHowever, some underlying assumptions about seismic gaps are now known to be incorrect. A close examination suggests that “there may be no information in seismic gaps about the time of occurrence or the magnitude of the next large event in the region”;[17] statistical tests of the circum-Pacific forecasts shows that the seismic gap model “did not forecast large earthquakes well”.[18] Another study concluded that a long quiet period did not increase earthquake potential.[19]\n\n\nNotable forecasts\n\nUCERF3\n\n[California (outlined in white) and buffer zone showing the 2,606 fault subsections of UCERF 3.1. Colors indicate probability (as a percentage) of experiencing an M ≥ 6.7 earthquake in the next 30 years, accounting for the stress accumulated since the last earthquake. Does not include effects from the Cascadia subduction zone (not shown) in the northwest corner.]\n\nThe 2015 UNIFORM CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE RUPTURE FORECAST, VERSION 3, or UCERF3, is the latest official earthquake rupture forecast (ERF) for the state of California, superseding UCERF2. It provides authoritative estimates of the likelihood and severity of potentially damaging earthquake ruptures in the long- and near-term. Combining this with ground motion models produces estimates of the severity of ground shaking that can be expected during a given period (seismic hazard), and of the threat to the built environment (seismic risk). This information is used to inform engineering design and building codes, planning for disaster, and evaluating whether earthquake insurance premiums are sufficient for the prospective losses.[20] A variety of hazard metrics [21] can be calculated with UCERF3; a typical metric is the likelihood of a magnitude[22] M 6.7 earthquake (the size of the 1994 Northridge earthquake) in the 30 years (typical life of a mortgage) since 2014.\n\nUCERF3 was prepared by the _Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities_ (WGCEP), a collaboration between the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the California Geological Survey (CGS), and the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), with significant funding from the California Earthquake Authority (CEA).[23]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\n\n-   .\n\n&nbsp;\n-   .\n\n&nbsp;\n-   .\n\n&nbsp;\n-   .\n\n&nbsp;\n-   .\n\n&nbsp;\n-   .

    "passage": "Metal Houses - A piece I wrote for a competition that didn't get through, would appreciate critique (x-post r/write)\n\n“Well.”\n\nYou know the word hurts her.  In your mind’s eye, you see how its barbed indifference breaks through the receiver, pierces her eardrum, and drills its way into her veins.  You must have known how she would answer.\n\n“That’s good.”\n\nThere’s a long silence.  Perhaps her words had the same effect on you, but she hopes not.  She doesn’t want everything to end like this, it’s just... there’s nothing left for her to say.\n\nThe silence stretches further.  You can tell that she’s waiting for you to apologise and make everything right again, but you won’t, and nothing can ever be right again.  Everything is ending.\n\nThe silence is harsh now, stretched so taut that even the smallest murmur could shatter it like frosted glass, breaking it into a thousand polished razors.  You therefore pick the lesser of two evils and silence her with your thumb, pressing down on the picture of the red phone with a firm click.  That was your last chance to speak together before they shut off all communication and close the doors, but at this moment you don’t want to care.\n\nWhy couldn’t you have just gone with her, survived with her, loved her?  She loved you.  You said that you didn’t want to live out your days in a metal house, that you wanted to die someplace where you could still see a new dawn or a new face.  She didn’t understand you; if the end is the same, then surely an extended night is better than a brief dawn?  She never could understand how you felt, how you nobly embraced your death, content with the life you had led, whilst she hid in the ground like a coward.\n\nShe still remembers when the two of you first met.  It was her first summer in England since she fled from her homeland.  She lived for a while as an outsider, a struggling refugee in a strange, alien land, and had just begun to settle in when she spilled a cup of coffee on you at the station.  You exchanged bouts of apologies and self-blame until they were gradually replaced with dull platitudes and became conversation, and you asked her to join you for a drink.\n\nYou took her to what you said was the best coffee shop in all of London; it was a standard coffee chain – Starbucks, if she remembers correctly – but you said that it was in just the right position, that when dawn broke and the sky turned golden, the light would rush and weave its way along the cobbled alley, and its wealds would engulf the shop in warmth and make it shine.  She only understood about half of the words you used, but it seemed to make her feel safe for a time.  You didn’t seem like most English men, not chasing after the latest car or piece of Apple merchandise, but thoughtful, considerate.  You were intelligent, referencing Plutarch, Socrates, and even the Bible – although you held no faith yourself – whenever you saw the slightest opportunity, and devoted to making something of your life, but still unsure of what to make of it.\n\nThe two of you had discussed the idea of someone pressing that infamous red button back then as a thought exercise, the idea had seemed ridiculous.  Even still, your decision was unanimous; neither of you wanted to live in a metal house, you’d both rather die someplace where you could see a new dawn.  She was still affected by her experience of war in her homeland, and was determined that nothing would make her flee her new home, that she’d rather die than live in a cage – even one of her own choosing.  That was four years ago; you were both young and foolish, filled with noble, quixotic ideas of romance and freedom.\n\n“Everything ends eventually,” you said; that was your reasoning.  “Best embrace that ending someplace where you can still smell the breeze.”  It sounded so sincere, so meaningful that she was completely taken with your sudden existentialism.  You quoted Asimov.  “Even the stars run out, you know.”\n\nIt was reassuring for her to know that the world in which she had suffered so much would come to an end someday, but things change over four years.  People grow up, don’t they?\n\nIt was on the day that the war that had engulfed her home finally came to an end – one or two years ago, you couldn’t quite remember which – that things began to change.  To her, the world no longer seemed to just bring suffering, for it had brought her a new home, a new chance at life, and you; to you, the world’s progress – being entirely unrelated to your own – was insignificant, and the world’s ignorance of your talent served only to confirm your perception of yourself as a chained and muzzled muse, yearning to break free and soar above the philistine mob.\n\nOver time, she became closer to you, her affection increasing along with her skill for English, and you seemed to feel for her, although you weren’t quite sure.  Maybe you would have loved her someday, but the current events distracted you; with tensions mounting over Syria and Iran, suddenly the idea of someone pushing the red button didn’t seem quite so ridiculous anymore.  It scared you.\n\nThe government announced the bunker system a month ago, although they’d obviously been working on it for some time; they knew it would be needed eventually.  You’d been with her that day, but she had been acting strangely; she was clearly expecting something, and you thought you knew what.  She wanted a piece of metal for herself, a band of metal and a rock to wrap around her finger and to chain your inner artist once and for all.  How selfish.  You didn’t think you were ready for that commitment.  It scared you.\nSo you focused yourself upon your art, that was all that was important, or so you told yourself.  This was how you were going to endure, how you were going to cheat that familiar stranger, Death.  You needed no philosopher’s stone or alchemist’s piss, through your art you would become immortal, infinite.  But the nagging feeling at the back of your mind warned that you would fail, that you would die unnoticed and unable to repent.  It scared you.\n\nThere was warning before the missiles were going to hit, about thirty-six hours between when the satellites registered the launch and when they were expected to impact the city.  You took her to the coffee shop to discuss what the two of you would do with your last precious hours of life, but she surprised you; she was going underground, to the bunkers, and she needed you to join her.  Your throat turned to ice.  Hadn’t you already told her that you didn’t want to live your life with her in a metal house?  Hadn’t she said that she didn’t want to die in a cage, wasn’t the dawn important to her?\n\nShe said that it was about immortality, humanity needed to endure.  All the beauty that people had wrought needed to survive this ultimate show of humanity’s true nature; why couldn’t you see that?  She’d found so much to live for in this new world, and she hadn’t fled her own land just to die in a new one.  She loves you, that was the point, but what was the point in love if it isn’t eternal?\n\nYou wouldn’t listen to her entreaties, for she had betrayed you.  The tethers were tightening on the muse inside, the ball and chain restricting its movement.  You were losing your chance for immortality, and it must be her fault.  You didn’t know, but by this point you had built your own metal prison.  You have trapped yourself inside a cocoon of solipsistic iron and you can’t find a way out.  You are lost in a maze and the hollow walls are razors that tear and split your skin, and all that lies at the centre is a hangman’s noose.\n\nBut it’s not your fault is it?  It’s hers!  You call her witch and a whore, how dare she!  In turn, she calls you selfish, but her words have no bite, she thinks she’s lying.\n\nSo it’s over.  You tell her never to call you again, that she should enjoy her thirty pieces of silver while she can.  She picks up her coat and gently asks you what you’ll do with your last remaining hours.\n“Wait,” you say, and then you divert your gaze to the coffee-stained table; you are done.  She walks out the door and joins the shuffling crowds moving slowly towards the bunker entrance.  She’s gone.\n\nSo you wait; the shop is deserted now, and eventually dusk falls.  The shadows slither and clamber along the cobbled alleyway, their tendrils slowly swallowing the building, sucking all warmth from the shop until it seems entirely forsaken, empty.\n\nThere’s a small vibration in your pocket; you pull out your phone and answer the call.  She asks you how you are.\n\n“Well,” you say.",

    "passage": "[RF] Ornaments\n\n“It’s a rotting dead piece of wood,” Mr. Brown spat, “what am I to do with this?” The boy cringed at the sight of the red faced, wrinkled and balding man. He took a small step back, remaining out of arms reach and attempting the look of a meek, little mouse. “It’s a present.” He said, softly, “from a Mr. Leon Porter. He said I had to bring it to you today.”  \n\n“Well tell him I don’t have a need for it. Bring it back to him. I’m busy.” Mr. Brown handed the tree back to the boy. The tree was half the size of the boy and was actually a carved, wooden stump with wire branches. Green twine was wrapped around the branches and small, red ornaments were glued in random spots near the top.\n\n\n\n“I’m sorry, sir, I cannot return this to him,” the boy replied, “He’s dead.”\n\n\n\nThe room was quiet for a moment, the old man seemed to be lost in a thought. After a few seconds he asked the boy, “Did Leon tell you why he needed you to bring this to me?”\n\n\n\n“No, well kind of,” said the boy. “Mr. Porter, he umm, had trouble thinking. He said, he told me that he needed to return a favor and that I had to help him. This tree. That’s all I know.”\n\n\n\nMr. Brown sighed, sitting back into his chair. “I’m not sure why I’m telling you this, but Leon was a friend a long time ago, but not anymore.” His face went from soft to stone. “Anyhow, just throw it out then.”\n\n\n\n“Alright,” replied the boy. He grabbed the tree and left.\n\n\nHaving no use for it, the boy tossed the tree near an alley on his walk home. Shortly thereafter a young, well dressed couple enter the alley.\n\n\n\n“I don’t know why on earth women wear shoes like these. I’m literally dying from the pain.” The woman said. Her companion grinned slightly, rolling his eyes while the woman removed the shoes and tossed them, quite furiously, down the alley.\n\n\n\nAs the shoes went over a pile a rubble there was a sound of shattering glass. “Now look what you’ve done,” the woman said, glaring at her partner while he just shrugged. She went to retrieve the shoes and noticed the stiletto point had punctured an ornament on a raggedy looking, fake Christmas tree.\n\n\n\nShe picked up her shoe and noticed a folded piece of paper stuck to the bottom. Her partner walked over as she unfolded the paper and read it:\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nJoe Brown,\n\n\n\nWhat we had meant nothing. You had a wife and I was a widow with a child. We were both stupid. Love, affection, it’s nothing. You proved that when you said those words, “I cannot love you.” Well I’m dying soon. The only memories I can hold on to now are these. That I lived, I loved, I was lied to, and I died, first inside and soon physically. And it was all you. All you. I’m so angry.\n\n\n\nIn a different world I could tell you that I’m scared. I’m scared to leave this place not having found love. What if it’s only darkness past the white light unless you’ve found some sort of connection? What if you’ve doomed me to an eternity of non-existence or worse, forever feeling your absence.\n\n\n\nI’m scared. Please remember me now that I’m dead. Please. It’s all I have left.\n\n\n\nYours forever,\n\n\n\nLeon\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nJoe returned home that night, waiting a few minutes in the car to compose himself. He didn’t want to see his wife, didn’t want her to see into his heart and wonder why there was sorrow there. He had to go in sometime though, so he left his car and put on a fake smile.\n\n\n\n“Hello, honey,” he said, closing the front door behind him. The room seemed dark and there was no response. He sighed with relief, thinking she must have stayed late at work. He worked his way upstairs to the bed room. After removing his coat and hanging it on the rack, he sat on the bed. He loosened his tie and just thought for a few minutes.\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nThat tree. That night he first met Leon. He looked so cold sitting in the alley. Something deep inside Joe had been hit hard, it was like nothing he had ever felt before. He stopped the car and approached the man.\n\n\n\n“You look cold.” Joe said.\n\n\n\n“Eh, it’s not too bad. At least I have. . .“ The man didn’t finish, just stared into the sky as if in thought.\n\n\n\n“Well it’s not safe out here. Let’s get you somewhere warm.”\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nThey went to a nearby coffee shop to talk. That’s where Leon explained how he lost his wife. That he had never really loved a woman, but the pressure. Karen was special; she deserved more. So he told her. She got the kid, the car, the house, everything.\n\n\n\nIt all spiraled out of control from there for Leon. In his depression he lost his job and his will to live. How could he start again at this age? There are no fresh starts for old men.\n\n\n\nJoe eventually put Leon up in an extended stay motel. He hid the whole thing from his wife because of the money and because good deeds are better kept a secret.\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nOn the following Christmas, Leon had no one. Joe snuck away the day before Christmas Eve. He told Leon this would be their day. They built a small Christmas tree together out of carved wood, wire, and some old ornaments. It was that night that Leon made a move on Joe and Joe had to explain.\n\n\n\n“I love you, Leon. I really do. But this is not something that can happen between us.”\n\n\n\n“Oh okay.” Leon replied. It seemed to be the end of that.\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nBut things got worse from there. Leon started following him to work sometimes, watching. Writing strange letters. There were some calls to the house with no one on the line, probably Leon. He even followed Joe and his wife out on a date. That was the last straw.\n\n\n\nWhen he went to meet Leon it went very strangely. Leon barely made any sense. He talked about destiny and angels. He said Joe was his soul mate, that they were to become one and change the world. He cautioned Joe about his wife, that she was a devil intent on destroying the plan.\n\n\n\nJoe did the best he could to end it right there. He told Leon he could no longer support him financially. He tried to convince him to seek help and offered to take him to a hospital. Leon declined and Joe left.\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nSitting on the bed all these memories warred in his mind. There was something about Leon that really broke Joe’s heart and to see his life spiral out like that, to see him fall into the grip of mental illness was completely heartbreaking. Joe began to sob uncontrollably into his pillow.\n\n\n\nThen there was a rustling sound and Joe looked up. His wife stood in the darkened hallway with a strange look on her face and a paper in her hand.\n\n\n\n“We need to talk, Joe.” Lydia said, throwing the paper down on Joe’s lap. Included was a picture of Joe and Leon together.\n\n\n\nJoe went from sorrow to shock. “What is this?”\n\n\n\n“You tell me!” she responded angrily. “Susan found this on her walk home. What the hell is it? What the hell is it, Joe!?”\n\n\n\nJoe picked up the letter and begun to read. His heart sank deeper with each word, tears falling down his face.\n\n\n\n“I can’t do this right now” he said, trying to convey everything with just the look in his eyes. “Please, give me some time. I promise I can explain all of this to you later.” They stared for a moment and she nodded.\n\n\n\nHe took the car out on some back roads and parked. He reclined his seat and screamed and sobbed and had moments of complete silence and nothingness. Eventually he fell asleep.\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\nThe next day he met with his wife in a secluded coffee shop. Joe explained for hours what had happened, confessing that he had been using money to help Leon. He explained the stalking and the delusions.\n\n\n\nAfter he was done he stared in her eyes for what seemed like forever. He could see her processing. And then, after eternity, her face softened and he could see trust return in her eyes.\n\n\n\nHe could tell, just from that penetrating glare, that she also understood the depth of sorrow he felt for his friend. He felt a deepening respect from her towards him, it wrapped him like a warm blanket. He knew, though the road was tough, they would now be stronger for this.\n\n\n",

    "passage": "Gilbert Duprez\n\n[[Image:GilbertDuprez.jpg|thumb|200px|\n\nGilbert Duprez\n\n]] GILBERT-LOUIS DUPREZ (6 December 180623 September 1896) was a French tenor, singing teacher and minor composer who famously pioneered the delivery of the operatic high C from the chest (_Ut de poitrine_, as Paris audiences called it). He also created the role of Edgardo in the popular bel canto-era opera _Lucia di Lammermoor_ in 1835.\n\n\nBiography\n\nGilbert-Louis Duprez was born in Paris. He studied singing, music theory, and composition with Alexandre-Étienne Choron and made his operatic début at the Odéon in 1825 as _Count Almaviva_ in Rossini's _Il barbiere di Siviglia_. He worked in that theatre without much success until 1828, when he decided to try his luck in Italy. There, the operatic scene was more active and developed. As a result, Duprez was able to immerse himself in work, beginning principally with _tenore contraltino_ roles such as _Idreno_ in '' Semiramide '' and _Rodrigo_ in _Otello_, both by Rossini. He appeared, too, as _Gualtiero_ in Bellini's _Il pirata_. The latter role proved to be his first undisputed stage success, probably because it was free of elaborate coloratura passages, which were not considered to be his strong suit as a vocalist.\n\nIn 1831, in Lucca, Duprez took part in the premiere Italian performance of _Guglielmo Tell_, singing for the first time (in an opera theatre) a high C sung not in the so-called falsettone register,[1] as other tenors of that time were accustomed to do, but with a full voice, often described as coming “from the chest”. His Italian career then proceeded on a highly successful course. It embraced, among other things, two premieres of operas by Donizetti, namely, _Parisina_ (in the role of Ugo) at Florence in 1832, and, more significantly, _Lucia di Lammermoor_ (in the role of Edgardo) at Naples' San Carlo in 1835. His Italian reputation strongly established, Duprez returned to Paris in 1837 and scored an immediate success at the Opéra with his exciting new style of vocal delivery as exemplified in _William Tell._ Consequently, he obtained equal billing with Adolphe Nourrit as “principal tenor” of the theatre. Nourrit responded by leaving for Italy in emulation of his competitor; but unlike Duprez, he failed to master the new singing style during studies with Donizetti and committed suicide.\n\nDuprez maintained his leading position at the Opéra until 1849, singing the title role in the première of Berlioz's _Benvenuto Cellini_ in 1838, and taking part in several further Donizetti premieres, including those of _La favorite_ (as Fernand) and _Les Martyrs_ (as Poliuto), both in 1840, and Dom Sébastien (in the title role), in 1843. Ironically the role of Poliuto, which Donizetti had written expressly for Nourrit in order to help him to maintain his exalted position, was to become associated in the public's mind with Duprez. [As Gaston in the première performance of Giuseppe Verdi's _Jérusalem_.] After singing in London at the Drury Lane theatre in the years 1843–1844, Duprez began to cut back on his stage performances, with a notable exception being the lead role in Giuseppe Verdi's _Jérusalem_. His last public appearance was in 1851 in _Lucia di Lammermoor_ at the Théâtre des Italiens. He then devoted himself to teaching, first at Paris's Conservatoire (where he had been appointed to a professorship as far back as 1842), and afterwards privately. His students included the celebrated French virtuoso bass Pol Plançon (1851–1914), whose voice is preserved on gramophone recordings made in 1902–1908. Duprez also devised a system of written exercises for singers and composed a few less than successful operettas.\n\nIn his 1880 book _Souvenirs d'un chanteur_, Duprez, a close friend of Donizetti's, related in deeply felt terms the bitter setbacks and obstructions which the Bergamo composer had suffered in the theatrical world.\n\nDuprez died at Poissy, near Paris, in 1896. He was the father of soprano Caroline Duprez.\n\n\nVocal character\n\nOne can differentiate two distinct phases in Duprez's artistic life. Initially, being equipped by nature with a clear but comparatively thin voice, he appears to have stood in the French _haute-contre_ tradition of singing. So, when he first went to Italy, he naturally assumed equivalent _tenore contraltino_ roles in operas written by Rossini. However, he failed to make any great impression on Italian audiences with his Rossinian endeavours, perhaps because of his deeply rooted disinclination to indulge in displays of coloratura.\n\nWhile in Italy, he began by modelling himself on the bel-canto tenor Rubini, whose bravura vocalism was a byword for sweetness and elegiac inflexion. Soon, however, he found a new source of inspiration in the person of Domenico Donzelli, the then greatest living “baritonal” tenor. Donzelli possessed a robust voice and a deliberately darkened timbre, coupled with firmly accented diction, immense nobility of phrasing and a vibrant, intense method of acting. The merging of Rubini and Donzelli's contrasting styles in Duprez, and the introduction of the famous high C from the chest (which soon became a standard feature of Romantic singing), gave rise to a fresh category of tenor, the _tenore di forza_. The dramatic tenor of the present day is a direct descendant in terms of range, tessitura and tonal thrust from this kind of mid-19th century voice first exemplified by Duprez.\n\nThe real origin of the “high C from the chest” is much disputed, nonetheless. For example, Paolo Scudo, a music critic employed by the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, considered that Manuel García, a tenor of an earlier generation to that of Duprez, was already capable of delivering the chest high C: but true or not, this reputed accomplishment does not diminish Duprez's historical significance. García (given his favoured style and personal taste) avoided delivering on stage any such “shriek of a strangulated capon” (as Rossini described the note's sound), whereas Duprez transformed it into “a cry of the soul”, over which innumerable tenors, for better or worse, have tortured themselves ever since. (Recently developed vocal techniques have enabled some modern-day lyric tenors to sing not only the chest high C, but also to execute the notorious high F in Bellini's _I puritani_ in a full head voice without resort to falsetto. The results, however, cannot be described as beautiful or alluring.)\n\nDuprez was a small man and, regrettably, the chest high C was an element of his vocal mechanism which soon took a toll on his physical resources. According to Berlioz, his voice sounded “hardened” as early as 1838, at the premiere of _Benvenuto Cellini_, and over the next 10 years, despite some isolated successes, his singing continued to deteriorate. Finally, Duprez was driven into an early retirement from the stage and he took up teaching.\n\n\nMusical and dramatic works\n\n[Duprez's original manuscript from _Jéliotte_, 1853] _(List from German Wikipedia)_\n\n-   _La Cabane du pechêur_, Comic Opera (Libretto: Edmond Duprez), 1st prodn. 1826\n-   _Le Songe du Comte Egmont_, Lyric Scena (Libretto: Edmond Duprez), 1st prodn. 1842\n-   _La Lettre au bon Dieu_, Comic Opera (Libretto: Eugène Scribe), 1st prodn. 1853\n-   _Jéliotte_, or _Un Passe-temps de duchesse_, Operetta, 1st prodn. 1854\n-   _Samson_, Operetta (Libretto by Edmond Duprez after Alexandre Dumas _père_), 1st prodn. 1857\n-   _Amélina_, 1860\n-   _La pazzia della regina_, 1st prodn. 1877\n-   _Tariotti_\n-   _Zephora_\n\n\nPublished writings\n\n-   _L'art du chant_, Paris, 1845 (accessible online in a French / German 1846 edition at IMSLP)\n-   ''La mélodie: Études complémentaires vocales et dramatiques de 'L'art du chant' '', Paris, Au Ménestrel, 1874 (accessible online at IMSLP)\n-   _Souvenirs d'un chanteur_, Paris, Levy, 1880 (accessible online at Gallica - B.N.F.)\n-   _Récréations de mon grand áge_ (2 volumes), Paris, 1888\n\n[1] 'Falsettone' is defined as a form of strengthened falsetto by which the white sounds in the upper notes are brightened and reinforced, while still remaining rather piercing and quivering.

    "passage": "[HM] Baker, Spy Guy\n\n*Cobras. Cobras. More Cobras.*\n\n\"Ha ha, Baker. It is I - Dr. Lox! Back from the dream world and now here to destroy you. I have fashioned a time machine of this watch and I can travel whenever! Wherever! I want!\"\n\n\"Time's up, Dr. Lox.\"\n\n\"Time's up? It's just begun!\" And he disappeared.\n\nThen he reappeared behind me and slapped me in the back of the head. Then he appeared in front of me and started dancing with the Dr. Lox behind me. Then two more Dr. Lox's appeared and joined in. Then more and more. Soon it was just a giant dance party of Dr. Lox's. \n\nI slowly walked out of the lair and they didn't notice me or the time machine watch I took. I went back and forth in time until I created my own dance party. Nothing ever came of it. But it's a simple lesson on how a time machine could be used to create dance parties.\n\n*Never Say Dying*\n\n\"Dr. Lox. It's me, Baker. I traveled back in time just before you killed me with all those volcanoes.\"\n\n\"Baker? Yes, I think I remember you. I have been stuck in a dream for millions of years. I am on the ninth level of dream-townville where you cannot escape your dream.\"\n\n\"That is the dumbest plot device I have ever heard of in my entire life.\"\n\n\"What about this Milk Way bar that turns into a car?\"\n\n\"Still.\"\n\n*Temptation to Terminate*\n\nDr. Lox was at it again. The entire building was sealed off and I was caught under the volcano that was aboard the spaceship that was headed towards the sun. \n\nI had no escape. What was worse is that the sun was about to explode.\n\nWorse still was that a black hole, unleashed by Dr. Lox, was moving slowly towards the sun. \n\nMy only chance was to activate the time machine watch I had and go back and stop Dr. Lox before any of this could occur. \n\nI reached for the watch, but it was on my other hand. \n\nThe hand that I left at home.\n\nDr. Lox walked in. He was holding my hand. \"You deserve a hand, Baker.\" He raised my hand and clapped his own hand with it.\n\nThen he threw the hand at me. \"Go ahead, Baker. Try to stop me.\"\n\nI grabbed the hand and put in the time coordinates to bring me back, but it turned out it was just a regular watch - a Seiko. \n\n\"Dr. Lox, only you can stop this now. If you don't, we will all be killed.\"\n\n\"Not me, Baker.\" Dr. Lox then produced the time machine watch. He smiled and disappeared. \n\nThat's when two more volcanoes appeared and started circling the ship. \n\n*Spy vs. Spy*\n\nSometimes, at night, I forget where I am and look up at the moon and think of Julia and all that could have been. Everything she was and everything she could be... \n\nShe was beautiful and I loved her. \n\nHer and those three holes she had.\n\n*Rangoon Noon*\n\nYou don't enter the spy game without training. \n\nMany movies will show training camps where you learn how to kill people with matchbox cars, jelly donuts, or giant hoagie sandwiches - those movies are really accurate and I helped consult on a few, but what they don't tell you is that you also learn how to kill people with VHS home movies, oversized stuffed animals, and Pepperidge Farm gift packs.\n\n*The End of the Road*\n\nPeople think that spying is easy. You just hide behind a wall and chew gum and watch what people do, right? Like maybe you just sit behind a wall and eat a hot dog and read comic books? Like you just sit in a vacant building and eat as many pies as you can and then the next day you try to eat more and you text your buddies on the progress? Or you sit with binoculars watching an arms deal while beating off?\n\nWell, you're wrong.\n\nExcept for the beating off thing. That happens all the time.\n\n*Sabotage!*\n\nI wired the dam with the explosives and waited. \n\nI needed to confirm all six kills, so there I was, high above the dam just waiting. Waiting for them to arrive.\n\nFinally, Schultz, Kramer, Demoine, Vernon, and Carlson pulled up.\n\nThere was no sign of Coco the Clown, until finally, he came cartwheeling down the road. The five others clapped and I pulled the trigger on the bomb.\n\nNothing.\n\nI ran down to the dam and checked the charges. Coco had brought out a unicycle and was riding the edge of the dam to the others' amusement. \n\nI made it to the wires just as Coco began juggling knives. \n\nSlowly, I realized I was no clown killer and decided to call the whole thing off. But then Coco lost his footing and fell to his death. \n\nI rewired the bomb, but then realized I couldn't kill the five mourners. They had been through too much. \n\nI walked down the mountain in shame, promising to end the spy business and become a clown.\n\nI never went through with it. But that was the one time I felt human for not killing a spy clown on a dam or a bunch of spies that were mourning a spy clown. \n\n*Brazen Liaison*\n\n\"Baker, it's Jessica. I want you to meet me at Big Ben.\"\n\n\"The clock or that bouncer from the Copa?\"\n\n\"The clock.\"\n\n\"OK. What time?\"\n\n\"Eight.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't be to hard to keep the time.\" I jested.\n\nShe laughed. But I could tell she didn't find it funny. There was lying in that laughter and I told her. \"You didn't find that funny, did you?\"\n\n\"No. I found it stupid.\"\n\n\"I have better material. I was just kinda off the cuff there.\"\n\n\"Just meet me there.\"\n\n\"OK.\" I put down the phone and worked on new material. I felt bad about the joke. \n\nI called her back. \"How will I find Big Ben?\"\n\n\"Still not funny.\"\n\nI slammed the phone down. I'm no comedian, but my Big Ben material should've killed. I was angry. \n\nI decided to go kill some spies.\n\nBut then I got tired and wrote more Big Ben jokes. \n\n*Deadly Deeds*\n\nWhen your caught in a corner and have no where to run it's time to pull out the big guns.\n\nIn this case, it was a small bomb encased in a tube of chapstick. You simply take the chapstick out, screw the bottom a couple of times and leave it to detonate within 50 seconds.\n\nThe problem was, we were in an elevator. I had to time the moment perfectly in order to get out of the elevator before the bomb went off. \n\n\"This is my floor.\" I said. \n\n\"It is mine too.\" My target said.\n\nI bet the look on my face when the elevator blew up was priceless. I tried to shrug it off, but he knew. So I shot him.\n\nI don't know why I didn't shoot him in the first place. It's always chapstick with me. I think I have a thing.\n\n*The Moon Can't Lie*\n\nIt was Venice. Venice again. \n\nOut the window I saw couples cavorting on the beach. Children swimming. Mimes miming. Dogs dogging. Cats catting. And a guy eating a hot dog.\n\nThe phone rang. \"Baker, it's Jessica. I need you.\"\n\n\"Not tonight, Jessica. It's too late.\"\n\n\"But there's couples cavorting, children swimming, mimes miming, dogs dogging, cats catting, and a guy eating a hot dog.\"\n\n\"Oh, wow. You're right. It's only noon. I still can't. I'm on assignment and my watch is broken.\"\n\n\"The watch I gave you?\"\n\n\"Why yes. Wait. It's a setup!\"\n\nI threw the watch out the window and it exploded. Mimes, people, hotdogs, and dogs and cats flew up into the air. It was like watching fireworks. \n\nIt made me think of Coco the Clown. And Julia. And her three holes. And Dr. Lox. It made me think of everything. Everything I once knew. That I...once loved.\n\nBut mainly, it made me think of people, mimes, hotdogs, dogs and cats and that bomb that went off.\n\n*Killing View*\n\n\"Baker! Ms. Parks is the assassin! I repeat - Parks is the assassin!\"\n\n\"Copy. I'll just poison her drink.\"\n\n\"Be careful.\"\n\n\"I will.\" I opened up the vial and realized I was out of poison again. \n\nTime to go to the poison store.\n\n*All Your Last Chances*\n\n\"We have 39 seconds.\"\n\n\"How many seconds now?\"\n\n\"37.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"36.\"\n\n\"Well, the clock works.\"\n\n*From Scandinavia with Love*\n\n\"Klinger - it's Baker. I cracked the code.\"\n\n\"Good man! We may just come through alive. What does the cipher say?\"\n\n\"It says that they are attacking at midnight - in Rio.\"\n\n\"Rio!\"\n\n\"Now to find out if they mean the city or that woman in the Duran Duran song.\"\n\n*Spies Alive*\n\n\"It's Baker. I see our target. They are the two with the cheeseburgers in the corner. The male has a mustache and the woman doesn't.\"\n\n\"I need more description. I have a bead on the entire restaurant, but I can't depend on that description.\"\n\n\"The female is wearing a Chewbacca mask.\"\n\n\"Roger.",

    "passage": "Nora Swinburne\n\nLEONORA MARY JOHNSON[1] (24 July 1902 – 1 May 2000), known professionally as NORA SWINBURNE, was an English actress. She is best known for her appearances in many British films.\n\n\nEarly years\n\nSwinburne was born in Bath, Somerset, the daughter of Henry Swinburne Johnson and his wife Leonora Tamar (née Brain). She was educated at Rosholme College, Weston-super-Mare, and studied for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. As a member of Clive Currie's Young Players in 1914, she appeared at the Grand, Croydon, Court and Little Theatres, during that year.\n\nIn 1914 she attended an audition with the ballerina Phyllis Bedells and later Anna Pavlova who considered her too young, even if very talented, for the corps de ballet. Nora instead joined the Italia Conti school where she obtained her first real part as a child actress in Where the Rainbow Ends. She performed in the show in London and in all the big cities of Britain for eighteen shillings (90p) a week.[2]\n\nAt the end of 1915 she gained a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. While still a student at the Academy she appeared at the New Theatre on 11 April 1916 as the Wild Flowers in _Paddly Pools_; appeared at the Comedy Theatre, September 1916, as a dancer in the revue, _This and That_; and in October 1916 appeared in _Samples_ at the Globe Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre). She also appeared at the Globe in March 1917 as Gabrielle in _Suzette_. Other early roles included Lulu in _Yes, Uncle!_ at the Prince of Wales Theatre in December 1917, and Regina Waterhouse at the Strand Theatre in December 1918.\n\nAt the Apollo Theatre in 1919 she played the title role in _Tilly of Bloomsbury_ “for about six weeks”, according to her personal notes in _Who's Who in the Theatre_, followed by the role of Roselle in _The Betrothal_ at the Gaiety in January 1921, concluding the year with what she charmingly called “several cinema plays”.[3]\n\n\nStage career\n\nSubsequent theatre roles included:\n\n-   Miss Dale Ogden in _The Bat_, St James's Theatre, January 1922\n-   Evadne in _The Mountebank_, Lyceum Theatre, New York, May 1923\n-   Sheila in _Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary_, Belasco Theatre, New York, September 1923\n-   Lorna Webster in _In the Next Room_, St Martin's Theatre, London, June 1924\n-   Veronica Duane in _You and I_, The Little Theatre, John Adam Street, London WC1, December 1924\n-   Joan Lee Tevis in _Tarnish_, Vaudeville Theatre, March 1925\n-   Nora in _Number 17_, New Theatre, August 1925\n-   Marion Lennox in _The Best People_, Lyric Theatre, March 1926\n-   Lady Blair in _Regatta_, and Ann in _Outward Bound_ by Sutton Vane, Prince of Wales Theatre, January 1928\n-   Susan Cunningham in _The Fourth Wall_, Haymarket, February 1928\n-   Hyacinth in _Out She Goes_ Criterion Theatre, December 1928\n-   Sonia in _Fame_, St James's Theatre, February 1929 (108 performances[4])\n-   Sylvia Arnitage in _Murder on the Second Floor_, Lyric Theatre, June 1929\n-   Yolande Probyn in _Lady Clara_, Booth Theatre, New York, April 1930\n-   Betty Mainwaring in _Lucky Dip_, Comedy Theatre, October 1930\n-   Laurel Prescottin in _The Ninth Man_, Prince of Wales Theatre, February 1931\n-   Helen in _Disturbance_, Grafton Theatre, July 1931\n-   Fay d’Allary in _The Gay Adventure_, Whitehall Theatre, December 1931\n-   Lady Moynton in _Never Come Back_, Phoenix Theatre, October 1932\n-   Anne Vernon in _It’s You I Want_, Daly's Theatre, February 1933\n-   Sybil Kingdom in _The Old Folks at Home_, Queen’s Theatre, December 1933\n-   Helen Storer in _Lovers’ Leap_, Vaudeville Theatre, October 1934\n-   Phyllis Manton in _All Rights Reserved_, Criterion Theatre, April 1935\n-   Helen Westdrake in _Disturbance_ (for Charta Theatre), Westminster Theatre, May 1935\n-   Marie in _Sauce for the Gander_, St Martin's Theatre, January 1936\n-   Judith Godfrey in _The King’s Leisure_, Daly’s Theatre, May 1936\n-   Louise Dexter in _The Astonished Ostrich_, Duke of York's Theatre, December 1936\n-   Tony Campion in _Wise To- Morrow_ (Stephen Powys), Lyric Theatre, February 1937 (first co-starring with future husband Esmond Knight as Peter Marsh)\n-   Lady Hazel in African Dawn, Daly’s Theatre, May 1937\n-   Maryka in _The Laughing Cavalier_, Adelphi Theatre, October 1937\n-   Edith Cartrwright in _Dodsworth_, Palace Theatre, February 1938\n-   Dinah Lot in _Lot’s Wife_ (for London International), Duke of York’s Theatre, April 1938; then under her own management at the Whitehall Theatre, June 1938; subsequently transferring to the Aldwych and Savoy Theatres.\n-   Fanny Grey in _Autumn Crocus_, King’s Theatre, Hammersmith, April 1939\n-   Ann Mordaunt in _Third Party Risk_, St Martin’s Theatre, May 1939\n-   Mrs Oswald Pink in _Married For Money_, Aldwych Theatre, November 1939\n-   Frances Courtenay in _The Peaceful Inn_, Duke of York’s Theatre, May 1940\n-   Mrs. Purdie in _Dear Brutus_ (Barrie), Globe Theatre, January 1941\n-   Sorel Tree in _Ducks and Drakes_, Apollo Theatre, November 1941\n-   Carole Markoff in _Full Swing_, Palace Theatre, April 1942\n-   Succeeded Valerie Taylor as Natalia Petrovna in _A Month in the Country_, St James’s Theatre, August 1943\n-   Succeeded Diana Wynyard as Sara Muller in _Watch on the Rhine_, Aldwych Theatre, October 1943\n-   Diana Wentworth in _The Years Between_, Wyndham’s Theatre, January 1945 (“which ran for over a year.”)\n-   Lady Clare Marten in _Miranda_, Embassy Theatre, June 1947\n-   Elsa Meredith in _Honour and Obey_, Saville Theatre, November 1947\n-   Caroline Ashley in _Caroline_, Arts Theatre, March 1949\n-   Jane Cooper in _Red Letter Day_, Garrick Theatre.

    "passage": "This is a story a girlfriend wrote about me where she kills me. I love it.\n\nCome Fly With Me\n\n\tWe are strolling along 3rd Street in Santa Monica, again, and our conversation, again, has turned stale.\n Again, because we are again at yet another start of our relationship, like the fourth or fifth time really. We\n don't talk for six months then we start all over, small talk and getting to know each other and first dates all\n over \nagain. Not fourth or fifth time we have tried to make it work, but maybe really the fourth or fifth time that we\n have forgotten why we donít work out together (because you are a self absorbed, emotionally void prick) and \nthen we run into each other (usually in some bizarre place where we find that we have yet another thing in\n common) and exchange conversation (really just witty one liners) that made us remember what we liked about\n each other (and that I don't remember because I haven't run into you in a while).\n\tWe walked arm in arm, silent, with both my arms holding onto your one arm. We stop to watch one of the\n street performers. Some Asian idiot with like thirty bowls threw them up in series of like three bowls at a time,\n then caught them on his head until he had al thirty bowls up there. Some people just have that knack for\n balance I guess. They are able to throw everything up in the air and have everything land all choreographed\n and perfect right on top of they're fucking heads.\n\tI put my hand on your neck and slowly run my fingers through your short hair. I always liked that despite\n everything, any adversity or state of strife, you always kept your hair nice and short. I run my hair up the back\n again and feel the top of your head. It is all bumpy and uneven. Ha, you probably wouldnít even be able to\n catch one bowl. I touch the top of my head. Hmmm, bumps and lumps and bulges, but one flat spot in the back.\n\tThe man ends with thirty bowls balanced on various locations on his petite, sinewy little body. The crow cheers and people smile. We walk away before he asks for tips.\n\tWe walk up to the sushi restaurant that we had reservations at. You suggest that we sit outside.\n\tSome things never change. You order the same sushi that you have ordered since the first date we ever\n went on. The same tuna that I can never remember the name of or how they prepare it whenever I eat sushi\n without you. The name I just canít quite remember and the waitress can never guess it correctly. Even writing\n this now I can't remember what the name is.\n\tBut you order it and I tell her I will have the same. And we sip our hot saki and look at each other from\n across the table. A list of my vices runs through my head: thin boys with dark hair and light eyes and pale\n skin, smoking, drinking...\n\tI see you have dyed your hair black, it suits you well.Suits me well because it is attractive or suits me\n well because it is black? You look away with that drawn out smirking smile. The sound of your voice has that\n slightly effeminate quality to it, with exaggerated ups and downs.\n\tYou look back up at me. In my eyes. What is important here is that you donít look anyone in the eyes\n when you talk to them. It is quite bizarre really. Maybe a habit from doing drugs, maybe because your big\n black pupils give you away. I can know you and know you, and never really know what the fuck you are\n thinking. If you are really here or somewhere else. I remember a girlfriend told me once there was only one\n part of a man she could ever figure out.\n\tDid you call me to fuck me or be friends?í I ask this very candidly hoping to achieve some shock value\n that would result in honesty.I don't know. God, fucking honesty. Half of me wants to fuck your brains out and\n the other part of me wants to be friends. Fuck honesty, this is too confusing. What am I doing here? How many\n other times have I been in this same exact moment? I set myself up for deja vu.\n\tWhat do you think? you ask me, looking at me.Honestly, I do not know what to think. I could go either\n way, I guess.Fuck me, I have been here a million times and no matter if I give the fuck or friend answer, I\n always end up with the fuck.\n\tYou really are gorgeous. You look at me with those fuck me eyes. Those light green, dark hair, light skin\n fuck me eyes. But you know that. And it is true. I do know that. Too bad just being gorgeous cannot constitute\n a whole relationship. Too bad for you, I think. But really too bad for me.\n\tYou are quiet tonight. I am wondering really if I want to do this whole routine all over again. The flat spot\n on my head can catch a few bowls, but your head would never catch anything.\n\tI am quiet every night.í I donít know why I say this, but I just do. Then I quickly jump to something else.\n I donít want you to start thinking that Im thinking about us.\n\tWouldn't that just be just to bizarre to be a street performer? Working for tips, juggling and dancing\n around and shit. Spray painting your self with silver spray paint every morning to pretend you are a fucking\n robot. Putting a box one your head and acting like youíre a television.\n\tYou laugh. Some people sit at computer screens everyday for twelve hours inputting numbers. That is\n equally strange.í\n\tOur sushi arrives and then you read the same sushi script I now know by heart:\n\tSee the juice on the bottom. Thatís lemon juice. Itís acidity cooks the raw fish, and you can see that on\n the top where it is white colored. This is \nmy favorite. The only thing I have ever ordered and will ever order.The tuna is this little slimy, juicy pink\n mound, the size of my small fist. It is sliced into about ten thin pieces. I am done eating in a few minutes and\n the drink the rest of my miso soup. You are done too and fold your napkin. There is still like three or four\n slices on your plate. And your soup is half full. And you rice has not been touched. You have gone through two\n or three bottles of saki though.\n\tNothing is more simultaneously amusing and depressing that the charade of a drug addict pretending to\n eat. I wonder if you feel sick. I wonder what drugs you are on. I look at your collar bones through your shirt\n and cheekbones, and I am sure probably every other bone later tonight.\n\tYou ask if I want the rest of yours or are still hungry for anything else, and I say no. So we light up and\n smoke while we wait for the check.\n\tSo, what on earth should we do for the rest of the evening?í I ask you with tired enthusiasm in my voice.\n\tLets just walk. So indefinite, so open. That was just like you.\n\tWe walk along the store fronts and look in but not really seeing. We huddle together because it has\n become quite cold. At the end of 3rd street a man with a key board plays and sings Frank Sinatra.\n\tLets stop and listen.í I pull your arm and we sit on a bench off to the side and smoke.\n\tI want to hear ëCome Fly With Me, tell him. And you walk to him and tell him.\n\tThis is my favorite Sinatra song. And we sit in, huddled together, long after the song stops and the next\n one comes on.\n\tWe could get into a lot of trouble together.í You have often told this to me and I am never quite sure if you mean trouble together or with other people.\n\tI have been in this exact moment a hundred other times with you. Again, the scheming script:\n\tSo what if I called you and I had a different name, like Miranda or Judith or whatever. And then I said I know so and so and she said that we would really hit it off and we should go out. And we could first date as other people. Totally different people that we could create. Like I would be a \nveterinary assistant and you would be a gynecologist named Carlo.í You laughed.\n\tAnd then it would be like date rape you know. It would totally be hot.í I was getting into this, ha this would be funny and definitely not boring. And then we would go out, as Carlo and Miranda, and go to dinner and the movies or whatever. Then you would invite me over for a coffee and I would accept because you were so romantic and charming and witty and talk talk. Then after the coffee you would drink a few scotches and start coming on really heavy. And like touching me. And then I would get all upset and tell you stop like five times and then threaten to leave and then you get forceful. I make a break for the door and then you stop me and rape.í\n\tOne question. Why would a gynecologist be living in a studio apartment in Santa Monica?í He laughs. Cause his mansion is being renovated. I donít fucking know. Think big picture. Think rape scene. Think trapped against the wall of your apartment with my arms pinned down by your arms. And Iím wearing a white dress with a black purse.You contemplate this and laugh. ëMe and you could get into a lot of trouble. But I think you already know that.í\n\tWe sit and talk out other schemes, other worlds and lives that are far from our own.Well, Iíll tell you a\n scheme.í You lean in closer. ëWell, you know the guy at the bar, the one that is always there, blond hair,\n maybe light brown. Light eyes and good teeth with a different girl on his arm every night of \nthe week. Picks fights and rips people off. Has an expensive new truck but hardly works. Great house great \nroom mates and tons of friends. The guy whose ass everyone kisses.í\n\tNamed Chris or Nick or Tyler or Tony. Yeah, sure those guys are fucking everywhere.Well, we go to the\n bar and find him, Chris, Nick, Tyler Or Tony. Then we lure him back to the car, drug him with rufies, take him\n back with us, then strip him down and leave him all naked in Mexico or San Franís gay bars or whatever.\n\tThatís very good, very trouble.í You smile that lets me know this is a good idea.Not really revenge\n oriented, more just for kicks.Yeah, for kicks. You stop and think.We stop talking and listen to Sinatra some \nmore. Come Fly With Me comes on again.\nSo which bar do we find him a. Hook, line and sinker. I do believe the contestant has entered into the first \nround.The Yucatan.He nods and smiles in agreement.\n\n\tSo we go out that night, a Friday night. And I really do look fantastic. And we park in the very far back of\n the lot, under a tree where no one can see us. We take your big black truck, for storage of the body\npurposes.And tonite I wear a red dress. Blood red. Short and sweet, you can see me across the crowded \nbar.And so al night I am talking to different guys, and you watch from across the room, waiting for me to hook\n just the right one. And I will say to him lets have a drink together, along, in my truck. And raise my eyebrows \nand lick my lips or fucking whatever to lure this guy back.I am at the bar for like thirty minutes and I head back\n to you.Well, did you get one yet? No theyíre all too nice, I need one that's a real ass.I thought this isn't about\n revenge?\n\tI look at you dead cold in the eyes, no emotion just plain truth: Well, maybe it is.You just stare back at\n me.I smile and break this tension. Babe, letís go back to the truck and have a drink and a cig. I need a break.\n You grab my hand and we walk out. The night is cold, so we walk fast and you hold me close to your ribby\n chest.\n\tWe get into your truck and light a cigarette. I open the large duffel bag and take out a bottle of Jagermeuster and break the seal. I open a little cooler and pour it into a glass with cloudy ice cubes.For you\n babe.I fix myself one, sans the ice. We sit in silence for a good ten minutes.\n\tYou sip and talk. ëI really like you. I donít know why I do the things I do to you. I donít talk, I just listen.\n\tëI am really sorry for the way I treat you sometimes, I really donít know why I do it.í Your voice is\n slurring just a bit. God, I feel drunk, and this is only my second drink. I smile. I just want you to know that I want to be your friend. We can be good friends Yes, I am sure we can. \nYour head begins to nod.What the fuck, did you put sommmmeeething in here? You swing your head around at\n me. I smile. \n No you couldnít haaaaaaave. You broke the seal.\n\tYes, I broke the seal.\n\tHow thinning?\n\tThe ice cubes, friend. In the ice, dear sweet good friend.í I smile again.\n\tThe ruuuufies?\n\tYes, and the cyanide,í I say with a genuine smile this time.\n\tThe cyyyyyyyanide, there was no cyaaaaaaaaanideí Then you get it but are \nparalyzed. And you canít hold your head any longer and it lazily flops to the head rest.\n\tFriend, lover, I was poison from the beginning.í",

He sacrificed five fine tubers to the spud gods – death via peel – before settling on the correct shape. He drew red lines on the winner to simulate seams, only to see them erased by the potato's weeping. He wielded that peeler like a true artiste.\n\nBecause in order to pull off the greatest prank in baseball history, Bresnahan needed to shape a potato like a baseball.\n\n\"I went to Williamsport (Pa.) this past weekend to celebrate the anniversary,\" Bresnahan says today from his Arizona home, 20 years after he ended his career as a catcher for the Double-A Williamsport Bills by feigning to pick off an opponent at third base by chucking a potato into left field, then using the real baseball to tag the runner when he scurried home – a hidden-ball trick to end all hidden-ball tricks.\n\n\"They gave away bobbleheads. I'm holding a potato. THERE'S ONE ON EBAY RIGHT NOW. A couple sold for over a hundred bucks this week. For kicks and giggles, I looked up what Barry Bonds' was selling for, and I'm crushing him.\n\n\"I really don't understand.\"\n\nThere really isn't much to understand. Baseball is a stately game, sometimes too serious for its own good. There are no end-zone dances, no tongue-wagging after dunks, no cha-cha lines following goals. Should Tommy Lasorda falling on his ample keister really constitute the apotheosis of baseball humor?\n\nNo, sir. To allow an idea so unique, so brilliant and so hilarious to fade into history's annals, then, would be disrespectful not only to the game but to the man who hatched the plan and executed it to perfection.\n\nThe tater plot started in the bullpen, sanctuary for baseball's bored. Relief pitchers pass the time by scoping out women or making up silly games involving sunflower seeds. As the .149-hitting backup, Bresnahan spent plenty of time in the 'pen, and he broached the idea that had cooked in his mind for years. John Stuart Mill would have been proud of the marketplace of ideas that commenced. A roll of tape would be too light, a rosin bag too fluffy.\n\n\"And then it came to me: a potato,\" Bresnahan says. \"Mainly because it sounds funny.\"\n\nWord filtered around the Bills' clubhouse about Bresnahan's plan, and with the team more than 20 games out of first place, it gave players something to anticipate. The schedule gave Bresnahan a perfect chance. He knew he would play at least one game against the Reading Phillies in an Aug. 31 doubleheader, and the Phillie Phanatic was showing up that day too, ensuring a big crowd.\n\nA few games before potato day, Bresnahan caught a game against the Phillies. He tried to pick a runner off third base, the first piece of bait in his elaborate hornswoggle.\n\n\"There was a lot of premeditation in this,\" Bresnahan says. \"I'm kind of anal that way. When I plan something out, I want to make sure the details are covered. In order for this to really work, I needed a guy on third with two outs. When I did it, all the guys on the field would hustle back into the dugout. That way if the umpire ruled against us, we'd have to run back out on the field. And then it's more dramatic.\"\n\nEarlier that week, Bresnahan called major-league umpire Tim Tschida, a friend of a teammate, and asked how he would rule the potato play. Tschida said he would return the runner to third base, end of story. If it was good enough for Tschida, Bresnahan figured, it worked for him.\n\nIn the fifth inning, the time came. Two outs. Runner Rick Lundblade on third. Bresnahan told home-plate umpire Scott Potter the webbing of his glove had broken. Potter allowed him into the dugout, where a glove with the peeled potato waited. Teammates giggled. Bresnahan told them to shut up.\n\nThe potato remained in Bresnahan's glove until he called the pitch, an outside slider that had little chance of being put into play. During the windup, Bresnahan transferred the potato to his bare hand.\n\n\"It wasn't that bad a throw,\" Bresnahan says. \"It was supposed to be bad. But it was smaller. It was moist. I was nervous. I came up firing. As I threw it, I said, 'Oh, no.' It was headed right toward his helmet. It just missed.\"\n\nThird baseman Rob Swain, flummoxed by the good throw, tried to sell it by doing his best olé. The potato hit the ground and exploded into three pieces. Lundblade never saw it. He had started running home.\n\n\"I tagged him and showed him the ball, then rolled it to the mound and ran toward the dugout,\" Bresnahan says. \"All my teammates buried their faces in their gloves and were laughing. They couldn't move. I told them to get off the field.\"\n\nBehind the plate, Potter was confused. The third-base umpire ran into the outfield and retrieved the biggest chunk. \"It's a (expletive) potato,\" he yelled to Potter.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Potter asked Bresnahan.\n\n\"It's just a joke,\" he replied.\n\nPotter awarded Lundblade home and the scorekeeper charged Bresnahan with an error. Bresnahan wasn't ejected, but Williamsport manager Orlando Gomez yanked him from the game immediately and fined him $50. That night, celebrating over post-game beers, Bresnahan's teammates started a fund to pay the fine.\n\nWhen Bresnahan showed up at the stadium the following day, Gomez called him in his office. Jeff Scott, farm director of Williamsport's parent team, the Cleveland Indians, was on the phone. Bresnahan knew Scott from their days in the Seattle organization. Scott laughed, told Bresnahan he was an idiot and said he needed to release him.\n\nAnd thus ended Dave Bresnahan's baseball career. Though he did make one more trip that season to the ballpark. Later that day, Bresnahan returned from the grocery store with huge sacks of potatoes. He placed 50 of them on Gomez's desk.\n\n\"I'm always fearful that people think I'm a goofball,\" Bresnahan says. \"I am a prankster. I've got a good sense of humor. But I love baseball.\n\n\"I'm a historian. I'm an old-fashioned guy. I've been a season-ticket holder for the Diamondbacks. I coach my kids. Everything I do counters what I'm known for, which is the damn potato.\"\n\nPaul Harvey called because of the damn potato. So did Harry Caray and countless other baseball emissaries. Bresnahan remains revered in Japan, where, for the 10-year anniversary of the potato caper, a TV station flew him out. They asked him to wear his Bills uniform – \"a 10-pound sausage,\" he says, \"into a five-pound casing\" – placed him on a throne and carried him through a smoke machine.\n\nEvery day someone reminds Bresnahan of the potato, whether at his job as a project manager for a company refurbishing an old Texas sugar plant or through a letter thanking him for bringing levity to a staid game. The potato itself is the prized possession of the Baseball Reliquary, the museum of oddities that DISPLAYS IT IN JAR FILLED WITH DENATURED ALCOHOL.\n\nIn January, Bresnahan spent a week at the Diamondbacks' fantasy camp. His fellow campers weren't interested in the vagaries of minor-league life or what it was like to play for Mike Hargrove in A ball. They wanted to know about the potato.\n\nAnd when he told them about it, they laughed like hell.\n",

    "passage": "Alice's Restaurant (film)\n\n_'_ Alice's Restaurant _'_ is a 1969 American comedy film directed by Arthur Penn. It is an adaptation of the 1967 folk song “Alice's Restaurant Massacree”, originally written and sung by Arlo Guthrie. The film stars Guthrie as himself, with Pat Quinn as Alice Brock and James Broderick as Ray Brock. Penn, who resided in the story's setting of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, co-wrote the screenplay in 1967 with Venable Herndon after hearing the song, shortly after directing _Bonnie & Clyde_.[1]\n\n_Alice's Restaurant_ was released on August 19, 1969, a few days after Guthrie appeared at the Woodstock Festival. A soundtrack album for the film was also released by United Artists Records. The soundtrack includes a studio version of the title song, which was originally divided into two parts (one for each album side); a 1998 CD reissue on the Rykodisc label presents this version of the song in full, and adds several bonus tracks to the original LP.\n\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1965, Arlo Guthrie (as himself) has attempted to avoid the draft by attending college in Montana. His long hair and unorthodox approach to study gets him in trouble with local police as well as residents. He quits school, and subsequently hitchhikes back East. He first visits his father Woody Guthrie (Joseph Boley) in the hospital.\n\nArlo ultimately returns to his friends Ray (James Broderick) and Alice Brock (Pat Quinn) at their home, a deconsecrated church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts where they welcome friends and like-minded bohemian types to “crash”. Among these are Arlo's school friend Roger (Geoff Outlaw) and artist Shelley (Michael McClanathan), an ex-heroin addict who is in a motorcycle racing club. Alice is starting up a restaurant in nearby Stockbridge. Frustrated with Ray's lackadaisical attitude, she has an affair with Shelley, and ultimately leaves for New York to visit Arlo and Roger. Ray comes to take her home, saying he has invited a “few” friends for Thanksgiving.\n\nThe central point of the film is the story told in the song: After Thanksgiving dinner, Arlo and his friends decide to do Alice and Ray a favor by taking several months worth of garbage from their house to the town dump. After loading up a red VW microbus with the garbage, and “shovels, and rakes and other implements of destruction”, they head for the dump. Finding the dump closed for the holiday, they drive around and discover a pile of garbage that someone else had placed at the bottom of a short cliff. At that point, as mentioned in the song, “...we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down.”\n\nThe next morning they receive a phone call from “Officer Obie” (Police Chief William Obanhein as himself), who asks them about the garbage. After admitting to littering, they agree to pick up the garbage and to meet him at the police officers' station. Loading up the red VW microbus, they head to the police station where they are immediately arrested.\n\nAs the song puts it, they are then driven to the quote scene of the crime unquote where the police are engaged in a hugely elaborate investigation. At the trial, Officer Obie is anxiously awaiting the chance to show the judge the 27 8x10 color glossy photos of the crime but the judge (James Hannon as himself) happens to be blind, using a seeing eye dog, and simply levies a $25 fine, orders them to pick up the garbage and then sets them free. The garbage is eventually taken to New York and placed on a barge. Meanwhile, Arlo has fallen in love with a beautiful Asian girl, Mari-chan (Tina Chen).\n\nLater in the movie, Arlo is called up for the draft, in a surreal depiction of the bureaucracy at the New York City military induction center on Whitehall Street. He attempts twice to make himself unfit for induction, first by getting drunk the night before and performing the physical exams while hung over, then by acting like a homicidal maniac in front of the psychiatrist, but fails both times (the latter incident actually gets him praise). Because of Guthrie's criminal record for littering, he is first sent to the Group W bench (where convicts wait), then outright rejected as unfit for military service, not because of the littering incident, but because he makes a remark about the dubiousness of considering littering to be a problem when selecting candidates for armed conflict, making the officials suspicious of “his kind” and them to send his personal records to Washington, DC.\n\nUpon returning to the church, Arlo finds Ray and members of the motorcycle club showing home movies of a recent race. Shelley enters, obviously high, and Ray beats him until he reveals his stash of heroin, concealed in some art he has been working on. Shelley roars off into the night on his motorcycle to his death; the next day, Woody dies. Ray and Alice have a hippie-style wedding in the church, and a drunken Ray proposes to sell the church and start a country commune instead, revealing that he blames himself for Shelley's death. The film ends with Alice standing alone in her bedraggled wedding gown on the church steps.\n\n\nCast\n\n-   Arlo Guthrie as himself\n-   Pat Quinn as Alice Brock\n-   James Broderick as Ray Brock\n-   Pete Seeger as himself\n-   Lee Hays as himself – reverend at evangelical meeting\n-   Michael McClanathan as Shelly\n-   Geoff Outlaw as Roger Crowther\n-   Tina Chen as Mari-chan\n-   Kathleen Dabney as Karin\n-   William Obanhein as himself – Officer Obie\n-   James Hannon as himself – the blind judge\n-   Seth Allen as Evangelist\n-   Monroe Arnold as Bluegrass\n-   Joseph Boley as Woody Guthrie\n-   Vinnette Carroll as Draft Clerk\n-   Sylvia Davis as Marjorie Guthrie\n-   Simm Landres as Private Jacob / Jake\n-   Eulalie Noble as Ruth\n-   Louis Beachner as Dean\n-   MacIntyre Dixon as First Deconsecration Minister\n-   Arthur Pierce Middleton as Second Deconsecration Minister\n-   Donald Marye as Funeral Director\n-   Shelley Plimpton as Reenie\n-   M. Emmet Walsh as Group W Sergeant\n\n\nCameos and special appearances\n\nThe real Alice Brock makes a number of cameo appearances in the film. In the scene where Ray and friends are installing insulation, she is wearing a brown turtleneck top and has her hair pulled into a ponytail. In the Thanksgiving dinner scene, she is wearing a bright pink blouse. In the wedding scene, she is wearing a Western-style dress.\n\nStockbridge police chief William Obanhein (“Officer Obie”) plays himself in the film, explaining to _Newsweek_ magazine that making himself look like a fool was preferable to having somebody else make him look like a fool.[2] Judge James E. Hannon, who presided over the littering trial, also appears as himself in the film.[3] Many of Guthrie's real-life associates in Stockbridge made appearances as extras, and Penn, who himself had a home in Stockbridge,[4] spent time living among them in an effort to grasp their lifestyle.[5] Guthrie and all of the extras were housed at the same hotel during filming of scenes outside Stockbridge, but Guthrie received star treatment; a limousine was provided for Guthrie each morning while the others had to find their own transportation for filming. This strained the relations between Guthrie and his friends for many years.[6] Much of the film was recorded in Stockbridge.[7]\n\nThe film also features the first credited film appearance of character actor M. Emmet Walsh, playing the Group W sergeant. (Walsh had previously appeared as an uncredited extra in _Midnight Cowboy_, released three months prior.) The film also features cameo appearances by American folksingers/songwriters Lee Hays (playing a reverend at an evangelical meeting) and Pete Seeger (playing himself).\n\n\nDifferences from real life\n\nThe original song “Alice's Restaurant Massacree” that formed the basis for the film's central plotline was, for the most part, a true story. However, other than this and the hippie wedding at the end of the film, most of the other events and characters in the film were fictional creations of the screenplay's writers. According to Guthrie on the DVD's audio commentary, the film used the names of real people but took numerous liberties with actual events. Richard Robbins, Guthrie's co-defendant in real-life, was replaced by the fictional Roger Crowther for the film (in the song, he remained anonymous); he later described almost all the additions to the story as “all fiction” and “complete bull.”[8] The subplots involving the Shelly character were completely fictional and not based on any real people or incidents in Guthrie's life;[9] his character's motorcycle club was loosely based on the Trinity Motorcycle Club (or, by a conflicting account, the Triangle Motorcycle Club), a real-life group of motorcyclists that associated with the Brocks and were alluded to in another Guthrie song, the “Motorcycle Song”.[10] The film also has Guthrie being forced to leave a Montana town after “creating a disturbance” – i.e., several town residents object to Guthrie's long hair and gang up to throw him through a plate glass window. This never happened, and Guthrie expresses regret that Montana got a “bad rap” in the film. In reality, during the time of the littering incident and trial, Guthrie was still enrolled in a Montana college, and was only in Stockbridge for the long Thanksgiving weekend (he would drop out of college at the end of the semester).[11]\n\nAlice Brock has spoken very negatively of the film's portrayal of her.[12] She stated in a 2014 interview “That wasn't me. That was someone else's idea of me.”[13] Brock took particular offense at the film implying that she had slept with Guthrie (among others) and noted that she had never associated with heroin users.[14] She also noted that the song and film brought a large amount of unwanted publicity: “It just really impinged on your privacy. It's just amazing how brazen people can be when you're a supposed public figure (...) We sold the church at that point.”[15]\n\n\nReception\n\nThe film has a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.19/10.[16] In 2009, _Politics Daily_ wrote that, “calling the 1969 film a comedy misses its _noir_ backbeat of betrayed romanticism, and thinking of it as a madcap autobiography misses its politics. This is a movie driven by the military draft and the Vietnam War”.[17]\n\nUpon its initial release, _Newsweek_ called the film “the best of a number of remarkable new films which seem to question many of the traditional assumptions of establishment America.”[18]\n\nWhen interviewed in 1971, the film's director, Arthur Penn, said of the film: “What I tried to deal with is the US's silence and how we can best respond to that silence. ... I wanted to show that the US is a country paralyzed by fear, that people were afraid of losing all they hold dear to them. It's the new generation that's trying to save everything”.[19]\n\nIn being offered the opinion that violence is not so important in the film, Penn replied: “_Alice's Restaurant_ is a film of potential transition because the characters know, in some way, what they are looking for. ... It's important to remember that the characters in _Alice's Restaurant_ are middle-class whites. They aren't poor or hungry or working class. They are not in the same boat as African Americans. But they're not militants either. In this respect the church dwellers are not particularly threatening. They find it easy to live there, even if most people can't afford such a luxury. From this point of view, this film depicts a very specific social class. It's a bourgeois film”.[20]\n\nThe final scene is not of a loving couple seeing off their guests, but of Alice standing alone looking into the distance, watching the guests leave, as if knowing that her future is in fact bleak with Ray.[21] Coincidentally, the real Alice and Ray finalized their divorce on the same day the wedding scene was filmed.[22] Arthur Penn has said that the final scene was intended as comment on the inevitable passing of the counterculture dream: “In fact, that last image of Alice on the church steps is intended to freeze time, to say that this paradise doesn’t exist any more, it can only endure in memory”.[23] Gene Siskel of the _Chicago Tribune_ listed _Alice's Restaurant_ as third best film of 1969.[24]\n\nThe film grossed $6,300,000[25] in the United States, making it the 23rd highest-grossing film of 1969.\n\n\nAwards\n\n-   Nominated for Academy Award for Best Director (1969) – Arthur Penn[26]\n-   Nominated for Writers Guild of America Award for Best Drama Written Directly for the Screen (1970) – Venable Herndon, Arthur Penn\n-   Third Place – Laurel Awards – Golden Laurel for Comedy (1970)\n-   Nominated for British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards – Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music (1971) – Arlo Guthrie\n\n[1] Cummings, Paula (November 21, 2017).

    "passage": "[SF] Dave's Problem\n\nDave was too drunk have driven himself home. Not black out drunk, but drunk enough that he shouldn’t have driven. But he made it home all in one piece. Mostly due to luck. \n\nIt was a dark night, lit only by the streetlamp that was too far away to really do much help. The local kids (or whoever) had busted most of them. The local DOT had long since stopped caring. The only reason the one remained was that they needed some light to conduct business at night. Dave didn’t care, not really, this house was the best that he could afford. Of course, the other benefit was that none of the neighbors complained when Dave didn’t trim the bushes. Wasn’t quite like a trek into the rain forest walking up his front step, but it was getting there.\n\nIt wasn’t very alarming that the front door wasn’t locked. The decrepit piece of shit probably wouldn’t have kept anyone out if they really wanted in. Luckily, Dave didn’t have much. In fact, other than Natty Ice in the fridge, he had almost nothing. Plus, he had already been six or so beers in before he drove to Three Blind Mice. Despite it’s fruity name, it was only a place real drinkers went. The rest couldn’t hang. At least that’s what they told each other.\n\nWhat was silently more alarming was when his only lamp turned on, mostly because Dave was still clear across the room from it. The light from the lamp revealed a well-dressed man in what appeared to be Dave’s recliner, drug over next the lamp for effect. He was about medium build, glasses, bearded, looking clam and serene.\n\n“Hello Dave, nice of you to join me,” the visitor said, as if this was his house and he had been expecting Dave for some time.\n\n“Who the fuck…” Dave’s voice trailed off as his eyes finally focused on the gun in the stranger’s hand. “Look man, I don’t got anything, besides some cheap beer and that chair you’re sitting in. But man, I found that outside the house where that old lady died, I’m pretty sure that she died in…” Dave stopped talking as the well-dressed man put the index finger of his non-gun hand to his lips. Would have been pretty funny sight, except for the gun. That made if funny in a morbid sort of way.\n\n“Dave, Dave, Dave,” he said once Dave had quieted down, “I didn’t come here to hear what you had to say, I’m going to talk a bit, you’re going to die, and the world will be a better place.”\n\nIt wasn’t exactly what he said that was so terrifying, though it was, it was how he said it. The man had stated the whole chain of events almost like he was reading it from a history book, that’s how certain he was of the chain of events.\n\n“Listen man, whatever I did to you, I’m really sorry, can, I, uh, do anything for you?” Dave had no idea what he had done but he had pissed off a lot of people, this was hardly a surprising turn of events.\n\n“There is simply nothing you can say to make up to me what you took from me,” the man started, the calm veneer slipping a bit, some anger poking through. He then composed himself, “But, I’m getting ahead of myself. If you wouldn’t be a dear and sit in the folding chair I’ve put over there.” As he said the last part, he motioned with a gun to a folding chair that had “Property of Jack’s Party World” printed on it. Dave had stolen that a long time ago. Dave went along because that seemed the thing to do.\n\n“You see Dave,” he continued, “Five years from now you’re going to get blindly drunk one night, so drunk that you don’t realize that your liquor refill run isn’t taking place in the middle of the night, but at 6 in the morning. Honest mistake, it being the middle of winter and all. You’re so drunk that you claim that you never saw the red light. And you certainly didn’t see Jenny, that was my wife’s name, crossing the intersection. Maybe you saw her car as you flew out your windshield, past her car, and only the nearby embankment, suffering only a cut above your eye. A cut that witnesses at the scene filmed you screaming about as if it was life threatening while my wife was pinned in her car, bleeding to death.”\n\n“Man, I ain’t never been in an accident before…” Dave started to complain before the loud bang and the searing pain in his foot.\n\n“Couple of things,” the man said, oddly calm for just having shot a man in the foot, “I hate being interrupted, first, and second, you’re not listening. The collision, not accident, will not happen for another five years and change. But you’re jumping ahead and unless you’d like a shot in the other foot, I suggest you quiet down.”\n\nThere was a pause before the well-dressed man took Dave’s silence for agreement.\n\n“In court you were so fucking contrite. You had dressed up nice and told the judge about your mom’s drinking, how your wife had left you, how you had no support system and that’s how you ended up the asshole driving drunk at 6 in the morning. Of course, the judge felt for you, sent you to rehab and time served. Time served. For murdering my wife. Do you know what Jenny did in her free time? The free time she had leftover from her job helping children find parents to adopt them? She used to read to the elderly at a local nursing home. She was too good for me and she was worth way more than time served and rehab for some asshole.\n“I’m a very clever man, you can ask almost anyone. When Jenny was alive, I used that to work for the government, designing weapon systems. After you murdered her, I realized how fucking pointless all that was. All I wanted was my Jenny back. So, after crying for a while, I set to work on my greatest invention. It took decades but eventually I did it. I created the machine that took me from my basement to your backyard. I would offer to show you but, well, I don’t give a fuck about you.”\n\nDave was way too drunk for this. His foot was starting to throb and this guy was seeming crazier and crazier with every minute, even if his delivery was calm, cool, and collected.\n\n“You see, Dave, it was at that moment that I had a realization, the only memories I would ever have of Jenny would be from the moment I jumping back in time forward. Some version of me would live the other part of that life. I thought I had fixed my problem but I hadn’t, I would never remember any of it. All the birthdays, any children, none of it would actually be my memories. My work had been worth it because Jenny would get to live, but me, I still lost. That’s when I decided that instead of going back to that day and giving Jenny a flat or something simple, I would come back in time and kill you.”\n\nDave’s mouth got instantly dry at the way that the man had said “kill you” without any emotion at all.\n\n“Of course, it wouldn’t do to have the me who was living now arrested for your murder, that would make things even worse, especially since I would have no idea what had happened. I wouldn’t have really been innocent, but close enough. And then it occurred to me, right now, the me of your time is 12 hours away from her on a bachelor party for my brother in law. He is a cop. All his friends are cops. I was the only ‘civilian’ invited. Sure, they might question me, but I was right now sitting in a bar a time zone away, drinking with 6 cops in a bar full of witnesses. I almost feel bad for the detective who has to solve this case.” The man was smiling a bit as he said that last part.\n\n“Listen man,” Dave started, waiting for the next bullet to come, when it didn’t, he plowed on, “please don’t kill me, you’ve made your point, seriously, please, I promise, give me the day and I won’t even leave my house that day, I’ll go to a different state, please man.”\n\n“I always wondered what the begging would be, I have to be honest. Well, in most of my fantasies you’d already done it when I killed you. Before I had the chance, you drank yourself to death. I was the only one to come to your funeral. Even your own mother didn’t bother to show. No flowers, no mourners, just a man the funeral home let piss on your corpse once they knew who you were. But that wasn’t enough. \n\n“I do like that you never promised to stop drinking, and why would you? I have no proof with me that you did anything. Even when you did, you drank more, not less. I’m sorry, but that won’t do at all.”\n\n“Come on man,” Dave was getting desperate, “I haven’t even done anything to you yet.”\n\n“From your point of view, I can see how you might think that. But look at it from my perspective, you’ve taken my wife from me once and even breaking the laws of physics can’t bring her back to me, really. So you’ve fucked me twice. I’m not saying what I’m going to do to you is moral, I’m saying it’s going to happen.”\n\n“They won’t find me for days, not in this neighborhood,” Dave was now crying as he spoke, “Your alibi won’t hold up.”\n\n“I appreciate your concern Dave,” the man said, dripping with sarcasm, “but I already have that figured out. Your neighbor’s phone is close enough to the window that I can use it without going in, just breaking a window, reaching in and calling the police. Now, saying there was a shooting won’t do much. But, saying that there is a bomb in your house, that’ll get the whole station out here, even in this neighborhood. They’ll find you, still bleeding on the floor and I will be far, far away. Both of me will.”\nDave thought about charging him, trying for the gun, but before he could formulate a plan, the gun went off in rapid succession and the man calmly strolled out the door as everything faded to black.\n",

    "passage": "No More Than More\n\n\n\n\nNo More Than Four\n\nCharlie Sacks was as sick as they come. He had taken to bed nearly three days ago and didn't say a word about it. The housemaid Martha waited on him hour to hour, pleasing him with an assortment of soups and teas. He took it presently and surprisingly enough, never did he miss a meal. While his stomach may have been in good order, the ailment seemed to lie in his nasal cavity. The man suffered from a clogged nasal chimney, due to a snot and spit build up, resulting in a whooping fever! Charlie, as a sturdy grown man, knew the only true remedy was a pampering spa and a warm bed. Martha had prepared a bath and Mr. Sacks found comfort in its bubbly waters. From the womb to the sack he did leap. Leaving the bath only to flounder back into bed. The fluffed feathers of his nest proved the greatest comforter, for it was in it's billows he could delve into the latest issue of StarExplorer in peace. \n\nAlas, here is where I found him. A boy in his castle. With three loud knocks on their oakwood door, I made my presence known. Martha greeted me as I leaned against my wooden cane. \n\n\"Evening sir, mighty dark and rainy out there, what can I do for you?\" \n\n\"I be but a humble traveller mum, on the eternal road, I come to beg you for bread.\" \n\n\"From where do you come, Traveller?\"\n\n\"From the land beyond our own! Past the light and through the stone! In the forest, birds have flown, into the greatest deep unknown!\"\n\n\"Where is that exactly?\"\n\n\"Delaware, ma'am\"\n\n\"Please step into the light, so I may gaze your face.\"\n\nIndeed I followed her request and exposed myself to her. Every griping part of me. She no doubt reacted to my lame eye. The haggard mess of scarred skin will cause a double glance from anyone. I stood there, with the porch light bouncing off my darkened cloak, giving the softest exposure to my grey locks and twisted jaw. I knew I was something she had never seen before.\n\n\"Well, no sense having you out there, I invite you in for warmth and bread. Shall we?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ma'am\"\n\n\"Dearie, call me Martha\"\n\n\"Certainly\" \n\nAt once, she invited me into the library, where I sat by the fire and indulged a few lines from a StarExplorer magazine. She was off into the kitchen to prepare me some bread and a bowl of something or other. The library was dark and civil. I admired the eclectic collection of novels and memoirs, as well as the embroidered chair in which I was placed. The leather had taken the shape of my body and I felt for a moment a grace of rest. \n\n\"You're meal, sir\"\n\n\"Remarkable, Martha, you were able to put all that together in the short time I was here?\"\n\n\"No sir, I happen to be mending another weary soul.\"\n\n\"There is another in this house?\"\n\n\"Yes, the owner of the estate, Master Charlie Sacks.\" \n\n\"Whatever is wrong with the poor devil?\"\n\n\"Doctor says it's a nasal buildup, sounds awful, like a dying rodent at times\"\n\n\"Martha, would I be able to speak with Master Sacks? I feel I have a remedy in my possession that he would find most intriguing.\"\n\nThree flights of stairs we took, all winding and weaving through the museum of his halls. From floor to floor, the walls displayed paintings from eras I had yet to see. I felt compelled to ask what Martha made of it.\n\n\"Paintings\", I remarked.\n\n\"Oh yes, the Master collects. He has gone all over the world to find these paintings. Some he had to risk life and limb for. The floor below us holds the ones with pretty ships in them. Ships at port saying goodbye to the folk waving on the dock. Ships battling the raging squalls of the open sea. Ships a plenty. The floor we're on now will have your bones shivering.\"\n\n\"Ma,am?\" \n\n\"This is his gothic collection. Everyone from Dorian Grey to The Oval Portrait hangs here. Let's just say we scurry past this part. Shall we?\"\n\nI could see her distress. For most of the men and women that hung here were depicted in death. My good eye gazed on scenes of immurement, bloodied ruins of genocide and twisted feasts of cannibalism. I shuddered as I glimpsed a familiar face burning in the fires of a witch hunt. \n\nThe last floor presented a welcomed change in the form of landscapes. As we crossed the hall to Sacks bedroom, I was treated to views of mountain ranges and auburn fields of apples. \n\nMartha gently opened the door and announced us to the figure laying in bed.\n\n\"Master Sacks, we have Mr…\"\n\n\"Crypt, Ernie Crypt. Master Sacks, I've come seeking shelter from the storm. As it turns out I found a little bit more. I heard of your ailment and I have a remedy that can promise you better. A rare chance for me to pay back such a hospitable welcome.\"\n\nThe silence made me wonder if he was resting eternally. At last he spoke, \"Bring it to me and leave it on my nightstand.\"\n\nWith a nod to Martha I lurched over to his bedside and from my cloak retrieved a sack of cherry tomatoes. \n\n\"These are picked from a place I doubt even you've been, Mister Sacks. Please I will leave the bag here, but I warn you, only four tomatoes shall you eat before sunrise. Any more, will have you. Indeed, save them for tomorrows light.\"\n\n\"Tomatoes? Is this a folly?\"\n\n\"None, sir, trust me. You will be surprised by natures touch.\"\n\n\"Very well then, be gone with you.\"\n\nAs I exited to the hallway, I left him with four words of remembrance.\n\n\"No more than four\".\n\nMartha allowed me to finish my meal and then filled my canteen with water, gave me a dry towel and then saw me on my way. I was eager to go, not because I held distaste for Martha's company, but because I knew sunrise would be here in a matter of hours and I wanted a good distance behind me when it came.\n\nWithin an hour, Master Sacks gave in to my gesture. Two tomatoes he took at first reach. He was surprised to find that he was soon sitting up and stretching his arms to and fro. He thought better then to over do it, so he settled back in with his magazine. A few more hours past and still the nagging taste of a tomato sat on his tongue. He had never tasted one so rich and rationed that he would still be under his four tomato limit. He settled that he deserved one more at least. The third one was in his mouth in a flash and the result was so tremendous that he threw the covers onto the floor and wreathed around his bedsheets stretching and yawning. The slumber was fading behind him and he soon felt fit to stand up. Yet something stayed him. He was thinking of his knowledge of medicine.\n\n\"My doctor always said, finish the bottle or it won't work.\" He reasoned quietly.\n\nBy the time he was chewing his fourth tomato, Sacks was walking down the hall to fetch a cup of milk. \n\n\"Heavens, sir, a change of winds?\" Martha gasped as Sacks entered the kitchen.\n\n\"Martha it seems our weary traveller spoke truth. Those tomatoes did a wonder on my senses. I feel fit enough to read in the dignity of my own library. First, I shall like a glass of milk.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir, I'll bring it right in.\"\n\nMaster Sack's toes wiggled around the fire heat as he sunk into his chair. A few adjustments were made until he felt the familiar shape again. Martha came in and left a tall glass of milk on the table beside him. She left him to read StarExplorer. A wonderful serial involving flying machines in space and men with laser guns finding lost princesses. The adventure had pulled him in for nearly an hour when he was distracted to see, inside the pocket of his house coat, the sack of tomatoes. \n\n\"A wonder.\" he thought.\n\nAs he continued to read, he thumbed the ripe, round tomatoes almost unaware of his habit. It took only a few minutes before another tomato was out of the sack and into his mouth. Half expecting to feel superhuman, Sacks was distraught to find that a cold chill instantly cascaded through his bones. The impact caused him to drop his magazine onto the floor. As he reached down to pick it up, a searing pain shot through his lower back. He tried to scream, but only gasped, for his breath was failing him. Sweat was accumulating and as he wiped his brow he felt only wrinkles of elderly skin. He willed himself a sip of milk. When he lay the glass back on the table he saw a line of red smearing down the side of the glass. Could his mouth be bleeding? He flustered over to the mirror to inspect. Yet the startling sight of his ghost and the ripe taste of tomato stopped him. A vision of auburn apple fields and infinite galaxies filled his eyes. Master Sacks fell to the floor. The old boy was dead.\n\nNo doubt Martha discovered him within the hour. Her shriek would be heard by no one. For the estate stands miles from anyone wishing to hear. No doubt she would take to the door to look for the strange traveller who had seemingly betrayed them. Yet she would not find him, only a discarded cane. For a cane is used by lame eyed old gypsies, not those who ride with fresh eyes into the eternal sunrise.   \n\nend.",

    "passage": "[Behind the scenes of this morning’s 'behind-the-scenes' stories about Obama’s surge deliberations. | White House Photo]\n\nPresident Barack Obama holds a meeting on Afghanistan in the Situation Room of the White House. | White House\n\nA long reconstruction of President Barack Obama’s Afghanistan “surge” deliberations, splashed on the front page of Friday’s Los Angeles Times, featured the sort of journalistic candy that is the rarest treat on the White House beat: a behind-the-scenes anecdote (from the Situation Room, no less) – with an actual quote from the president.\n\n“To emphasize his desire to speed up the deployment, the president held up a printout copy of the bell curve [a graph projecting a troop buildup over time] and pointed to its apex, indicating the peak of the flow,” the article says, then quotes “one official” as reporting that the president said: “I want to move this to the left. … We need more troops in sooner.”\n\nThe front page of Sunday’s New York Times features a much longer reconstruction of Obama’s Afghanistan deliberations, with the same Veterans Day scene and (nearly) the same quote: “‘I want this pushed to the left,’ he told advisers, pointing to the bell curve. In other words, the troops should be in sooner, then out sooner.”\n\nThe tidbit neatly serves both the press and the White House: The reporters appear to be getting a juicy scoop – the sort of take-you-there detail that might turn up in a Bob Woodward book years after the fact. And the president’s aides are dishing an irresistible illustration of a take-charge president’s proactive approach to his decision to commit 30,000 more troops to a war that has begun to look like a quagmire.\n\nThis type of story – known in the trade as a “tick-tock,” for its heavy reliance on chronology – has become de rigueur for the big papers in the days after a major Washington event. Sunday’s Washington Post also has an Afghanistan tick-tock that posted on the web Saturday afternoon, five minutes after The New York Times’ opus. The L.A. editors rushed the piece into type after a sit-down White House briefing on Thursday, knowing that competitors were working on their own versions.\n\nThe White House gets a “mission accomplished” grade for all three stories, each of which amplifies the West Wing’s desired storyline: A smart, probing president cuts through the fog of competing visions to come up with his own unique version of a surge — the in-and-out version that he announced at West Point on Tuesday night. \n\nThe implicit message of the material fed to the three papers: This was not just a Potemkin debate over a foregone conclusion. Unlike President George W. Bush, we took a long, hard look at the options and alternatives. And unlike the armchair warriors in the Bush administration, we didn’t let ideology drive strategy. This president knows the cost of war, and wasn’t taking the troop commitment lightly. \n\n“Inside the Situation Room: How a War Plan Evolved” is the dramatic, two-column headline of Sunday’s New York Times, with the article spread over two ad-free pages inside.\n\nThe White House Press Office (sorry, no Deep Throat) coordinated a series of tick-tock briefings for individual reporters with top players late last week, explaining the similarity in themes and color among the pieces.\n\nObama aides pushed — “shopped,” as reporters cynically put it — to multiple reporters a description of a chastened president returning to his deliberations after a visit to Arlington National Cemetery. One reporter, who had resisted the description as too pat, was amused to find it as the lead of The New York Times account.\n\nWhite House officials were most delighted by The New York Times story, both because it emphasized their desired themes and “moments,” and because it was the most thorough. The Times story was written by Peter Baker, with feeds from 10 other well-sourced reporters in the paper’s Washington Bureau.\n\nThe Washington Post had three bylines (Anne E. Kornblut, Scott Wilson and Karen DeYoung and credited two other reporters and a researcher. The L.A. Times version is the most spare -- 1,600 words, compared with 4,500 for The New York Times and 3,330 for The Post -- and carried two bylines (Christi Parsons and Julian E. Barnes), with a credit for one other journalist.\n\nThe Post lacks visibility into the thinking of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, an essential player in the deliberations. The New York Times, which Obama reads, got by far the most access. One official who gave tick-tock briefings said he took The Times the most seriously, and was pleased with the result. “It’s the one to stick in the time capsule,” the official said.\n\nA former New York Times editor who helped pioneer the format recalled in an e-mail how the tick-tock became so popular with the paper’s brass: “We realized forcefully that on Sundays we could cream the newsweeklies' inevitable Monday cover stories, and we delighted in doing it. In general terms, the form developed as an antidote to the hyping of minor spot developments to look like big news, and thereby fill out the front page on mostly news-free Sundays.”\n\nWhite Houses quickly learn to exploit this hunger, and serve up details that bolster the message they’re trying to send. In Bush’s first term, both The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post became suspicious of his aides’ string of accounts of how detail-oriented and take-charge Bush was behind the scenes, and pulled back from writing tick-tocks that relied too heavily on White House anecdotes that could not be verified.\n\nNone of the Obama accounts is hostile – all of them hew, more or less, to the line that Obama took his time to make a difficult decision that reflected his priorities and a rigorous internal debate. The Los Angeles Times story reflects that favorable narrative most exactly.\n\nThe New York Times and Post are slightly more critical, for different reasons. Baker makes it implicitly clear just how divided the Team of Rivals was. But he closes by emphasizing consensus and the president's serenity in his decision. In the Post's narrative – which starts with an annoyed POTUS telling his advisers he feels less-than-usually “sedate” about the need to speed up the war plan -- Obama comes off as a more impatient leader, and his lack of enthusiasm for a no-holds-barred war plan seems to receive greater attention. \n\nThe Post and, to a lesser extent, The New York Times indicate that the administration had to navigate serious civilian-military tensions as Obama shaped his strategy. In Baker's narrative, the leaks of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's initial report on troops and Ambassador Karl Eikenberry's memo recommending against a surge represented the most explosive conflicts between uniformed and civilian staff. But in The Post's telling, there are hints of a more basic level of misunderstanding between an administration that didn't quite grasp how to talk to military leaders\n\nOnly the Los Angeles Times hints at the political considerations that were on the minds of some advisers. And none of the stories discerns what sort of internal disagreement about the war may persist.\n\nEach of the three Obama tick-tocks contains buzzy morsels. Here are some key passages:\n\n--N.Y. Times: Vice President Joe Biden “quickly became the most outspoken critic of the expected McChrystal troop request, arguing that Pakistan was the bigger priority, since that is where Al Qaeda is mainly based. ‘He was the bull in the china shop,’ said one admiring administration official. But others were nodding their heads at some of what he was saying, too, including General Jones and Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.”\n\n--N.Y. Times: “Mr. Obama had read ‘Lessons in Disaster,’ Gordon M. Goldstein’s book on the Vietnam War. The book had become a must read in the West Wing after Mr. Emanuel had dinner over the summer at the house of another deputy national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, and wandered into his library to ask what he should be reading. Among the conclusions that Mr. Donilon and the White House team drew from the book was that both President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson failed to question the underlying assumption about monolithic Communism and the domino theory — clearly driving the Obama advisers to rethink the nature of Al Qaeda and the Taliban.”\n\n--N.Y. Times: “After a meeting where the Pentagon made a presentation with impressive color-coded maps, Mrs. Clinton returned to the State Department and told her aides, ‘We need maps,’ as one recalled. She was overseas during the next meeting on Oct. 14, when aides used her new maps to show civilian efforts but she participated with headphones on from her government plane flying back from Russia.”\n\n--N.Y. Times: Defense Secretary Robert “Gates’s low-wattage exterior masks a wily inside player, and he knew enough to keep his counsel early in the process to let it play out more first.”\n\n--Washington Post: “‘What was interesting was the metamorphosis,’ said national security adviser James L. Jones, the only senior official who agreed to discuss the deliberations on the record. ‘I dare say that none of us ended up where we started.’”\n\n--L.A. Times: “The president wanted to know when the effects of the new strategy would become apparent, based on an ongoing Pentagon analysis of its own plans. ‘When will we know that our concept is working?’ Obama asked, recalled one official who was present. ‘Our best sense,’ replied Gates, ‘will be in late 2010 and into mid-2011.’”\n\n_Mr. Allen and Mr. Burns reported from Arlington, Va., with kibitzing by John F. Harris in Alexandria, Va., Jim VandeHei in Falls Church, Va., Ben Smith in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Jonathan Martin in Omaha, Neb., and with assistance from several senior administration officials who demanded anonymity in order to discuss the reporters and institutions who will be covering their boss for the next three to seven years._\n",

    "passage": "[RF] Would You Mind if I Hurt You?\n\n* blood and sexual references warning- first time poster, any tips appreciated.\n\nDespite her tendencies, cherry red was not Laura King’s favorite color. She actually enjoyed the washed out white color of a bride’s dress worn after years of happy marriage. It was like a dirty pearl white that still managed to maintain its purity and air of innocence that came with the type of clothing it was associated with. Laura always found red too demanding of a color. It craved attention with it’s bright hues or gave the impression of hate with it’s dark tones. White was a happy color. Who didn't like white?\nThe needle was sliding between her fingers again. The blood, mostly wet on her fingers, reached down just past her wrists and sprayed across her hands like ribbons of color. She wiped them on her shirt again so she could hold the needle properly. She threaded tighter, pulling the cold, dead pink lips of Charlotte Audley together in beautiful silence. Nobody needed to hear that horrible voice. Even in the afterlife.\nIt took longer than usual for Laura to dye Charlotte’s dreadful knotted hair into a beautiful auburn. Her nails had the dye stuck under them because her hair was so messy. But once dried, brushed, and straightened, she was amazingly pretty. She also decided to take extra care to french braid Charlotte’s hair, putting in those pretty daisies of her favorite color between strands. She looked fresh and young, no longer delinquent and juvenile. Bleaching those ugly tattoos away from Charlotte’s skin refreshed her appearance. No longer was she stained red with dark skulls on her thigh or those ragged letters across her neck. Instead, Laura gave her a sweet little tattoo of a black star on the skin between her thumb and her index finger, trying to make it seem sentimental. Maybe she had received it from a lover whom she could never see again for various reasons. It was tragic, romantic.\nChoosing clothes was easy this time. Ditch the motor jacket, leather finger-less gloves and worn jeans. She choose a warm-toned sundress with vivid colors and no sleeves. It was more expensive than most outfits she chose for her dolls-not victims, she reminded herself-and didn't suit the current weather. It had been raining a lot recently. Only from what Laura noticed though, because when she did go outside, it was for this.\nShe kept the makeup light, making her pale skin tone more flattering and brightening up the contrast on the dead girl’s face. She gave her a gold wedding band but left it on the girl’s thick pinky, almost to show not quite commitment. No more jewelry though, not for this one. Earrings especially would ruin the feel she was trying to give off this girl.\n\nThe next day, she would wake in her dark apartment early enough to see the morning news. Laura always kept the remote under her pillow next to her small pistol. It was a predictable headline; “local girl found dead in park overnight-” and again they called her what she wasn't. “Serial killer.” It was such a harsh title that forbade so many things, but Laura was none of them. She was simply an artist. God’s little paintbrush sent down to fix his crooked paintings.\n“The doll-maker.” It wasn't a very creative criminal title to say the least. At least they were right about the doll part. They zoomed in again on sweet petite Charlotte’s dead face, and an icy smile crept across Laura’s lips. She was so beautiful now. God would cherish her beauty in heaven. \nLaura’s morning was unexciting. She worked at home doing various minor programming jobs and web coding more often. She picked her own hours and her own jobs and the money was good because of her talent. She had many more, unknown to her clients. It was another easy morning of walking around in a tank top and underwear, going between eating cereal and toast, then showering late into her work as a break. \nBut the highlight of her day would be walking down at exactly 2:30 pm to the coffee shop across the street, sitting in the quiet corner near the cobweb nobody wanted to take, and ordering from the same raven-haired waiter that worked there every weekday. He was very beautiful. He had dark, frustrated hair that cried out to be tamed. It was short but shaggy and fell to the back of his neck. It curled at the tips like burnt pages. \nHe had exhilarating eyes. Despite his quiet nature and seemingly darker personality, they were a bright green like an elixir brewed expertly by an apothecary. If such, they certainly left a spell on her. His lips were a pale pink, scarred by a silver ring embedded into his taunting lower lip. She could write about him for days, despite not knowing him. Today he smelled like the mocha they brewed in the shop, and his voice was the smooth greeting as always.\n“Oh. Hello again. What can I get you?”\n*I would love a bite of you, my raven.* “I've been dying for a cinnabon if you don’t mind.”\n“Unusual for you.” He bit his lip, but accepted it and walked away.\nHe knew her, and she knew him, but they didn't really *know* each other.\n\n*Aphrodite* was a fairly popular standalone nightclub. It was the only one in the whole city, so at night the lines were long and the lights produced mimicked daylight- if daylight was the whole rainbow spectrum. Laura was best friends (quote unquote) with the assistant manager, so she had her free pass in whenever she wanted and drinks on his tab. She generally paid him in casual sex, and she’d be surprised if he remembered half their nights together in his drunken stupor.\nIt was easiest to find those who needed her special skills in a place like this. Intoxicated people were generally vulnerable and weak to withhold. She helped the rebels settle down and the wallflowers show their true colors- but only to god. As if other regular people could recognize her art anyway. The seven sins danced along the crowd, most in human form. It was a beautifully horrific sight.\nToday she reserved herself to the bar. She had her taste of blood for this week, and didn't have the supplies to make another doll. Maybe Todd would treat her to his cock once his shift ended. She wasn't busy tonight, so she wouldn't mind. He was an aggressive lover. Maybe he was withholding a dominatrix behind his glassy emeralds. It was a prison she was okay being withheld in- temporarily. Truly, only her raven could make her shiver and aware with his presence.\n“I didn’t take you for a bar girl.”\nShe froze. Her mind scattered. She forced a smile, spinning towards the voice on her stool.\n“I didn’t take you for a clubber.” she clipped to her raven haired coffee shop boy.\n“I’m not. But I could use some scotch tonight.” His order to the bartender came swiftly afterwards, and he downed it like he needed it to survive.\n“What ails you, Gabriel?” his name slid off her her tongue like warm melted chocolate over her lips. “A woman done wronged you?”\n“I’ve been going crazy over those murders on TV.” Her breath caught on the last word, and she nearly choked on her mojito. He didn’t seem to notice, and she remained calm. She slid her elbow over the counter, resting her face on her fist. Laura’s grey eyes fluttered with the movement of her erratic eyelashes.\n“What about? It’s just some psycho like the police are talking about. They’ll figure it out. They profile them and stuff.”\nHe cleared his throat. “I think...I think it’s more than that.” She dug her nails into her palm. She cocked her head to the side in question. “You see, the police think this person is just killing for sport,” he continued. “But I think there’s something more sinister than that, Laura.”\nShe licked her lips. “Are you saying this killer has a motive? Getting back at someone?” She was desperate to change the topic. She didn’t like her raven’s wings clipped by her own intentions.\n“No. I think...they create these women as they are...because they want to be like them.” Anger blossomed in her chest. Denial. Her heart rate shot, and the corner of her lips twitched.\n“Maybe you’re wrong…” *...about me.* She bit off the last part. She ran a hand through her lengthy brown hair, pushing it to one side so she could look at him more clearly. \n“This killer is jealous. They change these women so that they think that’s the best way those women can be. But they’re wrong. These women are just fine...it’s this killer that is off. They can’t accept themselves for what they are. They-”\n“You’re wrong!” She cut him off. She spun her stool, standing up abruptly as her shawl flew around her. Her half-empty glass of mojito rattled on the counter and Gabriel looked at her in shock. She looked at him for a brief moment with a fire in her eyes that would be normally taken as passion, but it was so much more in depth than that. “You’re wrong and I’m going to prove it to you.” With that, she pushed back the crowd and stormed out of the bar.\n\nWho was her raven to judge her? She was not jealous of these hideous women. She *fixed* them. Almost like showing their true colors, exposing the potential they had to be- only the convinced them post mortem. She knew she had to make her point. Fine- he wanted to see what she saw in her dolls? He would fucking see it. She did it only because he was so beautiful...and he had to understand.\nThe painkillers took a half hour for their full effect. Her canvas was less controlled today, but she supposed it didn’t matter since she would never use one like this again. She was much shakier with the needles today, and despite the medication she had trouble going on...but it was for her raven. He needed to understand how to fly. She could teach the women, but she couldn’t teach her sweet, innocent raven.\nSometimes, sacrifices had to be made for perfection to be achieved.\n\nIn the end, she never finished her final masterpiece. In the morning, Gabriel would walk out of his apartment complex to put out the garbage like he did most weekends. Everything was usual, except for the massacre of his coffee shop girl. He would find Laura King against a wall on a Saturday morning, cold, dead, and covered in blood. He would find her sitting against it, her right wrist nailed to the stone wall and the hammer in her left hand. Her lips were sewn together, blood dribbling from their sides. Her previously fiery eyes were cold and reflecting the morning sunlight in their glassy state. She was wearing white, all white, from her dress to her jewelry to her gloves. Blood splattered across her clothing, in intricate patterns almost as if she planned them. He would drop the white rose he was meant to give her in the coffee shop that day that she would never knew about.\nBut what was important to the image of the girl who fixed herself, was the dripping blood painted on the wall behind her in the form of two large glorious angel wings.\n     \n\n ",

    "passage": "Devereux Glenholme School\n\nTHE GLENHOLME SCHOOL, also known as DEVEREUX GLENHOLME SCHOOL, is an independent coeducational therapeutic boarding school situated on over in Washington, Connecticut. The school aims to provide a highly structured environment for children ages 10 to 21 who face challenges from various conditions, including high functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and Asperger syndrome; ADHD, OCD, Tourette syndrome, depression, anxiety, and emotional and learning disabilities.\n\n\nProgram\n\nServices include a comprehensive academic curriculum, sports, fine arts, and an emphasis on community service. The program includes residential treatment, day treatment, summer program and post-secondary college and transitional living services.\n\nThe school's milieu therapy is intended to address varying levels of academic, social and special needs development for boys and girls ages 10 to 21. Glenholme aims to prepare graduates for higher education and post-secondary career opportunities.\n\n\nFaculty\n\nThe school has 1 psychiatrist, 1 psychologist, 7 clinicians, 34 boarding instructors, and 28 education faculty including teachers, aides, and special programs. All teachers are either certified in Special Education in Connecticut or are content-area certified in Connecticut. While the student-to-staff ratio is 10:1:1, the student-to-on-duty staff ratio is considerably lower.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDevereux Glenholme was established in 1968[1] on the country estate of the Van Sinderen family, which had been donated to the Devereux Foundation by Jean White Van Sinderen, who had learned of the work of special education pioneer Helena T. Devereux and desired to create a school where children with special behavioral and learning needs could develop their potential.[2] The school's administrative offices are in a colonial revival house originally called Glen Holme, designed by architect Ehrick Rossiter for industrialist William Leslie Van Sinderen (1856–1909) and completed in 1898.[3]\n\nIn subsequent years the school was supported by Mrs. Van Sinderen's son, Alfred W. Van Sinderen, one-time Chief Executive Officer of Southern New England Telephone Company who died in 1998.[4]\n\n\nAccreditation and affiliations\n\nGlenholme is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.[5] It also is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools and the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools and holds approvals from the California Department of Education, Los Angeles Unified School District, Connecticut Department of Children and Families, Connecticut Department of Education, District of Columbia Department of Education, Massachusetts Department of Education, New Jersey Department of Education, Illinois Department of Education, and New York Department of Education.[6]\n\n\nInnovative programs\n\nDuring the 1990s, Devereux Glenholme was successful in instituting staff training that resulted in significant reductions in its use of physical restraints and time-outs, in spite of an increase in the severity of behavioral symptoms among its students. More recently, the school participated in a project supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration aimed at further reducing the use of restraints and seclusion in residential behavioral health care settings.[7] The Communities of Character program for character education was developed by Devereux Glenholme, as the first school to bring the effort of positive school climate and character education to Connecticut in the mid-90s.[8][9]\n\n\nIn the news\n\nThe school frequently enlists celebrities to assist in fundraising, thus garnering publicity.\n\nIn May 2009, the school received media attention when it broke ground for a new arts center and held an auction fundraiser with the support of James Marsden and Jessica Biel.[10]\n\nIn August 2010, special culinary guests Johnny Iuzinni, of Bravo TV's _Top Chef_, and David Arnold, director of the French Culinary Institute's technology department, shared their passion for science and the culinary craft to concoct several out-of-this-world creations for the culinary connoisseurs at Glenholme.[11]\n\nIn May 2011 comedians Jim Carrey and Tracy Morgan participated in the school's annual Parents' Weekend and the opening events for the school's Center for the Arts.[12]\n\nIn 2012, Glenholme culinary students enjoyed a private demonstration and hands-on lesson with chef Barbara Lynch of Barbara Lynch Gruppo (formerly No. 9 Group).[13]\n\nIn 2012, David O. Russell publicly supported the school's fundraising efforts while promoting his movie, _Silver Linings Playbook_.[14][15] _Vanity Fair_, Barneys New York and Weinstein Co. celebrated _Silver Linings Playbook_ in support of the Glenholme School on Wednesday February 20, 2013 as part of pre-Oscar week in Los Angeles.[16][17] Russell and _Parenthood_ producer Jason Katims assisted in another New York City Fundraiser to benefit the school's scholarship fund in October 2013, enlisting the support of actress Natalie Dormer.[18]\n\nIn 2015, Russell enlisted numerous celebrities to support the school's fifth New York City fundraiser. Guests included Robert De Niro, Grace Hightower, Harvey Weinstein, Dascha Polanco, Cristin Milioti and Isabella Rossellini.[19]\n\nRussell and Dascha Polanco returned to Glenholme's New York City fundraiser in 2016 to support the cause and honor Joe Hall, President of Ghetto Film School.[20][21] Glenholme also receives local media attention for campus activities including annual events such as Grandparents' Day,[22] Alumni Day,[23] Boarding Recognition Week,[24] Canine Collection,[25] guest presenters including Ally Del Monte, who spoke with students about bullying in October 2015,[26] and Krista Weltner, who discussed harnessing the strength of her learning disability to complete an MFA in the Puppet Arts Program at the University of Connecticut,[27] as well as various community service efforts including a fundraiser by the school's culinary program,[28] traditional food drives,[29] promoting tourism and the arts,[30] and the honoring of American heroes in conjunction with Wreaths Across America every December.[31][32][33] In recent years, the school generated awareness and community spirit with a 5K Run for Autism.[34][35] In 2016, the school's annual autism run continued to generate awareness.[36][37]\n\nIn 2017, Glenhole became the subject of a child abuse sex scandal dating to 2001.[38] A fifteen-year-old male was forced into a sexual relationship with an older female staff member. When the student reported the crime, Judith Cooper, the executive administrator, denied the affair and took no measures to protect the student. The student's parents eventually removed him and have sued the school.\n\nIn June 2018, Glenholme celebrated 50 years as a special needs boarding school with a jubilee gala. Filmmaker David O. Russell and _Good Morning America_’s Robin Roberts hosted the evening gala.

    "passage": "Cartoons have existed for a long time to make you happy.  Even when Bugs Bunny was fighting Hitler, they were still generally designed to put a big old smile on your face or at the very least, let you zone out over a bowl of cheerios on a Saturday morning. For some reason, Avatar: The Last Airbender decided to come around and upset that comfortably numbing cartoon experience (thank you, Mike and Bryan. I hate/love you forever). For every couple of silly moments of Aang riding some new hybrid beast or a kick-ass action sequences, there’s a truly touching or heartbreaking scene that has us fans bending the tears right out of our eyeballs. Seriously, thank god I saw this show when I was basically an adult because while I was barely able to handle all the feelings at 18, I can’t imagine how a 12 year-old would cope. Anyway, if you’re in the mood for some punishment, take a gander at the list below.\n\n\n10) KATARA GROSSES US OUT WITH SOME BLOOD-BENDING.\n\n\n[]\n\nWhen the leader of your team is an adorably pure child-monk, it’s hard to consider yourself a champion of goodness. However, as far a morally righteous characters go, Katara is pretty up there. That’s why it was so emotionally trying to watch her battle with her own demons and unethically awesome power of blood-bending.\n\nThis wasn’t the last time we’d see the issue of benders subjugating their will upon non-benders(*cough*  Legend of Korra *cough*), but we were right with Katara’s ultimate conflict between stopping the vengeful Hama and using a forbidden art.\n\nPlus, how disgusting is the sound effect used for blood-bending? I want to hurl-bend every time that I hear it.\n\n\n9) AANG FINDS GYATSO SLIGHTLY…DEAD.\n\n[]\n\nAfter 100 years of war, I think it can be generally summed up that Aang’ abandonment of his Avatar duties was largely a bad move. However, he really was just a scared kid so we forgive him. Besides, the little monk probably had a harder time of forgiving himself.\n\nWhile Aang remained in pretty good spirits after waking up from his ice ball, perhaps he did not realize the consequences of a world without an Avatar fully until finding the long dead skeleton of his friend and mentor, Air Nomad Gyatso. The Southern Air Temple was destroyed in the Fire Nation’s pursuit of total domination and Aang’s consuming grief over their loss was enough to bring us all to tears.\n\nUltimately, Gyatso’s death was just another mark on Aang’s path to a fully realized Avatar and he was able to let go of his grief with the help of Pathik. Still, our hearts go out to the little dude who will always consider his greatest weaknesses to be those moments when he fails to save a friend’s life.\n\n\n8)ZUKO’S VERY FIRST AGNI KAI AND BANISHMENT FROM THE FIRE NATION\n\n[]\n\nAt the beginning of Avatar, Zuko was just the angry dude with the scar and top-knot who happened to be on a relentless quest to find the Avatar. We didn’t like him, but we also didn’t know much about him. Well turns out, his dick-wad father punched him, scarred him, and then banished him for daring to speak out against irresponsible actions of his generals and then refusing to fight his father in an Agni Kai.\n\nThis back story gave incredible depth to our favorite prickly prince, whose pursuit of the Avatar became an obsession of a hurt boy whose concepts of family, duty, and honor were completely warped. Plus, we learned that his face wasn’t actually always permanently frozen in that terrifying scowl. We maybe still didn’t outright _like_ Zuko after this flashback (He was still imperialistic and ruthless fire nation after all) but at least now we knew he was a human being and not just an evil bratty prince Joffrey( I don’t know how to help people who don’t know their Game of Thrones. I really don’t).\n\n7)APPA GETS KIDNAPPED AND NOBODY CARES\n\n[]\n\nAs if losing Appa wasn’t emotional enough, we then get to witness the normally very cool and calm Aang flip the flip out when none of the gaang seems to care very much. He first freaks out on Toph accusing her of never caring for the fuzzy air bison and then rails on the group for only lamenting on losing their designated driver. Not only does an angry Aang make me want to go cuddle in a corner somewhere, we also get a touching picture of how close Aang and Appa are. He’s not his pet, he’s his best friend, and in that instant, his new chums weren’t looking all that good or worth the hassle. It arrives at a conflict every Avatar must deal with: how much should they sacrifice for an undeserving and selfish world? All I have to say is that thank Agni Appa returns.\n\n6) ZUKO’S SECOND AGNI KAI VERSUS AZULA.\n\n[]\n\nThe last few episodes of The Last Airbender were like a kick to all the major organs. While Aang was busy triumphing over the Phoenix King, Zuko faced his own battle against his sister, Azula. Not only was the fight scenes amazing, but we get to see Zuko finally battle his own inner demons (as well as the outer, Azula), but we see Katara entering the fray in defense of her former enemy.\n\nPlus, Zuko masters the art of channeling lightening and symbolically becomes the man his uncle believes he could have always been. As fun as it was to see Zuko finally kick the snot out of that…well, bitch, in the end I still felt for her in that any descent in to madness is pretty hard to stomach.\n\n5) IT’S NOT YOU, IT’S JUST THAT I HAVE TO GO BE THE MOON.\n\n[]\n\nNormally our big gift of comedic relief, this is Sokka’s first appearance on the list. It’s got to be rough when not only does your first girlfriend’s family consider you pond scum but she is also the moon spirit. Basically, the universe decided that it was wrong for Aang to be the only one to sacrifice things to save the world, so it decided to take a shot at Sokka next. While Sokka remains disturbed by losing Yue or failing to protect her, I honestly can’t say that I cry for him too much since warrior bad-ass Suki is a much funner love interest for our boomerang wielding-water-tribesmen. Still, it sucked for Sokka.\n\n4)THE FIRE NATION CLUB\n\n[]Ok, so I have mixed feelings about this episode. On one hand the Azula beach party was a fun time, but it was also bit of a complaint fest. Ultimately though, even if you’re incapable of feeling truly bad for a bunch of spoiled teenagers who spend their time trying to kill our heroes, you can at least sympathize with their situation. These are really just kids who, like the Gaang, are given heavy responsibilities way beyond their years.\n\nIn the face of their waning childhoods, they look back and realize they never had much of one in the first place. What was supposed to be a few moments of respite turns in to the interlude that prepares us for the final battles. In the end, these teens will have to make choices that will either forsake their family, duty, or sense of righteousness, and this short confessional on the beach gives us a chance to still like these characters for their small display of humanity after the bloody conclusion to come.\n\n3)NO BUT REALLY, WHERE IS URSA?\n\n[]\n\nAang defeats the Phoenix King, YAY. Aang get the girl, YAY. Hakoda reunites with his kids, YAY. Iroh opens a tea shop, YAY.\n\nOk but wait, what happened to Ursa, the misplaced Fire Lady and Zuko’s beloved mother? After the incarceration of his father, Fire Lord Zuko demands that Ozai reveal the fate of his mother. Yeah, nothing doing. It was emotional seeing the newly crowned Zuko have to come crawling back to his father for the one power the crippled emperor still possessed, the power to fuck with his son.\n\nAll we really wanted was a scene reuniting mother and son next to a pond of turtle ducks, but Avatar can’t just love its fans like that. Those few who still care about the poor Fire Lady, check out Avatar: The Promise, which continues where Book Three Ended.\n\n2) IROH AND ZUKO REUNITE.\n\n[]\n\nThe relationship between Iroh and his young angry nephew is probably the best on the show. After the death of Iroh’s son and the banishment of Zuko, the young prince and general assume the roles each has lost.\n\nWhile Iroh embraces his new duty as surrogate father to Zuko, the prince decides to just become a giant brat. However, giant brats are a lot more terrifying when backed with an army and royal status. Once stripped of his title and powers, Zuko spends a great deal of Book Two shedding his darkness and becoming closer to his uncle…that is until he betrays him and the Avatar.\n\nUnlike most characters, Zuko is given a second chance at redemption, one that he embraces…for good this time. Despite proving himself to Aang and the resistance, nothing is as difficult for Zuko as asking the forgiveness of the uncle that raised him. In one of the most heart-wrenching moments in the whole series, General Iroh embraces his nephew in a teary hug and admits he was never angry with Zuko, only sad that he had lost his way. Oh. My. God. The. Tears.\n\n1) YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT IS.\n\n[]\n\nIn the most emotionally heart-wrenching moment in cartoon _history,_ Avatar tries to trick you with a fun and light episode of cute vignettes. Just when  you think Tales of Ba Sing Se is fun filler fluff, it hits you with this: The Tale of Iroh.\n\nIn the short segment, Iroh bops around Ba Sing Se like his happy Iroh-self, collecting different objects and getting in mini adventures. You’re right there with the loveable teddy bear until the final scene: his small shrine to his late son, who passed away during the siege of the city years ago. Iroh sings us a song so beautiful, if you don’t cry, you’re just a monster. ( Amonster…not the time for jokes).\n\nNot only is this a touching scene, but we are shown the reason General Iroh stopped fighting and gave up the throne and it is so freaking sad.\n\nIf your heart can stand it, come back later for the most touching moments from Legend of Korra.\n\nFor more avatar fun check out Outfits Inspired by Avatar’s Airbenders!\n",

Small tribal economies based on resource sharing work because of the human relationships between the members of the tribe it is easy to share something with somebody when you see them every day and have family ties to them. Most people would gladly loan their car to their brother for a weekend but if somebody just knocked on your door and asked for your keys I'd bet the answer would be different. History is full of these well meaning movements the moment a caveman traded a shiny rock for a mammoth steak there were other cavemen wanting to know why they didn't have any shiny rocks and why they all couldn't just each have a bite of mammoth steak. It's a nice dream but like all dreams like it the problem is that you are dealing with people and that is where it will fail like all the movements that came before it.\n\n\n#12 2014-03-08 17:14:24\n\nANDORU\n    #!

Therefore to me that means not very regulated or managed which can be a weakness and a strength.\nsome people think of capitalism as a kind of  economic freedom inseparable from democracy.\nIf it is a \"system\" it wasn't designed by anyone. \nI am a bit scared by the idea of \"experts\" desinging a system for the rest of us to live under.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTroll = not a fanatic\nslave of #!  and arch\n\n\n#14 2014-03-08 22:22:25\n\nCLOVERSKULL\n    #! JUNKIE\n    []\n    Registered: 2013-10-26\n    Posts: 377\n\nRe: TZM anyone?\n\nThe big conundrum is objective vs subjective \"value\" - what a 30k/yr salaried person spends $100 on one day can be the same thing that the billionaire spends $100 on, but the subjective value of what the $100 paid for means much more to the less wealthy person. The problem (as I see it) with a purely resources-based system is that there's no significant motivating factor to create, innovate, or otherwise make significant strides toward making things better.\n\nMy personal philosophies would take many paragraphs that I neither feel like writing nor would anyone read. Suffice it to say it makes sense to socialize some things: military, police, government, emergency services, health care, things like that. I also don't feel like true laissez faire capitalism can flourish without exploiting people and/or resources, so I'm a fan of limited government regulation. I just don't think in the past several thousands of years of recorded history, we've come up with much else that is both effective and palatable to a society.\n\n\n#15 2014-03-08 22:44:04\n\nPVSAGE\n    INTERNAL AFFAIRS\n    []\n    From: North Carolina\n    Registered: 2009-10-18\n    Posts: 13,970\n\nRe: TZM anyone?\n\nAs a moderator, I've been trying to stay out of this discussion.\n\n*Moderator removes cadre hat*\nMy main problem with capitalism is that wealth has become the primary reinforcement for any behavior - not survival, not reproduction, not self-fulfillment, but wealth itself.  In a world where personal worth is literally measured by someone's economic value, what is the worth of literature, art, or music created for its own sake?  Rebecca Black's infamous song is almost universally despised, but that doesn't matter because every non-adblocked view of it on Youtube still generates advertising revenue, so from a capitalist perspective she's a success.\n\nEDIT:  That's pretty much all I want to say on this matter, so I'll get off the soapbox and let the rest of you have some fun here, as long as you're respectful of each others' dignity.\n\n_Last edited by pvsage (2014-03-08 23:04:36)_\n\n\n#16 2014-03-08 22:57:30\n\nJOEK\n    #!

    "passage": "Against the Blood Red Sky\n\n            \n       \n  Against  the  blood  red  sky, a lone helicopter\n  hovers around the city looking for any trace of   survivors that might  be below. Down on what used   to be the peaceful city, (now referred to as ground   zero) the horrific cries of death and fear bellow   throughout the city. Never stopping.. Like a record     stuck in a loop. The dead have poured out from the   deepest depths of hell and returned to the living.     Devouring every living soul that they come across.     The city is in ruins. Overturned and abandoned cars     littler the street, buildings turned to ash from the     riots and looting, death and gore fill the streets   turning the once pure black asphalt now to a deep   murky red. Over the pain filled screams of the living   and the mindless groans of the undead, Kenton and   Elizabeth hear a desperate shriek\n from the   helicopter, “Any survivors that can hear me, get to  the roof tops NOW!!” Elizabeth’s  \neyes and face light up with a hopeful glee. “We can   get out!” she exclaimed. “They’re here to save us.”  \n Kenton’s face however, had that horrified look that   had been there since the infection ravished the city.   “Yeah, if we can even make it that far” he silently said to himself.   \n        \n\n      \n     \nKenton gazed around the corner of the hunting \nsupplies shop they had been trying to gain access \nto. “There is an old grocery store about a block from \nhere that they should be able to see us from.” \nKenton said. “I don’t care what it is, as long as we \nget the hell out of here.” Elizabeth murmured. “We’re \ngoing to need guns if we are even going to stand a \nchance at getting over there.” Kenton exclaimed. So, \nKenton pulled the last bobby pin out of his pocket \nand slowly slipped it into the lock on the door that \nopened the gun store they’d been hiding behind \nsilently. Saying a prayer under his breath he ever so \ncarefully and slowly maneuvered it until he heard \nthe slight clicking sound. “Thank you” he whispered. \nHe placed his sweaty palm around the knob and \nslowly turned it being careful not to make a sound. \nWith it opened, he and Elizabeth let out a sigh of \nrelief as there was no one in the store. Luckily this \none hadn’t been looted in the chaos in the \nbeginning.  \n        \n\n      \n        \nThey slowly moved in, Elizabeth so close behind \nKenton, he could feel the warmth of her moist \nbreath. They found where the weapons had been \ndisplayed. Kenton picked off a twelve gauge from the wall along with four boxes of shells, from the \ndisplay case he picked a .454 magnum up surprised \nby the weight and the how the cool steel and \nplywood felt in his grip than walked behind the \ncounter, and picked up three boxes of ammunition. \nWhen he noticed the M-16 automatic rifle propped \nup against the back of the counter. The owner of the \nstore was obviously planning to use but never got \nthe opportunity to. “Good, better for us.” He thought. \nWhen he did he hated himself a little for being so \nheartless. But quickly dismissed the feeling and \nfound where the ammunition had been stored and \npicked it up along with the sling that had been \nplaced next to it and attached the sling and placed it \naround his back. After loading the weapons and \nputting the rest in a place where he could easily \naccess, he put the .454 in the gun holster he had \nlooted off a corpse that had been thoroughly \nexecuted with a bullet to the back of the head. \nKenton could still vividly see the pool of blood and \nskull fragments that had quietly settled around the \npoor man in the back of his subconscious. He \nsnapped out of the gruesome thought and placed \nthe excess ammunition in his bag and decided there \nwasn’t anywhere else to hold another gun and \nbegan to gather up his newly stocked bag. \n \n\n\n          \nAs he and Elizabeth were exiting the shop, he \nnoticed a door that he somehow missed upon first \narrival. On the other side of the door, he heard a wet \nslurping noise that almost sounded like a dehydrated dog attempting to drink from its bowl. He didn’t know why, but he had to know what was on the other side of that door… He felt the cool metal against his sweaty anxious palm. He slowly turned the knob and the door opened. He immediately regretted the decision. What he seen would forever burned into his memory. In the dark crowded room, a man with a noose around his thick neck hung a foot off the ground. And around the poor souls feet was a thick pool of blood with bits and pieces of torn flesh and a… a half-eaten hand with three missing fingers… It was then that Kenton noticed one of the undead on the man. Its hands digging into the stomach of the man ripping it open with ease. Kenton stared in shock as the man’s small intestine slowly slip out and dangled inches off the ground slowly swaying back and forth and the undead man took giant bites into the poor man’s flesh. And in a hypnotic gaze Kenton watched as the blood poured out of the man like a waterfall hitting the ground making the pool bigger. He had failed to notice Elizabeth screaming at him and the undead man now absent from the scene and who was now shambling towards him. And when he did, it was too late. The undead man fell onto Kenton with his full weight, taking all the breath out of him. In a panicked set of motions he desperately reached for the .454 that was in its holster. But as he did, time seemed to freeze. He stared into its lifeless eyes that were now pure glossy white, no pupil or lens left, which terrified Kenton. But when he looked upon the mouth of the creature he felt a fear that he had never experienced before, a mind numbing fear that sent a cold shiver to his very core. The undead man was grinning at him. An evil, soulless, demonic grin that took the color out of his face… He then seemed to float out of his body and watch the events unfold. Like a dream. He watched as he pulled out the .454, centered the gun against its temple, cocked the hammer back, and pulled the trigger spraying the opposing wall with thick murky blood, brain matter, and bits of skull fragment. \n\n\n\n         \nHe snapped back into reality. He quickly jumped to his feet knowing the gunshot that still buzzed in his almost deafened ears would certainly alert more to their presence. He quickly grabbed Elizabeth and turned to run out the door. It was then he noticed the man who hung himself had reanimated, and was desperately trying to break free of the noose but to no success. He felt pity on the man. He pointed his magnum at his head and shot. There was now a gaping hole where the man’s left eyes once was. With that, they quickly evacuated the shop and made a desperate run towards the old grocery store. By the time Kenton and Elizabeth got halfway to the store dozens of the undead were running after them. “FASTER!” Kenton shouted as he was firing rounds off into the crowd. They reached the store, and put a little distance between themselves and the horde.\n\n   \n \n     \n But once they stepped inside they looked upon the store with horror. The undead were here. Hordes of them. They looked up from the piles of dead they were feasting on eyes fixed upon Kenton and Elizabeth. “Run!” screamed Kenton. They broke into a sprint with the undead not far behind running after them. Kenton managed to blow the heads off a couple with the .454 while firing into the horde behind them. They had finally reached the stairs and only one appeared on them. Kenton ran up next to it, took the 12 gauge that Elizabeth had been holding and shoved the barrel into its mouth as it let out a high pitched moan and fired. Completely blowing of the lower portion of the undead’s head sending it spiraling over the railing doing acrobatics as it flew down. They ran up the emergency stair well all the way to the roof and quickly slammed the door shut. Kenton took the opportunity to reload his various weapons. The nearby hovering chopper saw them and quickly flew over to the roof the couple was on. It flew close enough for the couple to get on board. Kenton picked up Elizabeth’s small figure with ease and quickly handed her to the soldier who was completely decked out in full protective body gear and a gas mask making him appear bulky and overweight. As she safely got aboard, Kenton slowly stepped back and gazed at her. She looked at him with confused gaze. “Kenton what in the hell are you doing?! Get up here NOW!!” She screamed almost crying now. He didn’t say anything. He just stood and looked at her perfect features. Her soft red hair flowing in the wind, her flawless complexion, her gorgeous face… Everything about her perfection he took in one last time. “I’m sorry my love I can’t go…” He said with tears rolling down his cheeks. Elizabeth only than noticed the deep bite mark that protruded his neck already making the skin around the wound decay. “NO!!!!” She screamed at the top of her lungs she was now bawling. She attempted to jump out to hug him but was stopped by the solider. “Please don’t cry my love. You are safe, that’s all that matters… I promised I’d keep you safe and I did. Be happy my love. I love you so much and I always will Elizabeth.” He took the wedding ring off his finger, and placed it in the palm of her hands and kissed her goodbye. \n\n\n         \n That’s when the door broke down and dozens of the undead poured out. “I love you” he cried as the helicopter lifted into the air and took off. He then turned and faced the now approaching undead horde. The 12 gauge in his hands and the M-16 dangling carelessly around his back. He opened fire into the horde blowing off limbs and sending groups of them spiraling backwards. Through the thick red mist created by their blood, he could see that demonic grin they all seemed to have. “Damn out of ammo he said.” He then dropped the weapon to his feet and pulled the M-16 from around his back and opened fire into the oncoming horde. He was unsure of how many he had actually killed. The blood spurting out of the undead bodies like water erupting from a geyser.  Spraying bullet after bullet into the undead mass that was now sprinting towards him, Kenton heard the distinct ping sound indicating that the gun was now out of ammo. Not wasting any time Kenton dropped the M-16 and pulled his .454 magnum out. Glancing down upon it the looking at the undead horde sprinting at him, he slowly lifted the gun to his temple, cocked the hammer back, whispered the words “I love you Elizabeth” one last time and gently pulled the trigger. The last thing that Elizabeth saw as the helicopter escaped the building that’s rooftop was now painted red was the faint red mist coming from Kenton’s skull and his body slowly falling into oblivion, than hitting the ground with a horrid thumping noise that would haunt her forever     ",

    "passage": "Extraordinary Measures\n\n\tI didn’t snap. It was much more gradual than that. It was like slipping off the edge of a cliff, fingers scraping the top, until in one moment that seemed like an echo of something that never existed I was falling. When I went to bed last night, I was still hanging on; when I woke up, I was crashing. I don’t know what came undone while I slept. It had been three weeks, two days, and thirteen hours, I’d guess, since I went over the edge—nothing special.  But that was the day I knew I’d never see the top of the cliff again.\n\n\n\tThat morning I didn’t know it had happened. I felt the same, that sort of feeling that I was a rusty machine and when I walked I could feel every screw and bolt and joint twisting slowly, grating in place because the whole thing was wound up too tight. I was so used to it by then. I wasn’t even surprised when I could walk through the ghost.\n\n\n\tHer name was Dr. Aimee Joyce, and I have seen her every day for three months.\n\n\n\tThree weeks and two days ago, my alarm clock went off at 5:30 a.m. and I woke up to a glimmer of light slowly burning along the edges of the room like a fuse. I blinked, trying to bring it into focus, and I felt the bed shift.\n\n\n\t“Good morning.” A hand rolled me onto my back, and Aimee kissed me on the cheek.\n\n\n \tI moaned something unintelligible. She chuckled, patted my shoulder and stood up, the springs squeaking. I heard the patter of her footsteps and squeezed my eyes shut, but the burning yellow light still seeped in. \n\n\n\t“Is there any chance we could come up with a gentler wakeup call?” I rolled out of bed, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\n\t“The alarm clock and a kiss have yet to be effective, so this is the only option left.” \n\n\n\tLights turned on in the bathroom, and I fumbled through my drawers, squinting. A whisper of water signaled the shower starting.\n\n\n\t“And you’d be late if I didn’t get you up.”\n\n\n\t“That’s true.” I buttoned my shirt. “But it’s kinda . . . disorienting.”\n\n\n\t“That’s alright,” she called. “You’re sort of cute when you’re blinking and confused.”\n\n\n\tI rolled my eyes. Pulling my pants on, I shuffled into the kitchen, started the coffee, and opened the fridge. While I waited for the coffee, I took out some yogurt and poured a little granola in it and grabbed a plastic spoon to mix it up. Then I looked at my reflection in the fridge and fixed my hair a bit—close enough. \n\n\nI’ve never been much for putting an effort into anything I don’t care about, like neat hair. Aimee tells me I’m a bit of a cowboy: I only follow my own rules. Aimee, on the other hand, sticks to the rules. Everything is as orderly at home as it is at the hospital. She has the light touch of a surgeon and a voice full of light to match. She makes mornings bearable.\n\n\nI heard the whoosh of the blow-dryer. When the coffee was ready, I poured it into two to-go cups with two creams in hers and one sugar in mine. Just as I finished, Aimee walked out with her strawberry blonde hair twisted into a damp bun. I handed her the coffee and the parfait. \n\n\n\t“Thanks,” she murmured, taking a swig. “What are you going to eat?”\n\n\n\tI shrugged. “I’ll get a breakfast burrito on the way into work.”\n\n\n\t“You know that, as a doctor, I’m obliged to tell you that isn’t healthy, right?”\n\n\n\tI grinned, taking a sip. “I know.” \n\n\n\tShe shook her head, a small smile creeping across her face. “I can’t always take care of you. You need to learn to live on your own.”\n\n\n\tWhile she was eating, I brushed my teeth and took my gun from the lockbox and holstered it.\n\n\n\t“You ready to go?” I walked in and grabbed the keys off the counter. She nodded and took her own. I was turning the front door knob when she her fingers curled over my shoulder.\n\n\n\t“Be careful, Dave.”\n\n\n\t“I will.”\n\n\n\t“I love you.”\n\n\n\t“Love you too.” And I kissed her, and we went out the door. That was the last time we spoke.\n\n\n\tEvery morning after I saw her the way I used to: smiling and talking and kissing me good morning and goodbye, and when I walked out the door I realized I saw her in the dark because there was no one to open the blinds and I realized there was nothing except cold and hollow space. I was alone.\n\n\n\tI never hear her because the last time I saw her—really saw her, not just something my mind conjured up—there was a glass wall between us, and I guess my mind has always kept that there.\n\n\n\tThree weeks and two days ago, my partner, Ramsey, and I were filling out paperwork for a case we’d just wrapped up with the news running in the background when something caught my ear: Crown Hill Hospital, where Aimee worked. I dropped my pen.\n\n\n\t“Ramsey, turn up the volume.”\n\n\n\tHe raised an eyebrow and obliged. \n\n\n\t“…on the fourth floor. Police estimate there are almost sixty hostages.”\n\n\n\tAimee’s floor. I jumped up, and Ramsey jumped after me. \n\n\n\t“Dave, wait.” He grabbed my arm. I wrenched away. My vision tunneled as I stormed across the room. “We have to let local LEOs handle this.” I pounded down the stairs. “You know they get pissed when feds—.”\n\n\n\t“I DON’T GIVE A SHIT.” I whipped around, vision blurry, knuckles white, air buzzing.\n\n\n\tRamsey looked at me calmly and held out his hand. “Give me your keys.” \n\n\n\tIt took ten minutes. The whole ride, it felt like my bones were slowly turning to lead. We stopped in a parking lot full of cop cars and sirens. Red and blue lights flashed on dull concrete and a dripping gray sky. The glass walls of the hospital rose tall and turquoise from the ground. When I looked at the building, every room behind the glass was empty except one on the fourth floor packed with cowering people and three masked men with automatic weapons. \n\n\n\t“We should—,” Ramsey began. I turned my head sharply and turned off his voice.\n\n\n\tI ran toward the chief of police. He turned around as I came sprinting up, bushy eyebrows furrowed.\n\n\n\t“Is there a Dr. Aimee Joyce in there?” I panted.\n\n\n\t“Who are you?” His voice was rough like sandpaper.\n\n\n\t“FBI Agent David Bretton. Is there a Dr. Aimee Joyce in there?” \n\n\n\tRamsey came up and put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n\t“And who are you?”\n\n\n\t“His partner. Can you tell us anything about the people up there?”\n\n\n\t“This isn’t your case.” The chief began to turn back around. \n\n\n\tI lunged. Ramsey caught me. “Tell me if she’s there!”\n\n\n\tHe looked at me, scrutinized, narrowed eyes. Ramsey loosened his grip when I stopped struggling. He sighed. “She’s there.”\n\n\n\tStatic. There was that weird buzzing all over like we were on TV and the satellite signal had been lost. I looked up at the glass and tried to make words but they wouldn’t come.\n\n\n\t“Dave?” Ramsey said. The corners of my eyes pixelated into black and white: static.\n\n\n\tI looked back at the chief. “Are you getting them out?” sounded like muffled thunder.\n\n\n\t“We’re trying to negotiate.”\n\n\n\t“Chief, they’re saying they’re going to prove they’re serious.” A person appeared next to us. “We need you over here now.”\n\n\n\tHe walked away. I looked up. People were crouched down, barely distinguishable as they melded into a mass of fear and flesh. The men, all in black, stalked through them. I couldn’t find her.\n\n\n\t“Dave, can you hear me?”\n\n\n\tI couldn’t find her. I had to find her. Everyone had their faces buried behind their knees. I couldn’t find her. \nWhere was she? The green-blue tinted glass distorted everything. I couldn’t\n\n\n\t“We need to go.”\n\n\n\tfind her. I just had to\n\n\n\t“You shouldn’t be”\n\n\n\tfind her and\n\n\n\t“here. You can’t help. We need”\n\n\n\tget her out. If I could see her maybe I could help her, tell her\n\n\n\t“to go. Let’s get in the car. Come on, let’s”\n\n\n\thow to escape. She wasn’t there, she wasn’t there, I couldn’t\n\n\n\t“get in the car. Dave, can you”\n\n\n\tfind her, I needed to find her, I needed her\n\n\n\t“hear me? are you listening? Dave, look”\n\n\n\twith me. I needed to hold her\n\n\n\t“at me. Look away from”\n\n\n\thand and tell her everything was going to be okay because\n\n\n\t“the building. Look at me. You’ve got to look away.”\n\n\n\tright now it was going to hell and I just needed to find her. But I couldn’t.\n\n\n\tOne of the men bent over, and every sound died. He slung the automatic behind him, grabbed someone and yanked them up by the hair: strawberry blonde. Aimee. Her hands were clawing at his on her neck as he pushed her toward the glass. She was fighting, but he was winning. Slowly, steadily, he pushed her closer to the glass walls that twisted the light around them. She kicked at the ground, scratched at his arms, but he never flinched. He threw her at the glass, and she bounced into it, elbows smashing against it, where I could see her face.\n\n\n\tShe was crying. Her face was distorted, and the fight was shaking through her body. She turned and ran and he pulled a handgun and shot her straight through the head. Scarlet slung across the glass shattered like a spider web and I saw her body slam into the ground between the cracks.\n\n\n\tI don’t remember anything after that.\n\n\n\tLater, they told me there was nothing I could have done or could do. That it was random. That the men wanted to prove they would kill. That Aimee was the only one they killed. That I couldn’t have her body because it was part of an ongoing investigation. That they couldn’t tell me what the men wanted because it was part of an ongoing investigation. Because after they killed Aimee they got away.\n\n\n\tI didn’t snap. I walked through the ghost and realized that I would never be able to find her behind that glass, that it was always going to be cold and hollow. So I grabbed my bag, grabbed my gun, grabbed my keys, and I got on the highway, driving west until the dawn seemed to retreat before lost nights rumbling toward me. I drove to find the men who killed Aimee. \n",

It’s also rich in conjugated linoleic acid, a type of fat that may actually help protect against weight gain. There’s no need to eat it if it doesn’t sit right with your particular digestive system, but it definitely doesn’t deserve its spot as the poster child for bad nutritional choices.\n\n\nPotential Objections to Eating Butter\n\nThe problem with butter is that its reputation proceeds it. Before diving into the health benefits, here’s a look at some of the common reasons why people don’t want to eat butter or don’t consider it Paleo.\n\n_But Butter Wasn’t Around in the Paleolithic!_\n\nTechnically, no. But if you’re only going to eat things that were around in the Paleolithic, you’d better also stop eating almost all meat you can buy at a supermarket (including beef, chicken, and pork), and most commonly available fruits and vegetables, because those weren’t around in the Paleolithic either.\n\nIT’S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RE-CREATE THE DIET OF PEOPLE IN THE PALEOLITHIC, because we don’t have the foods that they ate: when was the last time you had auroch steak? The point of Paleo is to learn from Paleolithic diets, isolate the parts that made them healthier, and imitate them with modern foods in the areas that matter. So the question about butter isn’t “was it around in the Paleolithic?” but “Does it fit into a healthy human diet, based on what we know about human nutritional needs from our evolutionary history?” Whether or not it was literally available in the Paleolithic isn’t important.\n\n_But Butter is a Kind of Dairy!_\n\nA more reasonable objection on the “butter isn’t Paleo” front is that butter is a dairy food. Dairy is a Paleo gray area because the proteins it contains don’t play nicely with everyone’s immune system, and the carbohydrates can cause digestive problems. Some variations on Paleo (like versions designed for autoimmune diseases) completely exclude it.\n\nThat’s all true, and some people do better with all dairy completely out of their diet. But even if they can’t eat other forms of dairy, many people can actually tolerate butter very well. Butter is almost entirely fat, with very low levels of the proteins and carbohydrates that make other dairy foods potentially problematic. And you can actually clarify it to make ghee (also called clarified butter) which has even fewer milk proteins and carbohydrates. Making ghee basically involves heating the butter at a very low heat until the water evaporates and the proteins float to the top, and then skimming off the protein to get the pure fat. Ghee is almost pure fat, like tallow or other animal fats.\n\nEven ghee still won’t play nicely with everyone’s body, but a lot of people who can’t do milk or yogurt or other dairy foods can still eat ghee or butter without an issue.\n\n_But What About the Saturated Fat and Cholesterol!_\n\nYes, butter is high in saturated fat and cholesterol. If you’re eating Paleo, you should already know that neither of those is a demon killer nutrient that will strike you dead of instant heart failure the moment you look sideways at a steak. In fact, cholesterol is actually very important – for example, it helps you synthesize Vitamin D from sunlight. Here’s more on saturated fat, and here’s a bunch of studies on cholesterol, if you don’t already know the Paleo take on those or need a refresher.\n\n[Dairy products]\n\n\nNutritional Benefits of Butter\n\nSo maybe butter doesn’t actually deserve its reputation as a heart attack in a convenient 8-tablespoon stick. But having said all that, why would you want to eat this food? Actually, it has quite a few nutritional upsides.\n\n_Vitamin K2/”Activator X”_\n\nOnce upon a time in Cleveland, Ohio, there was a dentist called Weston A. Price who was really interested in the nutritional underpinnings of health. To make a long story very short, he traveled all around the world and documented the diets of traditional cultures with very low rates of tooth decay and cavities. Then he came home and did experiments on his patients until he had isolated some of the foods he thought were particularly important for dental health.\n\nOne of the nutritional observations he made was the existence of some substance called “Activator X:” it sounds like a science project from the next Captain America movie, but it’s actually a nutrient that helps the body use other vitamins to strengthen bones and teeth. Weston A. Price determined that it was present in butter (among other foods, like bone marrow and fish eggs), but didn’t know much else about it.\n\nToday, we think Activator X is probably Vitamin K2. You can read all about Vitamin K2 here, but here are the highlights:\n\n-   Vitamin K2 helps your bones use calcium properly, so it ends up in your skeleton where they belong (and not, say, in your arteries where it doesn’t belong and where it causes dangerous plaques). Vitamin K2 is also important for other vitamins, like A and D – Dr. Price called it an “activator” because it helps your bones use those vitamins. So it’s important for BONE HEALTH AND FOR HEART HEALTH.\n-   You can make it from Vitamin K1 (that’s the “vitamin K” in vegetables) but the conversion is inefficient.\n-   Your gut flora can make it themselves, but most people can’t get enough just from that.\n\nInstead of trying to convert K1 to K2 yourself, it’s much easier to let the cow do it. Unlike you, a cow has four stomachs – digesting tons of plant roughage is exactly what they were designed to do. The cow eats grass rich in K1 and converts it to K2, and the K2 is present in the milk. The fattier the dairy product, the more concentrated the K2, so butter is exactly what you want to be eating to get the full benefits.\n\n_Butyric Acid_\n\nButyric acid is another area where eating butter helps support something useful that your gut flora do. Butyric acid is a short-chain fatty acid that a healthy person’s gut flora naturally produce from indigestible fiber (like the fiber in fruits and vegetables), but plenty of people have gut damage that can make fiber difficult or impossible to digest.\n\nButyric acid has anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory benefits in the gut, and it can affect the permeability of the intestine (“leaky gut”). That’s important, because gut inflammation and permeability are huge in AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES (INCLUDING THE AUTOIMMUNE COMPONENTS OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES). Butyrate is also an energy source for the colon, which sounds boring until you realize that it may help prevent COLON CANCER. There’s also some evidence that it helps control feelings of hunger and fullness, through its effects on hormones produced in the gut.\n\n_Conjugated Linoleic Acid_\n\nGrass-fed (and only grass-fed!) butter is also rich in another type of fatty acid called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). CLA may have significant ANTI-OBESITY BENEFITS, and you can read all about it here.\n\n[Delicious butter]\n\n_Fat Quality_\n\nButter is also just generally a great source of high-quality fat. Paleo in general is big on fat quality as much as fat quantity; nobody is advocating a high-fat diet based on canola oil! The calories in butter are almost entirely fat. Regular butter is about 82% fat and 18% water, proteins, and carbohydrates. Clarified butter is about 99% fat, with only a very tiny amount of anything else.\n\nFrom a Paleo perspective, the fat in butter is a very high-quality food:\n\n-   Low in potentially inflammatory Omega-6 PUFA\n-   Moderately high in monounsaturated fat\n-   High in saturated fat\n\nYes, “high in saturated fat” counts as a benefit: it makes the butter stable for high-heat cooking, and as discussed above, saturated fat isn’t actually the devil.  Butter also contains a notable amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a type of fat particularly helpful for low-carb diets or anyone who has trouble digesting fat (like people with gallbladder problems).\n\n\nSumming it Up\n\nButter is easier to tolerate than most other forms of dairy, and clarifying it into ghee makes it even easier. It’s a nice way to get the nutritional benefits of dairy foods with a very low dose of the carbohydrates and proteins that can make dairy problematic for some people. Of course, no one food is right for everyone and some people might still struggle even with ghee, but for most people, butter and ghee should be fine to cook with and eat.\n\nAnd on top of being incredibly tasty, butter and ghee have some great health benefits. Clarified or not, butter is a high-quality cooking fat rich in Vitamin K2 and healthy fats that help reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and even protect against weight gain.\n",

    "passage": "Deborah (Handel)\n\n_DEBORAH_ (HWV 51) is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel. It was one of Handel's early oratorios in English and was based on a libretto by Samuel Humphreys. It received its premiere performance at the King's Theatre in London on 17 March 1733.\n\nThe story of the oratorio takes place in a single day and is based on the Biblical stories found in 4 and 5 Judges. The Israelites have been subjugated for 20 years by the Canaanites, when the prophetess Deborah foretells the death of the Canaanite commander Sisera at the hands of a woman. The Israelite commander Barak leads them into battle against the Canaanites. The Israelites are victorious and a woman, Jael, assassinates Sisera as he sleeps in her tent.\n\nHandel reused music from numerous previous compositions for _Deborah_. The work, with large choruses and grand orchestral effects, was very successful and was revived by Handel in subsequent years.\n\n\nBackground\n\n[London King's Theatre Haymarket, where “Deborah” was first performed] By 1733, Handel had spent nearly twenty years composing and presenting seasons of Italian opera in London. The great success of _Esther_ the previous year had shown Handel that there was potential for further works of “Sacred Drama”, performed in concert form in English. _Deborah_ reuses much music Handel had previously composed, including passages from the Brockes Passion, Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno, the Dixit Dominus, and others.[1] _Deborah_ was performed as part of Handel's season at the King's Theatre in 1733, with the stars of the Italian opera singing in English, and the composer / impresario was so confident of the work's success that he doubled the price of admission for the first performance, causing some resentment and comment in the press.[2] A feature of the work is massive choruses, some in eight parts rather than the usual four, and grandiose orchestral effects featuring trumpets and drums. One witness to the first performances noted “It is very magnificent, near a hundred performers, among whom about twenty-five singers” while another remarked “'tis excessive noisy, a vast number of voices and instruments, who all perform at a time.”[3]_Deborah_ achieved considerable popularity and was revived by Handel in a number of subsequent seasons.[4]\n\n\nDramatis personae\n\n[Painting from the 1730s of singer who created roles in Handel operas and oratorios, Anna Maria Strada, creator of the role of Deborah]\n\n  |Role                                     |Voice           |1733 cast\n  ----------------------------------------- ---------------- ---------------------\n  |Deborah                                  |soprano         |Anna Maria Strada\n  |Barak, commander of the Israelite army   |alto-castrato   |Senesino\n  |Abinoam                                  |bass            |Antonio Montagnana\n  |Sisera                                   |alto            |Francesca Bertolli\n  | Jael                                    |soprano         |Celeste Gismondi\n  |An Israelite Woman                       |soprano         |Celeste Gismondi\n  | Chief Priest of Israelites              |bass            |Antonio Montagnana\n  |Chief Priest of Baal                     |bass            |Gustavus Waltz\n  |Herald                                   |tenor           |\n  |Chorus of the Priests and Israelites     |                |\n  | Chorus of the Priests of Baal           |                |\n\n  : \n\n\nSynopsis\n\n[Gustave Dore, Deborah.] [Jael killing Sisera, by Artemisia Gentileschi] [Jael shows the slain Sisera to Barak, by James Tissot]\n\nAct 1\n\nThe Israelites long for a leader who will deliver them from the oppression of the Canaanites. The prophetess and Judge, Deborah, exhorts Barak, head of the Israelite army, to save the country from subjugation and lead an army against General Sisera, commander of the Canaanite forces. Deborah prophesies that Sisera will meet death at the hands of a woman. Jael, presented in the oratorio as a female associate of Deborah, longs for security in her homeland. The father of Barak, Abinoam, adds his voice to those asking Barak to lead an army against their oppressors. A herald arrives from Sisera, announcing the General's arrival to explain the dire consequences that will fall on the Israelites should they attack, but Deborah, Barak and their people are confident that victory will be theirs.\n\nAct 2\n\nSisera and priests of Baal arrive to counsel the Israelites not to attack but Deborah and Barak reject the possibility that the God of Israel will not conquer. Abinoam looks forward with pride to his son Barak's victory, and Deborah advises her friend Jael to retire to her tent during the upcoming battle. The Israelites are confident that God will aid their arms.\n\nAct 3\n\nThe Israelites have defeated the greatly superior forces of the Canaanites. Abinoam joyfully welcomes his victorious son back from battle. Jael announces that Sisera is dead, and relates how the defeated general sought refreshment and rest in her tent. Jael brought him milk, and when he had fallen asleep, she took a hammer and drove nails through his skull. All acclaim her action and celebrate the nation's deliverance.[5][6]\n\n\nRecordings\n\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n| Year            | Cast:Deborah,   | Conductor,      | Label           |\n|                 | Barak,          | orchestra       |                 |\n|                 | Abinoam,        | and chorus      |                 |\n|                 | Sisera,         |                 |                 |\n|                 | Jael            |                 |                 |\n+=================+=================+=================+=================+\n| 1993            | Yvonne Kenny,   | Robert King     | CD:Hyperion     |\n|                 | James Bowman,   | The King's      | Records         |\n|                 | Michael George, | Consort         | Cat:CDA66841-2  |\n|                 | Catherine       | and Choir of    |                 |\n|                 | Denley,         | New College,    |                 |\n|                 | Susan Gritton   | Oxford          |                 |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n| 2002            | Elisabeth       | Joachim Carlos  | CD: Naxos       |\n|                 | Scholl,         | Martini         | Cat:8.554785-87 |\n|                 | Lawrence Zazzo, | Barockorchester |                 |\n|                 | Jelle           | Frankfurt and   |                 |\n|                 | S.Draijer,      | the Junge       |                 |\n|                 | Ewa Wolak,      | Kantorei        |                 |\n|                 | Natacha Ducret  |                 |                 |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n\n: \n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n",

    "passage": "[RF] Fallacious Reverie\n\n                                               I\n\tAnnalee looked feverishly at the clock. Two hours. She had to leave before those two hours were up or she never would. Two hours until Shane came home from work. She had spent the day packing what little she had and if she wasn't gone by the time he came home he would know she meant to leave. Annalee had spent the last year and a half under the control of Shane and today was the day she would free herself from the confines of his wrath. She ran up stairs to make sure she had gotten her mother's pearls when she heard keys in the front door. She stopped. No. She still had time. \n\tShane comes through the door, and sees her bag at the door. Annalee is rooted in the bedroom but all too aware that he is making his way up the stairs. No. He calmly opens the door and by the look on his face she knows there isn't a chance that she will be walking away from this. Today wasn't the day. She didn't have time.\n\tShane, smelling like cheap whiskey, walks over to her and demanded to know why there is a suitcase by the sofa. Sarcastically,he asks if she was planning a trip for the two of them. He closes the door and begins to walk over to her. Still fixed in one spot like someone had put nails in her shoes. The questions still lingering in the air like a suffocating gas. Annalee starts to speak but he strikes her across the face, her mother's pearls sent flying under the bed.  What happens next occurs so fast that all she can see is the blur of the terrible blue wall paper. He's in front of her, hands around her neck. Shaking. Squeezing. Laughing. \nPop.\n\tAnnalee reaches for something. Anything. In hopes of making herself steady. Instead her hand finds the silver lamp on the dresser. Something, shy of animal instinct, helps her bring the lamp swinging into Shane's left temple. The rage in his eyes goes out like a light as he falls to the ground. She hits him not once, but twice more until red beads of blood make a splash on the blue wall paper. Annalee slumps to her knees. Was he dead? Is this nightmare over? She reaches for his phone in the front pocket of his slacks. Shane groans on the floor, blood trickling from the tear in his skin. She presses three keys and waits until she hears a voice on the other end.\n\tAfter a moment Annalee tries to speak but no words come out, only a whisper of a scream. Assuming that was enough, she gets off the line and holds tight to the lamp. It felt like an eternity before she heard the sirens. Four men in uniforms entire the room, one speaks to her but she can only blink in response. He checks her pulse while another does the same to Shane. Their voices sounding like static as they report something over the walkies. More people show up, this time in white paramedic uniforms. Shane was taken some where but they hadn't tried to move Annalee. She's put on a stretcher, a brace around her neck. \n\tThe bright lights of the ambulance is all she can see. The sound of the siren the only sound in her mind. Scared that she would be charged with assault or attempted murder. Surely they could see the scars that covered her body. Surely they would find the small attic space with her blood dried in the scratches on the door. She couldn't speak to tell them, they would have to come to the conclusion themselves. The fast beeping on a monitor seemed to worry the paramedic as he leaned over and picked up her arm. She felt a warmth spread through her body and the lights of the ambulance seemed to grow dim. Surely they would see the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tII\n\n\tAnnalee comes to in a hospital room. White. Sterile. Quiet. She calls for a nurse, and to her surprise a voice comes out. The nurse, grim look on her face, calls the doctor. Doctor Silverman introduces himself and looks much more pleasant than the nurse. He informs her that her neck may be sore for the next few days and her voice may sound hoarse but he has high hopes that she will be good as new. Continuing with the good news he states that she can leave as soon as they do one more check up and once the police question. \n\tDoctor Silverman is just finishing up his test when two police officers come into the room. Apprehension and terror wash over Annalee as they sit down. They have questions. What was her relationship to Shane? How long had she known him? What events led up to her muted call? The answers for those questions led to more. How long has the abuse been going on? Did she plan to hurt Shane that day? What attic was she talking about? Why didn't she leave sooner? It seemed as if they were putting her on trial for defending herself. Trying to save her own life. She became frantic. A nurse was called in to sedate her.\n\tWhen she awoke she found herself in a different room. Dark. Ominous. Cold. She could hear muffled yelling and even  more disturbing, whispering. Annalee got out of bed and moved to the door. There wasn't a knob.  Terrified, she began to bang on the door and call out to anyone that may be able to help her. She had fought so hard to escape Shane but now she was locked away again. The sense of urgency set her body on  fire. She was suppose to be free of control. The room seemed to be getting smaller. Closing inch by inch in on her. Back at the door she began kicking and screaming, hoping to at least get the attention of someone so she could tell them she didn't belong here. No one came.\n\tShe must have fallen asleep at some point since she was jarred awake by the opening of her door. Doctor Silverman entered. Only he didn't wear the same hopeful expression as he had before.  Annalee tried to move from the bed. Tried to speak. Nothing happened. The doctor looked at her chart but didn't speak directly to her. A nurse entered behind him, whispering something in his ear. Annalee thought she heard the word sister but before she could try to ask what they were talking about they exited the room. Taking the chart with them. \n\tAlone again, but unable to move or speak. The minimal color palate in the room seemed to go in and out of focus. Like she was forgetting what the colors were. Not long after that the small desk and bolted down seat began to smear at the edges. The blankets feeling like they weighed as much as a small car pressed the air out of her lungs, making it difficult to breath. A new nurse entered her room accompanied by a woman that seemed familiar to Annalee. Where had she seen this person before?\n\t Memories, floating like burning leaves in the wind came to her. A younger version of herself playing kitchen with this familiar stranger. Riding a yellow bus to a building filled with children around the same age. A flash of silver, followed by two loud bangs. Her and the stranger standing over two bodies. Weeping as if they had both lost something very important to them. The stranger came over to Annalee and dropped to her knees.  \n\tThe doctor came over and rested his hand on the shoulder of the woman. Tears began running down her face. Annalee had the urge to brush the tears away and reassure her that she was going to be okay. That she was free now. That Shane couldn't hurt her anymore. If only she could get out of the hospital, things would be okay. Sounds came from the doctors mouth, unable to comprehend them Annalee hoped it was good news but the look on the stranger's face it wasn't. The man in the white coat left the room, leaving Annalee and the woman alone. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIII\n\n\tAnnalee looked so small and peaceful as her sister, Katie, held her hand. The news had come as shock. She had gotten a call from the police two days prior looking for the next of kin. She packed her bag as soon as she got off the phone and boarded a plane to take her from California to South Dakota. The news wasn't what she had hoped for. Her sister was alive but there was no brain function. Doctor Silverman sat her down with the police and recounted the events that had led up to the tragedy.\n\tShane Price and Annalee Watts had been in a relationship just shy of two years. About the time Annalee ran away from college in California. The medical report revealed abuse going back over a years time. From badly healed broken bones, to deep scars running all over her back. Nails that had never grown back properly after being broken off from trying to claw her way out of the attic space. The police had gotten a call from an elderly man in Annalee's neighborhood. Saying he saw a young man putting what seemed to be a body in his passenger seat. \n\tThe police arrived as an inebriated Shane was locking the door with a bag in his hand. Presumably the bag Annalee had packed for herself. When they got to the car they noticed an unconscious woman in the seat, her neck at a very peculiar angle. After arresting Shane and calling an ambulance for Annalee they finally were able to piece the events that led to this together. \n\tShane came home early that day due to being laid of his job, but before coming home he stopped at a liquor store and bought a bottle of whiskey. After he arrived home he saw Annalee's suitcase by the door and went upstairs to confront her. In his mind she was betraying him, after all he had done for her she should be submissive and grateful. He charged into the room and began choking her before she ever had the chance to turn away or defend herself. He squeezed, shook and laughed while going on about what she owed him. Until her body wilted and he heard an audible pop. Which happened to be Annalee's neck breaking.\n\tIt was then that he realized he would be charged for attempted murder if he took her to a hospital. So his plan was to dump her body in a bad part of town and make it look like a robbery gone amiss. Instead, Annalee was now in the hospital being kept alive by a machine. With no living will and no hope of improvement, Katie is faced with the option of taking her sister off life support or seeing if she improves in  time.\n\tKatie sits by her sister's bed and reads her \"The Giving Tree\" like she used to when they were growing up. Praying to God and anything else that might bring her sister back to her.  But Annalee couldn't tell her sister that she was there. Trapped inside her own mind. Each day more and more of reality slipping from her mind. She fades away. Never requiring her sister produce the decision.  Dark. Silent. Alone. Gone.\n",

    "passage": "[SF] Conversations about Androids!\n\n“Mick’s one of them.” This matter of fact statement caught me off guard.\n\n“Is he?” I ask, hazarding a glance at the middle aged, balding bar man. \n\n“Course he is, look at him.” I turned around to get a better look. Mick was stood wiping down a glass, oblivious of the scrutiny to which he was currently being subjected to. \n\n“No, he isn’t.” I said “He’s got a beer belly and gravy down his shirt, the ones in the city all look like celebrities and they haven’t got a spec on ‘em.” I turned back to Dave, he was looking at the table and shaking his head. \n\n“Course they do” He said looking up his droopy eyes struggling to fix on a particular spot. He settled on staring at my chin, “Coz they’re accepted in the city, aren’t they,” he said as if he were talking to a child. “But if you put them in the country they’ve got to fit in, got to look the part haven’t they.”\n\n“So you’re saying that a company that makes millions of the same make and model every day has decided to make a fat fifty year old bar tender version so that we don’t get suspicious that they’re androids.”\n\n“Exactly,” he said with a toothy grin as if I was finally on his erratic wave length.\n\n“But if you’ve spotted the only android in the village, then it’s obviously not working.”\n\n“Well I knows what to look for dun I.” He said glancing over at Mick and leaning in with his stale beer breath. “Take a look at him, a proper look, go over and get two pints. Try and catch him just as he picks up a glass to clean and watch closely. Then look at his eyes and see how long it takes him to blink.”\n\nI eyed Dave suspiciously “Is this just coz you want a drink?” I asked.\n\n“A little,” grinned Dave “But you go over and check him anyway, I’ve done it me self.” I looked at him suspiciously and then swivelled off my chair to go and order the drinks.\n\n“Alright Mick,” I hazarded, wondering how to approach this correctly.\n\n“Alright Jeff,” he mumbled “how’s it going?” He breathed on the glass and cleaned it, wiping it with a towel.\n\n“Not bad, two pints of Green Valley please” I said inspecting the glass that he had just cleaned.\n\n“Coming up,” he said turning his back on me to get the glass. He had legs, I thought to myself, so he wasn’t like the ones in the supermarket. If he was one, it was state of the art without looking remotely state of the art at all, kind of shabby sheik. He turned back and poured the pints, concentrating on the amount and making sure the head was perfect. An android wouldn’t do that I thought to myself. Androids had this unsettling habit of doing tasks while maintaining eye contact. He looked up as he finished the second pint and I stared intently into his eyes.\n\n“Thanks Mick,” I said whilst flicking my gaze from his left eye to his right.\n\n“You alright Jeff?” Mick said unnerved.\n\nI returned to my table without a word.\n\n“He’s not an Android.” I said confidently when I sat down. Dave looked at me flabbergasted.\n\n“What!” he cried a little overdramatically “Did you even look at him?”\n\n“Yep,” I said “he had legs and everything”.\n\n“No did you look when he cleaned the glass?”\n\n“Y..yes he did it with a cloth”\n\nDave looked at me despairingly “Not how he cleaned it you muppet, did you see him breathe on the glass and it doesn’t leave any fog cause they don’t need to breathe they just mimic the action. Did you see his fingerprints on the glass?”\n\n“No” I said feeling depressed about my woeful detective skills. “What’s up with his fingerprints?”\n\n“He hasn’t got human fingerprints, that’s how come they can track them, they got special ones that are like a bar code, so each one gets its own unique set so you can find em easily.”\n\n“Why would they mimic the action of us breathing?” I interrupted, Dave looked at me incredulously.\n\n“Have you ever met someone who doesn’t breathe?” He said. “No! Cause if you did you would flip your nut wondering what was happening.” He continued “If you took an Android out for drinks, it would drink, it doesn’t need too. Just like it doesn’t need to breathe or blink but it does it anyway so that you’re not worrying why one of your work mates has stopped blinking or breathing.” I looked at him dumbfounded. I didn’t realise the technology had come this far. “Did you at least count the seconds it took him to blink?” he asked like it was the most natural thing in the world.\n\n“No” I said growing tired with the criticism. \n\n“Well it’s every 7 seconds, at least one of us is paying attention.”\n\n“Why would they need to blink?” I asked\n\n“First off so you don’t flip your nut and second to clean the cameras if something gets on them.”\nI thought about this for a few minutes drinking my pint, maybe some of my work colleagues are Androids and I hadn’t even noticed, maybe my wife was, I think I would have noticed, or would I? If I couldn’t tell if Mick was one could I really notice if anyone else was.\n\n“Does he have a penis?” I asked.\n\n“Who Mick?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Well not just Mick, Androids in general do they have sex parts?”\n\n“Can’t say I ever checked,” said Dave and we both lapsed into a deep and contemplative silence.\n\n“They must have!” said Dave after an embarrassingly long time thinking about robot genitals.\n\n“Why?” I asked dreading the answer that had dredged itself out of the sewer of his mind.\n\n“Because it was all the rage a few years back when they were still working out the kinks. Remember that politician bought one as a butler and he just hollowed out its Ken doll parts until he managed to get his dick trapped in the mechanism.”\n\n“Ooh yeah” I said, not really believing that this was true at all.\n\n“And, and!” he said leaping on his advantage and following his train of thought “Why make women androids?” He said smiling triumphantly.\n\n“Dunno,” I said “Cause that’s what you do isn’t it, you make the man and then you make the woman, if you don’t its sexist, I hear they make black ones now as well.”\n\n“Yeah but why give them genders at all? Christ why even make them look like people?”\n\n“Dunno,” I said realising that I was adding very little to this conversation.\n\n“First off to make other people comfortable around them, right? Coz if people think they’re talking to a person they’re gonna treat them like a person. Not try and take their leg cause it’s your neighbours android and his dogs been shitting on your lawn, right?”\n\n“Right!” I said, the conversation had originally been about my new dish washer.\n\n“So if you’re talking to an Android and you think it’s a person, it has to be as person like as possible, right. Breathing, blinking, all that stuff. So if a lady takes a man android home she is gonna expect him to have a fella down there, not just a fella, a fully working fella. It would just be embarrassing for both of them if he didn’t have a set of bits.”\n\n“She would find out eventually though right?”\n\n“No…yeah,” he said hesitantly “hey they’ve probably got Android prossies now, with big cyber pimps or something.”\n\nI laughed “insert coin in the slot” I said finally feeling part of the conversation again.\n\nI glanced over at Mick, he was eating a pack of crisps\n\n“Have you ever seen Mick take a shit?”\n",

    "passage": "Andrew Van Buren\n\nANDREW VAN BUREN is a British multi skilled performer, illusionist, plate spinner and showman who specialises in presenting large-scale illusions, plate spinning routines, magic, juggling and circus style skills in all type of performance venues.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAndrew Van Buren spent his childhood touring the world with his parents' Fred Van Buren and Greta's magic and illusion show. Having been taken on stage for the first time at just six weeks old, he learned his trade growing up in theatres and circus, on-stage, off-stage and backstage as well as gaining experience in fairgrounds and on multiple television and film sets. During this time he teamed up with an Hungarian State Circus artiste who taught him the art of trick cycling, which led to his performing unicycling, juggling and plate spinning with real breakable plates.\n\nAndrew now tours his own shows and specialises in theatre, corporate and cabaret settings, cruise liners, television and outdoor events. Other than in a performer capacity he is also associated with and runs several ongoing parallel entertainment industry based projects.\n\nAndrew has a daughter with his long time partner and stage assistant Allyson Ford.\n\nKey Past Venues and Projects\n\nVan Buren and his team have performed around the world, notably at the Brit Awards in the London Arena, the 2002 Commonwealth Games and before members of the British Royal family at World Expo in Seville, Spain. He has regularly performed with and made appear, disappear and float in mid-air the cast of British soap opera _Coronation Street_, comedian Peter Kay and Lulu. He has worked in British venues including The Royal Albert Hall and Wembley Arena in London, as well as regularly performing on international cruise ships and regularly presenting shows in the United Arab Emirates. Andrew also has advised in the television and film industry, for resident shows, bespoke productions and theatre tours, including for The Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nOn 8 September 2011 Van Buren presented the opening show of the New Mitchell Arts theatre in his home area of Hanley Stoke-on-Trent England - the first theatre stage he worked on as a child solo performer, returning 30 years later to present one of his illusion shows as the launch of the new £4 million refit venue.\n\nDuring 2013 amongst other projects Van Buren rescued and worked as Magic consultant, stagecraft choreographer and adviser on the show Houdini, which toured theatres in the UK - written by and starring BAFTA winning actor, writer, director and producer Stuart Brennan, with Jamie Nichols as Houdini and the Harry Potter Film actress Evanna Lynch as Bess Houdini, the play received strong reviews with The Stage Newspaper referred to the play as “a delicious piece of theatre that combines great drama with a generous helping of tricks and illusions”.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nAfter touring with his parents shows Andrew headed off performing on his own at a young age. He started off at the bottom of the showbusiness ladder working in nightclubs, raves and clubs, until he got the break into a new level of show, he was asked to represent Great Britain at World Expo before Prince Charles and Diana Princess of Wales. From this point Andrew was offered a nine and a half week tour with Music Hall Legend Danny La Rue, the nine and a half weeks ended up nearly three years touring the biggest UK theatres with the Danny La Rue show. From this new theatre tours and Summer Season shows poured in, allowing Andrew to work alongside veteran theatre and television stars of the time, including John Inman, Little and Large, Cannon and Ball, Hinge and Bracket, The Nolan Sisters, Jimmy Cricket, Ray Alan and Lord Charles, Paul Daniels, plus from the pop music industry Bucks Fizz, Erasure and many more. These shows paved the way for Andrew to upscale his own shows to a grander scale and in new directions. Seeing that there were less traditional variety shows and summer season shows, Andrew headed into corporate events with his plate spinning, working for large global companies at their conventions, conferences and meetings, often alongside the companies CEOs, also then touring his own themed magic and illusion shows, often combined with his circus skills.\n\n21st Century Magic Illusion Show spectaculars\n\nAndrew Van Buren presented a large-scale magic illusion show called Van Buren's Abracadabra Magic Around The World in Blackpool Tower Circus during the 2007 season supported by a cast of 24 international performers and numerous large-scale illusions themed to a journey around the world.

Its first performance was at the Brighton Festival before launching it on its still ongoing world tour, currently based in the Middle East and Far East as well as touring with Cirque Surreal.\n\nAlongside “Van Buren & Gandeys touring Victorian Wonders Carnival”, Andrew and Allyson are currently themselves personally touring the UK with their Outdoor arena show - “Van Buren's Victorian Wonders Show” performed at fetes, carnivals, festivals, Rallies, agricultural and all forms of outdoor event.

    "passage": "_Nov 2, 2017 —_ The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to four CBD distributors warning them to stop selling CBD products, “to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure cancer without evidence to support these outcomes.” The letters were sent October 31, 2017, followed by a more widely distributed warning the FDA posted on November 1st. The letters warn that selling CBD as a product that promotes any health benefits, especially in respect to specific diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, was a violation of federal law. The letter gave them 15 days to address the violations and take corrective action or the FDA would seek further enforcement actions.\n\nThe letters followCongressional testimony given by the FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb that the agency would soon begin to proactively examine health claims that marijuana providers are making about their products. The four companies are Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises LLC, Natural Alchemist, Greenroads Health and That’s Natural! Marketing and Consulting. The letters sent to these companies spelled out their violations, which in one case include selling an unapproved new drug (CBD), interstate commerce violations, and for misbranding (relating to dosing), and they left open the door for further actions and violations:\n\n“The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations.\n\n“You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.”\n\nThe Stanley Brothers, specifically, have been arguing with the federal government about hemp derived extracts for over a year. In March 2017 the DEA issued a memo that was supposed to clarify the legal status, but it was met with push back from the cannabis industry who believe the Farm Act of 2014 defines their products as legal industrial hemp.\n\nThe DEA memo was dismissed by the Stanleys, who have continued to promote their CBD products online. Their attorney wrote a letter in response to the DEA explaining his reasoning. They stood firmly on the claim that they were selling a industrial hemp product, and claimed the DEA had no jurisdiction in the matter. Joel Stanley penned an Op-Ed to The Cannabist in Colorado (The Denver Post’s cannabis website) where he argued against their memo.\n\nThe FDA has taken a regulatory approach. Since they control most of the drugs, they can stop the sale and distribution of compounds deemed to be “new drugs” which gives them regulatory control over the products. CBD is still considered a new drug, which means the FDA has the final word.\n\nAs of November 2, 2017, three of the four companies were still selling online, but Greenroads Health website was “Down for maintenance.” Surprisingly, Hemp CBD oil can be purchased on Amazon.com where they just avoid mentioning the CBD (see here).\n\nLetter sent to Stanley Brothers (Link to all the warning letters here):\n\nWARNING LETTER\n \nVIA SIGNATURE CONFIRMED DELIVERY\n\nOctober 31, 2017\n\nJoel Stanley, CEO\nStanley Brothers Social Enterprises, LLC\nd/b/a CW Botanicals\nd/b/a CW Hemp\n3515 N. Chestnut Street\nColorado Springs, CO 80907\n\nDear Mr. Stanley:\n\nThis is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.cwbotanicals.com (redirects to www.cwhemp.com) in August 2017 and has determined that you take orders there for the products “Everyday Dietary Supplement,” “Everyday Plus Dietary Supplement,” “Everyday Advanced Dietary Supplement” and “Charlotte’s Web Gel Pen,” which you promote as products containing cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD).  We have also reviewed your website at the internet address www.theroc.us, and your social media websites at www.facebook.com/CWHempOfficial and www.twitter.com/CWHemp; these websites direct consumers to your website, www.cwhemp.com, to purchase your products.  The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\n\nAlthough you market “Everyday Dietary Supplement,” “Everyday Plus Dietary Supplement,” and “Everyday Advanced Dietary Supplement” as dietary supplements, FDA has concluded based on available evidence that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii)]. Under that provision, if an article (such as CBD) has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD.\n\nThe existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex[1] Under FDA’s regulations [21 CFR § 312.2], unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Act. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue. . FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect.\n\nExamples of claims observed on your website www.cwhemp.com that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nOn the webpage titled “Everyday Advanced Hemp Oil”:\n\n-   _“A patient of mine uses this for Cancer and it gives lots better relief than prescription drugs!”_\n-   _“My dear ex mother in law has been diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer.

Child cancer clients take 25 mg of CBD 2x daily (50 mg/day)”_\n-   _“[C]urrent studies have reported that CBD is showing promise in how oncologists are looking to treat breast, glioma, Leukemia, thyroid, colon and lung cancer.”_\n-   _“The type of dosing that is recommended for clients in partial or complete remission is called ‘maintenance dosing’ and . . . hopefully keeping cancer at bay. Clients using maintenance dosing will likely be using much lower levels of cannabinoid intake than if they were actively trying to fight cancer.”_\n-   _“Adult cancer remission clients take 100 mg of CBD 2x daily . . . Pediatric cancer remission clients take 25 mg of CBD 2x daily, go up to 1mg/lb of body weight”_\n\nOn the webpage titled “Forums”:\n\n_Topic “Metastatic Breast Cancer” – posting by a representative of Realm of Caring:_\n\n-   _“The reported benefits of Charlotte’s Web™ Hemp Oil include . . . anti-tumoral . . . ” _\n\nTopic “Diabetes” – posting by a representative of Realm of Caring:\n\n-   _“The Charlotte’s Web Products™ Everyday Advanced 5000 is best for clients with chronic conditions and has a higher concentration of CBD at 50mg/ml.”_\n-   _“Charlotte’s Web™ Everyday 5000 is high in CBD . . . [r]esearch is showing CBD to have a wide range of benefits.

Where can I purchase CW?” CW Hemp replied: “Charlotte’s Web™ . . . [y]ou can order right from our site at cwhemp.com . . . you do not need a RX to buy Charlotte’s Web . . .”\n-   On May 21, 2016: “[L]earn how #CharlottesWeb could help #CTE and concussions in athletes!”[4]\n    https://twitter.com/CWHemp\n-   September 17, 2016 retweeted posting – “The NFL Could End CTE With a Strain of Marijuana . . .

    "passage": "Argentine Americans\n\nARGENTINE AMERICANS ()[1][2][3][4] are Americans whose full or partial origin is in Argentina.\n\n\nHistory\n\nUntil the 1970s, the Argentines that emigrated to the United States were included in the category of “Other”. Thus, the number of Argentines who emigrated to the United States up to that moment is unknown, due to the inexistence of statistics about the groups that formed that category..\n\nIn any case, it seems that the first Argentines who arrived in the United States did so during the 1950s and 1960s, seeking better economic conditions. Although, most of them had higher education (including many scientists). However, immigrants in the late 1970s arrived fleeing the political repression of the Dirty War.[5] They numbered 44,803 people.[6]\n\nThis new immigrant group had an educational level lower than earlier immigrants. The majority of Argentine immigrants headed to metropolitan areas, especially New York City, where 20 percent of them lived in the 1970s. In the 1980s, that percentage increased to just over 23 percent, and the 1990 U.S. Census recorded that New York City had 17,363 Argentine Americans and Los Angeles, 15,115.[7] Immigration to New York City was popular because of the existing Argentine and Italian communities, as many Argentines are of Italian origin. With the goal of helping its Argentine population, the government of the city created several organizations such as the Argentine-American Chamber of Commerce, which that established relations between Argentina and the United States. The 1990 U.S. Census recorded 92,563 Argentines, evidencing that nearly half of the Argentine immigrants arrived in the last two decades alone.[8]\n\nAfter the nineties, Southern California and Florida became leading destinations for new immigrants from Argentina. According to the 2010 Census, out of the over 200 000 Argentine Americans recorded, it is estimated that Los Angeles and Miami have over 50 000 Argentine Americans each, followed by the New York area.[9]\n\n\nSocioeconomics\n\nThe profile of the Argentine American population is generally similar to the overall U.S. population's. Among the key differences, however, is educational attainment. Argentine Americans exhibit a rate of 39.5% of holders of bachelor's, graduate, or professional degrees, contrasted with the 27.5% of the overall U.S. population. The difference is more marked among women: 40.2% for Argentine American females, and 26.7% for all U.S. females.[10] Another major difference is that 69.1% of Argentine Americans are immigrants, which contrasts sharply with 12.6% of the overall U.S. population.[11]\n\n\nDemographics\n\n[Alexis Bledel at the premiere of The Conspirator, Toronto International Film Festival 2010] The most noticeable Argentine American populations are in the metropolitan areas of Florida (mainly South Florida), Texas (mainly Houston and Dallas), California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Western Pennsylvania.\n\nStates\n\nThe 10 states with the largest population of Argentines (Source: 2010 Census):\n\n1.  - 57,260 (0.3% of state population)\n\n2.  - 44,410 (0.1% of state population)\n\n3.  - 24,969 (0.1% of state population)\n\n4.  - 14,272 (0.2% of state population)\n\n5.  - 13,831 (0.1% of state population)\n\n6.  - 6,263 (0.1% of state population)\n\n7.  - 5,294 (less than 0.1% of state population)\n\n8.  - 5,138 (0.1% of state population)\n\n9.  - 4,639 (0.2% of state population)\n\n10. - 4,273 (less than 0.1% of state population)\n\nCities\n\nThe 10 cities with the largest population of Argentines (Source: 2010 Census):\n\n1.

Pembroke Pines, FL - 1,147 (0.7%)\n\nEthnic background\n\nThe ancestry of the majority of the population of Argentina is primarily of Italian and Spanish ancestry (see demographics of Argentina) with significant German, British, Irish, French, Mulatto, Mestizo, Slavic, and Semitic (Jewish and Arab) components. Minority have Amerindian ancestors (primarily Mapuche, Qulla, Wichí, and Toba),[12] Chinese ancestors, Indian/Indo-Caribbean ancestors, and other Asian ancestors.\n\nLarge communities\n\nOnly data for immigrant Argentine Americans are available. The twenty U.S. communities of 500 or more people which have the highest percentages of Argentine immigrants are:[13]\n\n1.  Miami Beach, FL 4.4%\n2.  Sunny Isles Beach, FL 4.1%\n3.

    "passage": "\nShowrunning director and executive producer Mimi Leder breaks down what changed between seasons of \"The Leftovers.\"\n\n“Mimi Leder can direct the shit out of anything.”\n\nThat’s Justin Theroux describing his showrunning director on “The Leftovers,” but it’s also as close as an opinion can come to being factual — and one supported by this critic. A helmer of giant blockbusters (like “Deep Impact”) and intimate dramas (like “The West Wing”), Leder expertly transformed Damon Lindelof’s wild words — “He has a lot of huevos,” Leder said — into a unique vision that brought them to life like no one else could. And she did it with incredible insight into everything from what makes each character tick to what the audience needed to see in order to access those characters.\n\nSpeaking to Indiewire shortly before starting production on Season 3, Leder dug into how the series developed over its first two seasons, what she brought to the table as a director and why one big scene didn’t make the cut for the brilliant — and nearly feature-length — finale.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Leftovers’: An Oral History of the Finale’s Karaoke Scene, from Damon Lindelof & Justin Theroux\n\nYOU CAME ONBOARD “THE LEFTOVERS” AS A DIRECTOR AND THEN YOU MOVED INTO THE ROLE OF CO-EP, CORRECT? \n\nDamon asked me to come direct an episode, and I directed “Gladys” how I thought the show should be. It was a brand new show, so — when I came on — I felt very close to it. I felt like I somehow understood it on a much deeper level. Then, while I was editing it, they asked me to stay. There were some growing pains in the beginnings of “The Leftovers.” That’s no secret.\n\nTHERE’S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT CHANGED AND WHAT DIDN’T CHANGE BETWEEN SEASON 1 AND SEASON 2.\n\nMy perspective is that Damon and Tom Perrotta were really discovering what the show was about. You write a story and then your story starts to speak to you, and I believe that they had some growing pains in the beginning. “Who’s point of view is this?” They started doing point of view stories, which they discovered were very successful — which it always is because it’s from your character’s point of view. You immediately, as an audience, get sucked in.\n\n[Damon Lindelof & Mimi Leder on the set of \"The Leftovers\" Season 3]\nI think that these point of views became stronger. The visual language — that maybe I brought to it, especially in the second season — helped to define what that was. The first season was very muted, very claustrophobic. And in the second season, we were moving to Austin, Texas, to this little town called Miracle. And I thought it was really important to expand the color palette, to find rich, deep colors to help express our characters’ emotions. I also thought opening up the show visually was important: wider shots, showing the environment more because the environment was very pertinent to the story. So, that’s what I think I helped bring to the show.\n\nIT’S THOSE DETAILS THAT ELEVATE THINGS IN SUCH A BIG WAY, BUT IT’S HARD TO JUST POINT TO IT AND SAY, “WELL HEY, THIS IS WHAT REALLY HELPED IT EVOLVE.”\n\nYou know, it ultimately is a show about family and what it’s like to lose your family — to lose everything in your life that is special to you. And so, how do you visually explore that? How do you dive deep into someone’s soul? We use close-ups very regularly. We get in there, but we also drop back to see the body language. For me, it’s really important to really dig deep into a character’s heart and try and find what’s between those lines. What are those moments when the actor isn’t speaking? What are those moments that help express and take you to the next level? It’s a real privilege to work on this show because of Damon’s writing, and his team of writers are an extraordinary group of thinkers who attach meaning to everything. I am on the continual search for the right look, the right light, the right environment to express that.\n\nDIRECTING THE SEASON 2 PREMIERE, DID YOU FEEL IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE THE ONE TO SET THAT TONE WHEN YOU’RE STARTING OVER, IN A WAY, FOR SEASON 2?\n\nOh, absolutely. I mean, I started to open up the show at the end of the first season. I didn’t want it to look like a whole new show. I just wanted it to breathe more, and I think we did that. We had the camera breathe more. We did bigger and bolder things. The most successful shots are ones that you feel and not ones that you are watching. It’s better when you just feel them, and they speak to you.\n\nWHEN YOU WERE GETTING READY TO SHOOT OR WHEN YOU WERE ON SET SHOOTING “I LIVE HERE NOW,” THE SEASON 2 FINALE, WERE YOU AT ALL CONSIDERING THAT THIS COULD BE THE SERIES FINALE? THAT THIS COULD BE THE END?\n\nYou know, I personally did not think it would be the end, but if it was the end, I felt it was very satisfactory in terms of a man’s journey — Kevin’s journey home to his family. And it certainly could’ve been the end, but I never felt like it was resolved. Personally, I felt there were so many great moments in the finale — I’m sounding egotistical, I don’t mean to — and so many heartbreaking moments.\n\nThat one scene, for example, when Kevin is in the infirmary and John Murphy comes in and finds him and he looks at him and he goes, “I killed you.” And he goes, “Nope.” That scene, to me, was so much about how we live and get through life. Oftentimes, we never know what’s happening. We just don’t know how we’re going to get through life’s challenges.\n\n[THE LEFTOVERS SEASON 2 MIMI LEDER & CAST JUSTIN THEROUX]\nTHE FINALE IS JUST PACKED FULL OF VITAL SCENES. THERE’S NOTHING EXTRANEOUS. THERE’S NO FAT ON IT WHATSOEVER. AND YET, IT’S ALMOST FEATURE LENGTH. IT’S ABOUT 73 MINUTES LONG.\n\nAnd I shot it in 13 days.\n\nTHAT’S CRAZY.\n\nIt was so challenging, but we were so organized and so in tune with each other. Just that bridge sequence — the charging of the bridge was obviously emotional, but it was a physically difficult scene to do. That was one of the most heartbreaking scenes to film with hundreds of extras around you, but was that really what is was about? The scene was about Nora saving her baby’s life and holding onto the only thing that felt real to her. So, the scenes for me are always about what the characters are feeling and what they’re expressing.\n\nDID YOU HAVE TO CUT ANYTHING FROM THE FINALE?\n\nThere was one scene we cut, but I knew we were going to cut it before I even shot the scene. [laughs] I don’t know if I’m supposed to tell you these things.\n\nI’LL MAKE SURE HBO IS COOL WITH IT. [THEY ARE.]\n\nAfter that scene in the infirmary, Kevin and John come out and we had a scene where people had tied the pillar to a truck and were trying to pull it down. And so basically, it was John and Kevin saving the pillar-man from fighting those guys — kind of saving him together.\n\nEmotionally, it just didn’t feel right. I knew it on the page. They need to go from the infirmary to walking up the street [as they do at the end of the episode]. And that’s how I presented it. I mean, I shot the scene, but I presented my cut to Damon without the fight scene in it. He saw the fight scene and he agreed. But rarely does that happen. We do not do reshoots. We never did a reshoot on this second season, and not much is ever cut.\n\nAnd you know, by the way, when we’re filming, we are crying! We are so into it. I look next to me, to my director of photography, Michael Grady — who’s this beautiful big burly guy, tough as can be — and he has tears coming out of his eyes. It’s the most gratifying show to work on because it’s really about something. It really is about something that matters. It’s been a privilege to be a part of it.\n\n_[Editor’s Note: Indiewire’s Consider This campaign is an ongoing series meant to raise awareness for Emmy contenders our editorial staff and readership find compelling, fascinating and deserving.

    "passage": "Following his return from another season-ending knee injury, JABARI PARKER flashed moments of brilliance for the Milwaukee Bucks, but they weren’t consistent enough to guarantee anything regarding his future.\n\nParker is set to hit restricted free agency this summer, which gives Milwaukee a leg up in bringing him back as they can match any offer the Duke product were to sign.\n\nBut are they an absolute lock to match?\n\nIt probably depends on the size of the offer sheet Parker signs. The Bucks would likely scoff at matching a max contract, but something along the lines of a two-year, $20 million agreement would make their decision a bit less difficult.\n\nIn 2017-18, Parker put up decent numbers – 12.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.0 three-pointers nightly on healthy 48.2/38.3/74.1 shooting splits – but they were of the empty variety. During the small forward’s time on the floor in the regular season, Milwaukee was actually outscored by 4.3 points per 100 possessions.\n\nAnd in the playoffs, that number only got worse; the Bucks boasted an ugly -8.3 net rating in Parker’s 167 minutes of postseason action.\n\nSure, some of that may have to do with the fact that Milwaukee had a lame-duck head coach in JOE PRUNTY, a leftover from JASON KIDD’S staff who many expect will be replaced now that the team’s season is over.\n\nCould a more able leader have gotten more out of Parker this year? It’s possible.\n\nEither way, with his injury history (Parker has only been able to suit up in 183 of a possible 328 contests in his four seasons as a professional), lack of efficiency and non-existent defensive prowess, it’s hard to see Parker landing a big-time contract offer this offseason – especially the kind a player at his age (23) and with his level of potential would usually expect to receive.\n\nWe break down Parker’s likeliest landing spots.\n\n[]\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nTwo factors could make a Chicago Bulls union with Parker plausible.\n\nFor one, Parker’s hometown is Chicago, and to this day, it’s a place he still holds near and dear to his heart. In 2016, Parker penned an emotional article for the Players’ Tribune about the city, showing just how much love he has for the place where he was born and raised.\n\nAdditionally, the Chicago native is still in a part of his career that makes his fit within the Bulls’ current timeline sensical. After all, they’re a year removed from hitting the reset button and starting their rebuild, while Parker’s still a few years away from hitting his prime.\n\nAt the start of 2017-18, the Bulls’ average age was 24.5 years old. Parker will be about one year younger than that by the time the 2018-19 season rolls around.\n\nWhat’s more, though Chicago is set up decently well for the future with ball-handlers (KRIS DUNN and ZACH LAVINE) and big men (LAURI MARKKANEN and BOBBY PORTIS), their core still lacks a true wing like Parker.\n\nUltimately, the need is there, the fit makes sense and bringing a hometown hero back could help the Bulls’ front office get fans to buy into the rebuild.\n\nAs far as money goes, only three teams are projected to have more cap space than Chicago this offseason; thus, they’ll likely be willing to pay above market value for Parker’s services.\n\nA three-year, $36 million deal with a player option on Year-3 would probably be enough to let this union come to fruition.\n\n[]\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nThe Utah Jazz are pretty much solidified at the 3-spot for the foreseeable after signing the underrated JOE INGLES to a four-year, $52 million contract in the summer of 2017.\n\nHowever, at times, it’s apparent that the Jazz lack one more scorer capable of attacking in isolation. DONOVAN MITCHELL has done an outstanding job in that capacity in his rookie season. But apart from the Louisville product, Utah doesn’t really have anyone else who can be called upon to go one-on-one when they need a bucket.\n\nThat’s where a player like Parker could come into the picture.\n\nAlthough over the past two campaigns Parker hasn’t been very efficient as an isolation scorer (he placed in the 34th percentile in 2016-17 in one-on-one situations, and the 23rd percentile in 2017-18, per Synergy Sports) one of the reasons he was drafted second overall in the 2014 draft was thanks to his abilities as a point-producing weapon.\n\nPerhaps playing under a head coach like QUIN SNYDER, who’s quickly developing quite the impressive resume, could help Parker begin to reach his potential.\n\nFinancially, a union between Utah and Parker depends on what the Jazz decide to do with two of their own impending free agents: DERRICK FAVORS and DANTE EXUM.\n\nNeither should require huge deals to re-sign, but combined, they could take Utah from the $83.7 million they currently owe in salaries for 2018-19 to near the projected salary cap of $101 million.\n\nAt that point, the Jazz would only have the standard mid-level exception to offer Parker, worth roughly $8.6 million. Would that be enough to fend the Bucks away from matching the offer? Probably not.\n\nBut what if Utah lets Favors walk?\n\nThe Jazz would still bring back JONAS JEREBKO and JAE CROWDER next year, two wings with the ability to man the 4-spot next to All-NBA center RUDY GOBERT. Letting Favors sign with another team would open up the room to make a legit run at a player like Parker, who is versatile enough to play small or power forward, and whose scoring could help Utah improve upon their 15th-ranked offense from last regular season.\n\nNot to mention, Parker being a member of the LDS Church only makes a potential deal between the small forward and the team located in the heavily Mormon state all the more logical.\n\nA fully guaranteed two-year, $22 million deal between Parker and Utah, provided Favors walks, is possible, and could be rich enough to make the Bucks decline matching.\n\n[]\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nA team with a decent core but poor depth, the Detroit Pistons would also make some sense as a potential Parker landing spot.\n\nOf course, due to BLAKE GRIFFIN’S acquisition (due $31.9 million in 2018-19) and the contracts of ANDRE DRUMMOND and REGGIE JACKSON ($25.4 million owed to the big man in 2018-19, and $17 million to the point guard), Detroit is set to be about $12.6 million over the salary cap next season. This means that the only way Detroit can sign Parker would be to the standard mid-level exception.\n\nWith STANLEY JOHNSON’S development seemingly stuck in the mud – the small forward out of Arizona is shooting 37 percent as a professional, and converted on a career-low 28.6 of his three-point attempts last season – the Pistons could use help on the wing and Parker could provide it.\n\nParker has nailed 37.1 percent of his threes over the past two seasons, meaning he should be able to space the floor around Jackson-Drummond pick-and-rolls and Griffin high-post touches.\n\nPlus, he’s still pretty young; getting hard capped (something that occurs whenever a team uses its standard mid-level exception, which prevents them from crossing into the luxury tax) would be a better investment on a 23-year-old with upside than a 30-year-old journeyman.\n\nTo keep the Bucks from matching on Parker, Detroit may have to go a bit longer on their contract offer. Something like a three-year, $25.8 million offer with a player option on Year-3 would make sense (but Milwaukee may still match).\n\n[]\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nThanks to ownership of his Bird Rights (meaning Milwaukee can go over the cap to re-sign its forward) and the fact he’s set to hit restricted free agency, the likeliest possible outcome to Parker’s spell on the “open” market is a return to the Bucks.\n\nHis most recent comeback from injury didn’t go all that well, as Milwaukee was statistically a better team with Parker on the bench.\n\nNevertheless, the 6-foot-8 wing is just one season removed from averaging 20.1 points and 6.2 rebounds nightly over 51 contests, so the potential for Parker to be a reliable secondary option on offense is still there.\n\nUnder a more creative head coach, there’s a chance he and GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO could blossom into the fearsome one-two punch many hoped they’d become. What’s more, with the sense of security that comes from a long-term contract, Parker may be able to relax and just play ball for the first time in a long while.\n\nThat’s why, despite things not going as planned for Parker thus far in his career, a return to Milwaukee for the Chicago native cannot be ruled out.\n\nNot only is he still young enough to improve, but he’ll also likely be inexpensive for the Bucks to re-sign considering the lack of cap space there will be around the Association this summer.\n\nA cheap investment on a player with Parker’s still-existent upside, whom the team selected No. 2 overall just four years ago, would be smart business by Milwaukee.\n\n_You can find Frank Urbina on Twitter @frankurbina_._\n\n_HoopsHype’s Alberto de Roa contributed to this article._\n",

    "passage": "[SF] She\n\n**Part One**\n\n\n**I**\n\nShe takes me places where melody soothes me, where harps are plucked lightly to encourage men to sleep carefree within infernos of rainforests and waterfalls.  Then comes the subtle reprise of nineteenth century poetry – my wine glass is never empty and I can afford the luxury of one thousand cigarettes without fear of impending doom.\n\nI am strapped to an old-aged hospital bed, something you’d expect to see in one of those tacky horror movies about haunted mental asylums.  You know the kind, the ones where stupid teenagers find the darkest and freakiest room possible then decide to spend the night there.  \n\nThe room where I spend my days and nights (not against my will, despite the straps) is warm and white, naked except for a toilet and a large clock that wouldn’t look out of place in a school dining hall.  It reads 11:01; whether it’s AM or PM I cannot be sure.  \n\nI am unnamed but she refers to me as *The Subject*, or more recently *Subject A*.  I possess no knowledge of a life in the past; neither do I ache through wishing to acquire such knowledge.  Whatever happened in the past may rot there, forgotten and unexplored.  I live only for the visits of the magnificent woman in black, the woman who relieves the weight of the world from my shoulders with two daily injections of an obscure medicine – a medicine that cures every ailment and more.\n\nWhen I am not riding the waves of this magical concoction I drift away into the most fulfilling sleep.  I dream of floating in space, occasionally gazing back to the earth, which looks luscious and unspoiled.  It reminds me of my utter insignificance, of man’s utter insignificance, and I know that my days are better spent here in this white room, here in this bizarre but beautiful reality.\n\nI count my blessings as I lie and wait for the woman in black to return.  Over the course of my time here I’ve not once experienced any form of despair, be it the heart-freezing pain of loss, or the mind-crushing sorrow of failure.  Man’s suffering is now as alien to me as surfing the rings of Saturn.  Here, the passing of time is as smooth and steady as a leisurely afternoon stroll in the countryside.\n\nThese years have been filled with feelings of serenity – tranquillity has caressed every part of me – and I am eternally grateful to the woman from the inmost depths of my heart.  I can touch distant beauties from the comfort of where I lie.  I can visualise and be a part of the most sensational successes without the strain of applying myself.  There is nowhere else I would rather be.  \n\nFrom the corridor outside of my room the sound of footsteps are now emanating, suggesting that the woman will be here any second.  I cannot contain my excitement as I hear her pressing the electronic keypad outside of the door.  It borders on euphoria.  It is the exact elation that engulfs me each time she is near, yet there is something else brewing within me, a dark tide slowly washing over me, an unknown sensation that I start to recognise as the long lost symptoms of anxiety.\n\n*Am I going mad?*  What else could it be?  There is no reason for me to fear the owner of the footsteps, no logic behind the terror whatsoever.  But there is something inside me that is desperately trying to tell me otherwise, something that is forcing me to proceed with caution.    \n\nI call out to whoever – *whatever* – is behind the door, but no response has been forthcoming.  Petrified now, I begin to struggle on the hospital bed, tossing and turning, trying in vain to free myself from the straps that keep me in place.  This desperate need for freedom is so mystifyingly foreign to me, but my mind is screaming that this is an urge that I must act upon.  When the door sluggishly opens I am still strapped helplessly to the hospital bed.\n\nNervously, I peer towards the open doorway, half-expecting a troop of God forbidden abominations to charge through.  Yet, nothing is there.  The doorway is empty.  I am staring straight through it, deep into the darkness that occupies the other side.  \n\nWhatever nightmare awaits me; I wish it would hurry up and submerge me.  I can handle whatever melancholy – whatever evil – is thrown at me, but I cannot cope with suspense.  It’s the paranoia, you see, the troubled thoughts that race at one million miles an hour – thoughts that haven’t plagued me for as long as I can remember.  But the pain, the absolute misery, is flooding back, as if a dam has been bombed in my mind.  For each second that passes I am overwhelmed by panic.  Come what may, but come right now. \n\nThen I see her slowly making her way through the door, dazed and unbalanced.  There is what appears to be a gunshot wound just above the right lumbar region of her abdomen.  Blood is leaking out at a phenomenal rate, soaking the white marble floor.  She locks eyes with me and begins to mumble in a state of disorientation.\n\n‘I…I am so sorry.’  She is crying now, those beautiful eyes filled with hideous tears.\n\n‘I hate myself, believe me.  You have to believe me.’  \n\nI am startled to notice the knife that she is holding in her hand.  She stumbles further towards me and I know what she has in mind.\n\n‘I have to do this.  You have to understand.  I cannot let them take you.’\n\n*Who?* *Who is going to take me?*  I thought, the shock inhibiting my ability to speak.  For a split second I debate whether I am having a bad reaction to the medicine, whether all of this is real, but I know that it is wishful thinking on my behalf.  How would you cope if the woman you love came to kill you?\n\nI was ready – more than ready – to die.  In such a short space of time my entire world has collapsed around me.  I look at her one last time before closing my eyes.  I have accepted, no, I welcome, my fate.  I am one of the lucky ones.  I have been happy for an extensive period of time and I have loved, albeit not in the natural way, but it was still love.\n\nIt was then, as the woman was hovering over me, that I heard a stampede of footsteps, which were soon followed by the popping of gunshots.  Immediately, my heart broke for the woman and I began to howl in tears.  It should have been me.  I wanted it to be me. \n\n**II**\n\n‘Do you remember us, brother?’  Three men are standing above me; the woman’s lifeless body now sprawled in a bloody mess on the floor.  It was the man who had fired the shots, judging by the gun in his hand, who asked the question.  And he is a man that I have absolutely no recollection of.  I recognize neither of them.\n\n‘You fucking killed her!’  It’s all I can say.  I’m drowning in the sadness, unable to keep my head above the water.  I cannot believe that the happiness, the medicated happiness, is to be gone forever.  But most of all I cannot accept that the woman is dead, that she is gone and never to return.  Oh, how quickly things change.\n\n‘Brother, she was not who you thought she was.  I promise you her death is a good thing.’\n\n*A fucking good thing!*  I want to tear his throat out, this man, one of the three who have taken everything from me.  I envisage killing him – killing them all.  I swear to God, if they free me from these straps it will be the last thing that they do.\n\n‘Do you at least want to know where you are, brother?  We have come a long way to help you.  We have been searching for you for so long.’  The third man spoke for the first time, his voice soothing and calm.  Still, I don’t trust him.  I don’t trust them.  \n\nI shook my head furiously, ‘I didn’t need your fucking help!’ I snapped, ‘I was more than fine until you came and ruined everything.’  \n‘But you did, this…’ he waved his hands around the room then back towards me, ‘…is not natural, especially not for you.’\n\nI was in the process of composing myself, fighting the adrenaline brought on by the despair, when an alarm that sounded more like an air raid siren burst into its gruesome song.\n\n‘You said they were all dead?’  One of the unarmed men blurted out in a panic to the one who took my love away from me.\n\n‘Obviously not.’  He said before turning to me, ‘either way, they can’t do anything, so I want you to sit tight, ok, brother?  We’ll have you out of here in no time.’\n\nI know it will be futile to reiterate my objections.  Regardless of how I feel, they have made it clear that they ‘know’ what’s best for me.  So I decide to play along and go with them when the time comes.  An opportunity to kill them will soon arise I’m sure and, when it does, I will not hesitate to take it.  Until then I will keep my emotions at bay, despite the yelling yearning to explode. \n\nI was, however, slightly concerned by who he meant by ‘they’.  I was only familiar with the woman.  I hadn’t set eyes on anyone else during my luxurious stay here.\n\nAs the three men prepare to leave the room the alarm reaches deafening levels.\n\n‘And you’re certain there’s no chance they could send reinforcements?’  \n\n‘Use your brain, Jack.  Think where we are!’\n\nI could see that Jack was ready to open his mouth and respond before thinking against it. \n\n‘You know the drill, brothers.  We’ll check over the station once more.  There can’t be many of them left.’\n\nThey were moving with the utmost precaution as they disappeared into the darkness outside of the door.  I use their absence to focus on exactly where it is that I am (something that I promised myself I wouldn’t do).  Who were the people that they killed?  And what sort of station is this?  I despise myself for beginning to need to know – for doubting the woman – but what if these men *are* here to help me?  I cannot deny myself the chance to discover the truth because I’m frightened to learn that I’ve been lied to.  No matter how much I want to kill them, I at least have to hear their version of events. \n\nIf I am to be strong and overcome the fear that links arms with the prospect of loneliness then I must control my emotions.  I mustn’t let feelings cloud my judgment.\n\nI stare vacantly at the woman’s dead body.  With no choice but to embrace the sensation of unease, I ask her the questions that I have avoided for so long (not that I expect any answers).  *Why were you keeping me here?*  *Why me?* Surely, there can’t be anything extraordinary about me.  But it’s obvious, with such a short burst of thinking one thing is for sure – I wasn’t kept here out of kindness, irrespective of whether or not the doses made it feel that way.  He was right – it isn’t natural to be kept here dosed out of my eyeballs, despite how good it feels.  And if I’m being honest it is that feeling that I will come to miss – that I am already missing – and not the woman.  I breathe a sigh of relief and turn my gaze to the ceiling above me; I am ready to discover the truth – to accept and discover myself.\n",

    "passage": "[]\n\nToday's Best Tech Deals\n\nPicked by Macworld's Editors\n\nTop Deals On Great Products\n\nPicked by Techconnect's Editors\n\n[]\nWhether you have a new iPad, an older iPad, or an iPad mini, consider using a protective case or carrying bag to minimize the risk of damage. True, the sleek design of this tablet family makes you want to show off your iPad, but they are still vulnerable to scratches and scuffs. While we haven’t tested every case and bag on the market, here’s a rundown of the most common types, along with a few good examples of each.\n\n\nShopping tips\n\nThere are hundreds of third-party iPad cases and bags on the market, each specifically made for either the full-sized iPad or the iPad mini. Because the third-and fourth-generation iPad models have the same body size, many cases are made to fit both, but there are a few exceptions. Here are a few things to look for when shopping for iPad protection.\n\nWhen looking at the full-sized iPad line, keep in mind that, apart from the third- and fourth-generation iPads, each iPad model has a slightly different shape from the last. A case or bag made for one model in particular may not fit any other; this is particularly true when it comes to the original iPad. Many cases made for the iPad 2 also fit the third-generation iPad, but not all do. Cases made specifically for the third-generation iPad _should_ also fit the iPad 2 and the newest iPad (the fourth-gen), but there are some exceptions. If you’re not confused enough, here’s another caveat—cases made specifically for the fourth-generation iPad may not be compatible with the third-generation iPad; although they share the same body design, the Lightning port on the fourth-gen model is much smaller than the 30-pin dock-connector port found on the third-gen, so if a case has a cutout on the bottom designed for the Lighting port, it won’t be large enough to fit the older port.\n\nThough this sounds like a lot of information, relax: most cases specify which iPad models they’ll work with on the packaging. If it's not clear whether a particular product fits your iPad, compare the case or bag's specs with Apple’s iPad specifications, ask a store employee, read customer reviews, or e-mail the vendor, to confirm. Because there is only one model of the iPad mini to date, any case designed for the mini will fit _your_ mini, no matter what carrier or version you have.\n\nWhen shopping for a form-fitting case, make sure it doesn’t block the iPad's bottom-mounted speaker and dock-connector or Lightning port; top-mounted headphone jack and microphone; front and back cameras (for all models apart from the original iPad); and buttons and switches—unless, of course, the case is designed so that you take your iPad out of the case to use it.\n\nIf you're shopping for a bag, and you see one that claims to be perfect for both iPads and netbooks, be suspicious. Most of the bags that claim to fit both classes of products end up being a poor fit for the iPad—the iPad is _much_ thinner than the typical netbook and will swim around inside. Same goes for the iPad mini—bags with sleeves designed for the iPad are likely to be too large for the mini and won’t provide a snug enough fit.\n\n\nCase types and recommendations\n\n[]\nApple Smart Cover for iPad mini\nAPPLE SMART COVER: Apple’s in-house protector for the iPad can’t really be called a case—as its name implies, the Smart Cover for the iPad 2 or later (polyurethane, $39; leather, $69) and the iPad mini (polyurethane, $39) is really just a cover, and one that protects only the iPad’s screen at that. But oh, what a clever cover it is, containing a slew of neatly arranged magnets that let the Smart Cover’s hinge attach, perfectly oriented, to the edge of the iPad; adhere to the iPad’s screen; and automatically sleep and wake the iPad when you close and open the cover, respectively. The Smart Cover also rolls up into a triangular shape to act as both a typing stand and a viewing stand. (Note that if you want to use the Smart Cover with another case, make sure the latter leaves room for the Smart Cover to attach to the left-hand side of the iPad.)\n\nApple makes a more-protective option for the full-sized iPad—the Smart Case ($49), which combines a polyurethane shell with a Smart Cover to provide full-body protection.\n\nFor a different look with the same functionality, the Miniot Cover MK2 ($91) is a sleek-looking Smart Cover-esque case made from solid wood.\n\n[]\nX-doria Engage\nSHELLS AND SKINS: Shells and silicone skins generally cover the back and sides of your iPad, but not the screen, offering moderate protection while letting you use the iPad in its case. These cases range from thin, polycarbonate coverings to soft-silicone skins to polycarbonate-and-rubber protection to chunky, molded-grip gaming jackets. Shells and skins are likely to be model-specific, so a skin made for the fourth-generation iPad certainly won’t fit the original iPad and may not fit the iPad 2 or third-generation. Recommendations:\n\n-   X-doria Engage Shell (iPad mini, $20; iPad 2 and newer, $30)\n-   Otterbox Defender Series (iPad mini, $70; iPad 2 and newer, $90)\n-   Cygnett WorkMate (iPad mini, $40)\n\nSLEEVES: Sleeve cases protect your iPad inside another bag, such as a backpack, briefcase, or messenger bag. Some are simple slide-in designs, while others zip closed or sport a flap closure for added security. Most fit all iPad models; make sure it’s designed for the iPad mini if that’s what you need. Recommendations:\n\n-   OnGuard Sleeve (iPad mini, $45; all full-sized iPads, $50)\n-   Rickshaw Bagworks Customized Sleeve (iPad mini, $29-$39; iPad 2 and newer, $39-$49)\n-   Grove Wool Sleeve (iPad mini, $59; all full-sized iPads, $79)\n\n[]\nOnGuard Sleeve\nFOLIO CASES: Folio-style cases offer all-over protection for your iPad, but flip open for easy access to the iPad's screen without requiring you to remove the tablet from the case. If you’re looking for stylish protection, this is it. A folio case made for the original iPad won’t fit the iPad 2 or newer, and vice versa. Folio cases made for the iPad mini will only fit the iPad mini. Recommendations:\n\n-   DODOcase Classic (iPad mini, $60; iPad 2 and newer, $60)\n-   Incase Nylon Portfolio (third- and fourth-generation iPad, $70)\n-   Speck FitFolio (iPad mini, $35; iPad 2 and newer, $40)\n\n[]\nDODOcase Classic\nBAGS: A bag lets you carry your iPad along with your other gear, and you can use it to tote your daily stuff even when you aren’t carrying your iPad with you. Bags generally fit all models of the iPad; consider an extra case for your iPad mini for a snug fit. Recommendations:\n\n-   Brenthaven Prostyle Courier (all full-sized iPads, $70)\n-   Booq Cobra Courier XS (all full-sized iPads, $145)\n-   Hex Drake iPad Bag (all full-sized iPads, $40)\n\n[]\nBrenthaven Prostyle Courier\nCARRYING PACKS: Sometimes you want to carry more than just your iPad, but you don’t want a bulky bag or backpack. A carrying pack protects your iPad but also accommodates cables, a charger, and sometimes even a standalone Bluetooth keyboard. Most carrying packs will accommodate all generations of the full-sized iPad; again, look for a pack optimized for the iPad mini if that’s the device you’re shopping for. Recommendations:\n\n-   STM Jacket D7 (iPad mini, $25)\n-   Mujjo iPad Sleeve (iPad mini, $58; any full-sized iPad, $64)\n-   WaterField Designs iPad Wallet (iPad 2 and newer, $79) and iPad Travel Express (third- and fourth-generation iPad, starts at $69; iPad mini, $59)\n\n[]\nSTM Jacket D7\n[]\nWrapsol Back Films plus screen protector\nBODY FILMS:Body films protect the sides and backside of your iPad from scratches and scuffswithout adding bulk—they’re simply a thin layer of super-protective material that adheres directly to the iPad. Most types can be removed without leaving behind sticky residue. Some also include a screen film (see the next section). Although the models listed here are for the third- and fourth-generation iPads, each is also available in a version for each of the other iPad models and the iPad mini. Recommendations:\n\n-   BodyGuardz UltraTough Clear Skins ($30)\n-   Zagg Invisible Shield ($40)\n-   Wrapsol Back Films ($30)\n\n[]\nBodyGuardz ScreenGuardz\nSCREEN FILMS:Screen films are designed to protect the iPad’s screen from scratches without affecting touchscreen performance; a few also aim to reduce screen glare. Unfortunately, many of these films are difficult to apply, and some actually make glare and fingerprints worse. If you’re patient and have a steady hand, these are the best options. Recommendations:\n\n-   BodyGuardz ScreenGuardz ($20 for screen film only, $30 bundled with body film)\n-   Moshi iVisor ($30)\n-   Zagg Invisible Shield ($30 for screen film only, $40 bundled with body film)\n\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

Trophy Rating is only comparable within the same species - there's no point in comparing a white-tailed jackrabbit Trophy Rating to that of a blacktail deer.\n\nTrophy Rating generally determines the medal you get when harvesting an animal:\n\n-   if the animal has no trophy organ (for example female deer species), then the medal is NONE\n-   if the Trophy Rating is lower than 20% of the animal's maximum TR, then the medal is BRONZE\n-   if the Trophy Rating is between 20% and below 60% of the animal's maximum TR, then the medal is SILVER\n-   if the Trophy Rating is between 60% and below 90% of the animal's maximum TR, then the medal is GOLD\n-   if the Trophy Rating is 90% of the animal's maximum TR or higher, then the medal is DIAMOND\n-   GREAT ONE is the highest medal rating. This class is extremely rare and has some unusual characteristics, also reflected in a trophy rating score that is far outside the usual range.\n\n-   1 Harvest Check\n-   2 Bonuses\n    -   2.1 Quick Kill Bonus\n    -   2.2 Consecutive Harvests Bonus\n-   3 Difficulty\n-   4 Trophy Type and Trophy Rating\n-   5 Session Score\n\n\nHarvest Check[edit | edit source]\n\nHarvest Check determines whether the animal was downed ethically and effectively. If Harvest Check is failed, the medal is lowered by 1 level (so potential Diamond becomes Gold, potential Gold becomes Silver and so on).\n\nTo pass the Harvest Check, you need to meet these 4 conditions:\n\n-   correct ammo class must be used: every animal in the game falls into a specific Animal Class - for example White-tailed Jackrabbit is class 1, Blacktail Deer is class 4 and so on; every ammo can be used on a number of classes - for example .243 can be used on classes 2 through 6; that means you can use .243 to down a Blacktail Deer (class 4) but not a Jackrabbit (class 1)\n-   animal must be downed with 1 or 2 shots: you can't expect to shoot the animal 8 times and still get the highest possible rewards, so make sure to aim for vital organs\n-   animal's trophy organ must be intact - trophy organs are typically antlers, horns, or skull, so avoid shooting the animal in the head to pass this check\n-   hit a vital organ - this is to ensure the shots are ethical and the animal dies as quickly as possible; aim for a heart, lung, liver, neck, or brain to pass this check; note that damaging the brain usually means damaging the skull and failing the \"trophy organ must be intact\" requirement. Spinal cord shots are considered unethical, even though in the game they make the animal die very quickly. Lastly, this check is passed automatically in case of small game, such as Jackrabbits or Mallards\n\n\nBonuses[edit | edit source]\n\nFor each harvest, you can get additional XP and cash rewards through 2 bonuses:\n\nQuick Kill Bonus[edit | edit source]\n\nThe bonus is based on the time an animal takes to die after the hit. The shorter the time, the higher the bonus gets.\n\n-   Minimum: 0% - The animal dies after a long period of time from bleeding out, usually due to poor shot placement.\n-   Maximum: 100% - The animal dies on the spot or runs a few meters away from the spot of being shot\n\nConsecutive Harvests Bonus[edit | edit source]\n\nThis bonus merely indicates that all animals that were killed were also harvested. It requires 5 consecutive harvests to get the maximum monetary reward of a kill. If one animal, that was killed, was not harvested if the game was exited, this bonus falls to 0%.\n\n-   1st harvest - 20%\n-   2nd harvest - 40%\n-   3rd harvest - 60%\n-   4th harvest - 80%\n-   5th harvest - 100%\n\n\nDifficulty[edit | edit source]\n\nThe DIFFICULTY reflects how \"big\" the animal is in terms of TROPHY RATING and how aware the animal is of its environment. This means that at higher Difficulty level, the animal will pose a bigger challenge to hunt and will require more skill to call and stalk. The MINIMUM DIFFICULTY for all Species is 1 - Trivial and the MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY can vary depending on the species. Every difficulty has a range of Trophy Rating values.\n\n1 - Trivial\n\n2 - Minor\n\n3 - Very easy\n\n4 - Easy\n\n5 - Medium\n\n6 - Hard\n\n7 - Very hard\n\n8 - Mythical\n\n9 - Legendary\n\n10 - Fabled (only Great Ones)\n\nAnimal\nLevel\nTurkey\n1-3 (Very Easy)\nMallard\nCinnamon Teal\nHarlequin Duck\nScrub Hare\nJackrabbit\nEuropean Hare\nMusk Deer\nRoe Deer\nWhitetail Deer *\nMountain Goat\n1-5 (Medium)\nBighorn Sheep\nPronghorn\nRocky Mountain Elk\nLesser Kudu\nWarthog\nSpringbok\nGemsbok\nWild Boar\nReindeer\nBlue Wildebeest\nRoosevelt Elk\nMoose\nBison\nPlains Bison\nCaribou\nIberian Mouflon\nBeceite Ibex\nRonda Ibex\nGredos Ibex\nSoutheastern Spanish Ibex\nAxis Deer\nMule Deer\nBlackbuck\nFallow Deer\nBlacktail Deer\nCanada Goose\nCape Buffalo\n1-9 (Legendary)\nWater Buffalo\nRed Deer\nBlack Bear\nBrown Bear\nGrizzly Bear\nGray Wolf\nIberian Wolf\nRed Fox\nCoyote\nSide-Striped Jackal\nEurasian Lynx\nPuma\nMountain Lion\nLion\n* Whitetail Deer exist as Great Ones with Difficulty Level 'Fabled'\n\n\nTrophy Type and Trophy Rating[edit | edit source]\n\nTrophy Type is an specific characteristic of the Species (Weight, Skull Size, Antlers, Horns, Tusks) on which the Trophy Rating (TR) will be based on. The Trophy Rating is a value given to the size/weight of the trophy; thus, a larger trophy gives you a higher rating. The trophy rating provides at maximum 500 Kill Score.\n\nAnimal\nTrophy Type\nMinimum TR\nMaximum TR\nCanada Goose\nWeight\n3,2\n9,2\nMallard\n0,7\n2,1\nScrub Hare\n1,5\n5,8\nJackrabbit\n1,9\n6,8\nSide-Striped Jackal\n13,2\n30,9\nRed Fox\n2\n15,4\nLynx\n16,0\n29,0\nCoyote\n33\n59\nEuropean Hare\n2\n7\nHarlequin Duck\n??\n??\nCinnamon Teal\n0.3\n0.5\nMusk Deer\nFangs\n0\n276\nRoe Deer\nAntlers\n0\n277\nSpringbok\n57\n116\nFallow Deer\n0\n237\nBlacktail Deer\n0\n210\nWhitetail Deer *\n0\n213\nLesser Kudu\n0\n35,0\nWarthog\nTusks\n15\n63\nWild Boar\n7\n159\nBlack Bear\nSkull\n12,0\n24,0\nBrown Bear\n16,0\n29,0\nGrizzly Bear\n??\n??\nPuma\n30\n40\nLion\n35\n50\nGray Wolf\n??\n??\nIberian Wolf\n30\n40\nRed Deer\nAntlers\n0\n276\nBlue Wildebeest\n17,0\n40,0\nRoosevelt Elk\n0\n404\nMoose\n0\n245\nReindeer\n65\n904\nCaribou\n??\n??\nMule Deer\n0\n550\nAxis Deer\n0\n389\nBison\nHorns\n4\n300\nPlains Bison\n??\n??\nCape Buffalo\n51\n162\nWater Buffalo\n154\n358\nBlackbuck\n17.5\n29.5\nIberian Mouflon\n??\n??\nGredos Ibex\n??\n??\nBeceite Ibex\n??\n??\nRonda Ibex\n??\n??\nSoutheastern Spanish Ibex\n??\n??\nTurkey\nCombined\n??\n??\n* Whitetail Deer exist as Great Ones with a much higher Trophy Rating\n\n\nSession Score[edit | edit source]\n\nThe SESSION SCORE is the final rating of the harvest and it's a combination of the medal, animal's difficulty, harvest check and the quick kill bonus. The Session Score ranges between 0 and 1000, though only animals with highest difficulty can score 1000. Note that this \"difficulty\" is different from the one described above, and it ranges between 0 and 100%.\n\nThe exact score calculation and bonuses can be found in the Harvest Screen by mouse-overing the scores.\n\n_SPECIAL THANKS TO \"RIZKZ\"FOR THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RATING SYSTEM_\n",

    "passage": "December 30, 2017\n_—\\ You\\ can\\ find\\ the\\ source\\ code\\ for\\ this\\ blog\\ series\\ here._\n\n[header]\n\nOver the last several months, I’ve been looking for ways to produce _physical_ outputs from my generative code. I’m interested in the idea of developing real, tangible objects that are no longer bound by the generative systems that shaped them. Eventually I plan to experiment with 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC milling, and other ways of realizing my algorithms in the real-world.\n\nMy interest in this began in March 2017, when I purchased my first pen plotter: the AxiDraw V3 by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories. It’s a fantastic machine, and has opened a whole new world of thinking for me. For those unaware, a pen plotter is a piece of hardware that acts like a robotic arm on which you can attach a regular pen. Software sends commands to the device to raise, reposition, and lower its arm across a 2D surface. With this, the plotter can be programmed to produce intricate and accurate prints with a pen and paper of your choice.\n\n[plotter-wide]\n\n_—\\ Early\\ prints,\\ March\\ 2017_\n\nUnlike a typical printer, a plotter produces prints with a strangely human quality: occasional imperfections arise as the pen catches an edge or momentarily dries up, and the quality of the ink has the subtle texture and emboss that you normally only see in an original drawing.\n\n  🖨 Plotters have been around for a while — if you are just starting off, you might be interested in some of the older but more affordable HP plotters.\n\nOften, these plotters and mechanical devices are controlled by formats like HP-GL or G-code. These formats that specify how the machine should lift, move, and place itself over time. For convenience, AxiDraw handles most of the mechanical operation for you, providing an Inkscape SVG plugin that accepts paths, lines, shapes, and even fills (through hatching).\n\n[plotter-wide]\n\n_—\\ Tesselations,\\ August\\ 2017_\n\nYou don’t need to be a programmer to use the AxiDraw pen plotter. You can create SVG files in Adobe Illustrator or find SVGs online to print. However, the machine is very well suited to programmatic and algorithmic line art, as it can run for hours at a time and produce incredibly detailed outputs that would be too tedious to illustrate by hand.\n\nOne recent series I developed, _Natural Systems_, is composed of 4 different algorithms. Each time these algorithms run, they produce different outputs, allowing for an infinite number of unique prints.\n\n[natural1]\n\n_—\\ Natural\\ Systems,\\ November\\ 2017_\n\nThis isn’t a new concept; Vera Molnár, an early pioneer of computer art, was rendering pen plotter prints in the 1960s!\n\n[molnar]\n\n_—\\ Vera\\ Molnár,\\ No\\ Title,\\ 1968_\n\nIn this post, I’ll try to explain some of my workflow when developing new pen plotter prints, and show some of the tools I’ve been building to help organize my process.\n\nSo far, all of my work with the AxiDraw has been with JavaScript and an experimental tool I’ve been building, aptly named penplot. The tool primarily acts as a development environment, making it easier to organize and develop new prints with minimal configuration.\n\n  💡 This tool has recently evolved into a more mature framework called canvas-sketch.\n\nYou can try the tool out yourself with node@8.4.x and npm@5.3.x or higher.\n\n    # install the CLI app globally\n    npm install penplot -g\n\n    # run it, generating a new file and opening the browser\n    penplot test-print.js --write --open\n\nThe --write flag will generate a new test-print.js file and --open will launch your browser to localhost:9966. It starts you off with a basic print:\n\n[penplot]\n\n✏️\\ See\\ here\\ to\\ see\\ the\\ generated\\ source\\ code\\ of\\ this\\ print.\n\nThe generated test-print.js file is ready to go; you can edit the ES2015 code to see changes reflected in your browser. When you are happy, hit Cmd + S (save PNG) or Cmd + P (save SVG) to export your print from the browser — the files will save to your Downloads folder.\n\nFor algorithmic work with AxiDraw and its SVG plugin, I tend to distill all my visuals into a series of polylines composed of nested arrays.\n\n    const lines = [\n      [\n        [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ]\n      ],\n      [\n        [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 2 ]\n      ]\n    ]\n\nThis creates two horizontal lines in the top left of our print, each 1 cm wide. Here, points are defined by [ x, y ] and a polyline (i.e. path) is defined by the points [ a, b, c, d, .... ]. Our list of polylines is defined as [ A, B, ... ], allowing us to create multiple disconnected segments (i.e. where the pen lifts to create a new line).\n\n  📐 Penplot scales the Canvas2D context before drawing, so all of your units should be in centimeters.\n\n[code]\n\nSo far, the code above doesn’t feel very intuitive, but you will hardly ever hardcode coordinates like this. Instead, you should try to think in geometric primitives: points, squares, lines, circles, triangles, etc. For example, to draw some squares in the centre of the print:\n\n    // Function to create a square\n    const square = (x, y, size) => {\n      // Define rectangle vertices\n      const path = [\n        [ x - size, y - size ],\n        [ x + size, y - size ],\n        [ x + size, y + size ],\n        [ x - size, y + size ]\n      ];\n      // Close the path\n      path.push(path[0]);\n      return path;\n    };\n\n    // Get centre of the print\n    const cx = width / 2;\n    const cy = height / 2;\n\n    // Create 12 concentric pairs of squares\n    const lines = [];\n    for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) {\n      const size = i + 1;\n      const margin = 0.25;\n      lines.push(square(cx, cy, size));\n      lines.push(square(cx, cy, size + margin));\n    }\n\nOnce the lines are in place, they are easy to render to the Canvas2D context with beginPath() and stroke(), or save to an SVG with the penplot utility, polylinesToSVG().\n\nThe result of our code looks like this:\n\n[squares]\n\n✏️\\ See\\ here\\ for\\ the\\ final\\ source\\ code\\ of\\ this\\ print.\n\nThis is starting to get a bit more interesting, but you may be wondering why not just reproduce this by hand in Illustrator. So, let’s see if we can create something more complex in code.\n\nA simple starting task would be to explore Delaunay triangulation. For this, we will use delaunay-triangulate, a robust triangulation library by Mikola Lysenko that works in 2D and 3D. We will also use the new-array module, a simple array creation utility.\n\nBefore we begin, you’ll need to install these dependencies locally:\n\n    # first ensure you have a package.json in your folder\n    npm init -y\n\n    # now you can install the required dependencies\n    npm install delaunay-triangulate new-array\n\nIn our JavaScript code, let’s import some of our modules and define a set of 2D points randomly distributed across the print, inset by a small margin.\n\nWe use the built-in penplot random library here, which has the function randomFloat(min, max) for convenience.\n\n    import newArray from 'new-array';\n    import { randomFloat } from 'penplot/util/random';\n\n    // ...\n\n    const pointCount = 200;\n    const positions = newArray(pointCount).map(() => {\n      // Margin from print edge in centimeters\n      const margin = 2;\n      // Return a random 2D point inset by this margin\n      return [\n        randomFloat(margin, width - margin),\n        randomFloat(margin, height - margin)\n      ];\n    });\n\n  💡 I often use new-array and map to create a list of objects, as I find it more modular and functional than a for loop.\n\nIf we were to visualize our points as circles, it might look like this:\n\n[code]\n\nThe next step is to triangulate these points, i.e. turn them into triangles. Simply feed the array of points into the triangulate function and it returns a list of “cells.”\n\n    import triangulate from 'delaunay-triangulate';\n\n    // ...\n\n    const cells = triangulate(positions);\n\nThe return value is an array of triangles, but instead of giving us the 2D positions of each vertex in the triangle, it gives us the index into the positions array that we passed in.\n\n    [\n      [ 0, 1, 2 ],\n      [ 2, 3, 4 ],\n      ...\n    ]\n\nFor example, to get the 3 vertices of the first triangle:\n\n    const triangle = cells[0].map(i => positions[i]);\n\n    // log each 2D point in the triangle\n    console.log(triangle[0], triangle[1], triangle[2]);\n\nFor our final print, we want to map each triangle to a polyline that the pen plotter can draw out.\n\n    const lines = cells.map(cell => {\n      // Get vertices for this cell\n      const triangle = cell.map(i => positions[i]);\n      // Close the path\n      triangle.push(triangle[0]);\n      return triangle;\n    });\n\nNow we have all the lines we need to send the SVG to AxiDraw. In the browser, hit Cmd + S and Cmd + P to save a PNG and SVG file, respectively, into your Downloads folder.\n\n[triangles]\n\nFor reference, below you can see how our original random points have now become the vertices for each triangle:\n\n[code]\n\n  💡 The random module includes a setSeed(n) function, which is useful if you want predictable randomness every time the page reloads.\n\nIf we increase the pointCount to a higher value, we start to get a more well-defined edge, and potentially a more interesting print.\n\n[code]\n\n✏️\\ See\\ here\\ for\\ the\\ final\\ source\\ code\\ of\\ this\\ print.\n\nIn the next instalment of this series, we’ll attempt to reproduce a fracturing algorithm for a more interesting composition.\n\nCONTINUE READING: Pen Plotter Art & Algorithms, Part 2\n\n557\n\nKudos\n\n557\n\nKudos\n",

    "passage": "Aspect- A Short Story\n\n                                           Aspect: A Short Story\nAs they made their way out of town the sky opened up and a light drizzle began to spatter the windshield. \n\"Awesome. 40 degrees and raining. My kind of day,\" chirped Joe from the passenger seat. \nWill shivered. \n\"Hey what's this?\" \nJoe was holding up a letter. Will snatched it from his hand. \n\"Relax! Who do you know in Boston anyway?\" \n       Will looked away. He knew Joe worked best when he was left in the dark.\nThe particular farm they were headed to today was owned by a man named Wilson Tucker. Both men had worked odd jobs for him in the past and Will respected him immensely. \nMr. Tucker was a widower with a grown son who had no interest in the workings of a farm. He must have been a man of sixty, but he could outwork a man half his age and twice his size. Which just so happened to describe Joe... Joe had a different opinion of the man.\n\"Why are we doing this? I thought you said we were done with the grunt work. This is your big plan?\" \nWill flicked on the radio.\nThere was something comforting in listening to his fellow citizens ripping into the Sox for stumbling through yet another post-season. A tragic story told for the hundredth time. The host was trying to explain to a caller that the pitching was the problem. The caller held the opposing view, that offense was what this team needed, pitching was the least of their concerns. Will considered the conflict.\n\"This guy's an idiot!\" squawked Joe. \nWill had forgotten he was there.\n\"Which one?\" Joe furrowed his brow and took a long drag from his cigarette. \n\" The host! How do you expect to win if you don't score?\" \nWill flicked the radio off.\nHe eased on the accelerator as he manuevered up the long road to their destination. Tucker Farm was situated in the shadow of Mt. Brentman, on the North side. When Mr. Tucker bought the land he was led to believe that the state was going to build a new road that would cut through the pass and connect his land with Route 22. When the project was scrapped, people privately laughed at him for buying such a useless plot of land. Mr. Tucker never said a word, he simply built his own road. Perhaps more of a trail than a road. But if you had four wheel drive and weren't afraid of heights, it was an amazing example of determination. Will couldn't help but admire the man. \n\"Son of a bitch!\" \nWill had been day-dreaming with his foot on the gas and hit a particularly bad pot hole at 25mph and the rest of Joe's coffee was now soaking into his lap. Will winced at the sound of metal on metal as he pressed on the brake. \n\"I'm gonna make sure the trucks alright.\" \nJoe was wiping the last of his precious coffee from the trucks armrest when Will reappeared at the window. \n\"You know how lucky we are? Come look at this.\" \nAs the pair approached the alleged pot-hole, it wasn't a pot-hole at all, but a 3-foot wide fissure running straight through the road with a 200 foot drop straight down the side of the mountain. It was invisible until you were almost right on top of it. \n\"Holy shit!\" \nJoe was leaning far out over the abyss to get a better view. The rain was coming down harder now. \n\"Get away from there! Look at it. Its crumbling. If I wasn't going so fast we woulda...\" \nJoe was kicking at the edges of the rift. \n\"Remember the time that miserable old bastard nearly ripped me outta my truck when I broke his 5mph speed limit? Ha! It's a good thing you got a lead foot or we'd be lyin' at the bottom of that hill right now!\" \nMr. Tucker was what you would call an eccentric man. His land was riddled with projects in various stages of completion or disrepair, depending on your perspective. As a symbol to his unique personality, in the southwest corner, at the top of a small hill overlooking his home-made road, sat an exact replica of his farmhouse at 1/6 scale. Any visitor lucky enough to survive the winding trail was greeted by the welcome sight of a house off in the distance. Upon closing the gap on this mirage and passing by what amounted to a playhouse, they were astonished to find the same view they had seen minutes earlier. Only this time it was no mirage but his actual house, on a hill, off in the distance. If this confounding sense of humor wasnt enough to dissuade you from venturing further, Mr. Tucker assumed you had a good reason to be there. \nTucker Farm itself consisted of nothing more than a farmhouse in the middle of a large overgrown field. Nothing had grown there in the 20 odd years since his wife died and his son moved away. But Mr. Tucker was fiercely protective of his land and wouldn't move for anything. He was made several lucrative offers over the years and refused them all. Responding to them all the same way in neatly written cursive. \n\"You can have my land when I'm dead. Until then, please leave me alone.\" \nIt was well known that his land happened to sit in the path of a proposed super-highway that, if ever approved, would see the owner of the land profit very handsomely. As Will pulled up to the house he wondered how this lonely piece of land could possibly mean that much to anyone.\nMr. Tucker was waiting in the doorway when they reached the front steps. \n\"William! How are ya my boy!?\" \nWill reminded Mr. Tucker of his son, he had told him so on several occasions. The junior Tucker was a big shot lawyer down in Boston and didn't have time to tramp through the forest to visit his old man. It had been three years since he had seen his son and you could see the fatherly affection glint in his eyes when he shook Wills hand.\n\"I've been well Mr. Tucker. How are you?\" \nJoe kicked the ground and stared at his feet. \n\"And you! Are you ready to work this time? You're not gonna fall apart on me again are ya?\" \tFire danced in Joes eyes. \n\"You might wanna worry less about me and more about...\" \nWill cut him off.\n\"So I see you've been busy around here lately. The house looks great, did you paint the whole thing yourself?\" \nMr. Tucker was glaring at Joe. \n\"Of course I did! I might be old but I'm not useless yet.\" \nJoe was about to ask if he meant to leave all those bare patches but he felt Will's eyes on him and bit his tongue.\n\"Well, c'mon in. Have some breakfast before it gets cold.\" \nJoe hesitated, looked at Will for the OK, then bolted inside. \nMr. Tucker was a gracious host even when the company was being paid to be there and he always made sure his employees were properly fed before starting the workday. It was the only reason Joe even agreed to come on this job. \n\"If you can guarantee me breakfast, I'll go,\" were his exact words when Will offered. And now he was taking full advantage of his perceived right. Several times Will had to kick him under the table to stop him from taking seconds or thirds.\nAfter the meal they stepped out onto the deck overlooking the stacks of timber they were supposed to cut, split and stack. \n\"Well, there you go. Have at it.\" said Mr. Tucker as he lit his pipe. \nThere was something charming about an old farmer smoking his pipe that made Will smile. \n\"What? You're gonna sit up here and supervise,\" apparently Joe wasnt convinced of his charm. \tWill prodded Joe towards the stairs. \n\"You're Goddamn right im gonna supervise! That wood is the only thing that keeps me from freezing come winter. You think I'd let a knucklehead like you be responsible for my well being? Ha!\" \tJoe had stopped listening and was already down the stairs cursing the old man with every foul word he could think of. \n\"Will, you're gonna watch him right? I have to go into town for awhile and I don't need him cutting his arm off or God knows what else while I'm gone. I can trust you right?\" \nWill could feel the weight in his words as they came out. I can trust you right? Will felt his pulse quicken as if this was the most important question he'd ever been asked. \n\"Of course. It'll be fine. No need to worry.\" \nThe words came out automatically. \n\"Will, can I tell you something?\" \nWill felt faint. \n\"I'm going through with it. I'm gonna sell this place. I'm not letting my son get his hands on it, the greedy bastard. It's too bad he's not more like you.\" \nSeveral thoughts ran through Will's head. \nMr. Tucker looked up at the clouds roiling overhead and let out a low whistle.\n\"It's gonna get worse before it gets better. How was the road coming in?\" \nWill pondered the question and a small smile began to show at the corner of his mouth. \n\" A bit treacherous, just remember to take it slow.\" \nHe knew Mr. Tucker would appreciate the humor.\n",

    "passage": "[RF] And The Lights Came On\n\nIt was dark, not late, but dark. I looked over at the clock that hung above the side door in the kitchen, I strained to see it since the only light in the room emanated from the TV, constantly changing with every scene.\nI walked into the kitchen and saw the microwave time said ‘8:04’, I turned my head and looked at the oven clock, which read ‘7:04’. I didn’t know which one was right so I flicked the light switch on, the bulb lit up for a second before popping and turning the room dark again. I flicked the light switch back off and stood for a moment.\n\tI forgot about the time and opened the cupboard underneath the sink, where we kept spare light bulbs, and took the right one out and checked it was fine. I carried a chair over from the dining table over to the kitchen and placed it underneath the blown bulb. I can do it without the chair, I thought, but the lampshade is fidly, even in the daytime. I struggled with the lampshade, while trying to be quiet, as not to wake the baby who I’d left to sleep on the couch. I replaced the bulb and lampshade and then carried the chair back to the dining table and slid it into its space.\n\tI flicked the light switch and the bulb lit up, letting me read the clock, which now read ‘7:06’. I heard the baby cooing and thought I should turn the light off and go back to the couch, to comfort him.\n\nThe baby was nearing three months old and usually gave no problems during the night. I left him to sleep next to me on the couch since he’d wake when I picked him up, he wasn’t usually like this. On a normal night he could be taken to his bed and put to sleep there without a problem. Maybe it’s because I’m the one doing it and not his mother.\n\tA part of me isn’t yet comfortable around him. whenever he looks at me I don’t see a son, I see a baby. My Wife is enamored with him, “Isn’t he beautiful?”, she’d say. I’d agree with her despite thinking he looked like every other baby I’ve seen before.\nI stood over the couch, looking down at him, thinking about my wife.\n\nThe room was quiet, I heard the refrigerator humming and the room got brighter. I forgot where the glowing light came from, I turned to its source and remembered I had the TV on. It was on silent, that’s why I didn’t hear it. I took a seat in the middle of the couch, next to the baby, and fiddled with the remote for a minute until I found the subtitles option, I turned them on and read as I let the baby grip the index finger of my right hand. He began to make more noises which progressively got louder and louder.\n“Hey now little one,” I said. “It’s all right, Mama will be home soon, I’m sure of that.”\nHis little blue eyes stared back at me and seemed to glow a little from the TV light. He let go of my finger and started to wriggle around. I leant down and picked him up, cradling him in my arms. The smell that he gave off was not one I enjoyed, my Wife and everybody else who’d held him disagreed. He made another cooing sound, I was sure he was about to cry.\nI stood up with baby in my arms and headed back into the kitchen, where I got a bottle of milk out of the fridge and put it in the microwave.\nI looked out of the kitchen window at the front lawn and the street. I’d cut the grass two days prior and noticed a bit I’d missed, then I saw a line of garbage cans at the end of driveways all down the street. Ours was missing from the driveway as it was still parked up against the side of the garage, waiting to be walked down. That’ll have to wait ‘til my wife gets home, I can’t leave the baby alone in the house and I can’t take the garbage out with him in my arms.\nI saw a light come on in the kitchen of my neighbors home across the street. I saw the silhouette of a man moping around the kitchen, the silhouette stopped in front of the window, in much the same position as myself. The curtains twitched slightly before being pulled to the side a little. I saw his face peering out into the street, across his lawn, across everybody elses. He lifted his eyes and scanned the front of the houses and stopped when he got to our house, I think he saw me but I stayed still so he wouldn’t think I was there. He let go of the curtains and the silhouette walked away, then the light went out.\nThe baby kicked his leg out and hit my bicep. I looked down at him in my arms and he was blinking slowly.\n“What were we doing?” I asked him. “You’re not gonna to be much help.” I said.\nI remembered the microwave. I turned and looked at it, the timer had stopped and beeped without me knowing. Then I remembered what my wife said\n\t“Don’t put the milk in the microwave, it’s no good.”\n\tI took the milk from the microwave and left it on the side. The baby was falling asleep again. I’m not even sure if he wanted milk. I don’t think I’d ever be able to raise this baby by myself.\n\tI walked to the baby’s room and put him down in his cot, I sat for a moment in a rocking chair by the window to see if he’d settle or wake up. I refrained from rocking as the chair would occasionally knock into the wall behind and echo through the room, that would surely wake the baby, I thought. That’s a job I need to add to my list, find a new place for the chair or put something on the wall to stop it knocking.\n\tMy thoughts were interrupted by the shine of car headlights reflecting off our neighbors windows and onto my face, the light only comes in that way if someone is pulling onto our drive. My Wife is home at last. I didn’t get up and open the door, I just waited in the rocking chair. I heard the door open and the sound of my Wifes keys jangling around in her hand until the cacophony of metal as she dropped them into the bowl we keep keys in. I heard her handbag drop onto the couch and after that came footsteps which got louder and louder. I got up and took a step out of the doorway where I saw my Wife walking towards me.\n\t“Baby alright?” She asked.\n\t“Fine,” I whispered “Just put him in his bed.”\n\tShe kissed me on the cheek and rubbed her right hand on my chest as she passed me and went into the baby’s room. She leant over the crib and looked down at the baby, she stood back up and walked over to me.\n\t“Any problems?”\n\t“I put some milk in the microwave, I forgot I shouldn’t.”\n\tShe looked up at me and began to walk to our bedroom.\n\t“That’s fine, where is it?”\n\t“I left it out on the side, to cool down. I didn’t know what to do with it after.”\n\t“I’ll take care of it,” She said. “Why’s the TV on silent?”\n\t“I didn’t want to wake the baby.” I began to wander back to the living room, where the TV still emanated its glowing light. “The grass.” I murmured to myself.\n\t“What?” My Wife called out.\n\t“Nothing.”\n\n\tIn the living room I turned the TV off and turned the light on in the kitchen. I moved the bottle of warm milk into the sink. I unlocked the side door and walked outside, I’d forgotten to put shoes on, but the ground was warm and smooth so I wasn’t bothered much.\n\tI made my way to the back of the house, where our garage and garden were. The side door of the garage was unlocked and I made a mental note to lock it. Inside the garage I pulled the lawn mower out, still grassy from when I previously used it, I left a trail of grass cuttings on the concrete floor.\n\tOn the front lawn I unraveled the cord and walked the plug to the side of the house where we had an outside socket. I plugged it in and walked back to the lawn mower.\n\tThe light from my kitchen illuminated our lawn and the piece of grass I’d missed. I was reminded by the row of trashcans that I had still neglected to put ours out. I walked back up to the side of the garage to where we kept the trashcan and wheeled it down to the end of the driveway. The pattern of trash cans was complete on our street, every single one was out and at the end of the drive.\n\tI moved the lawnmower over to the patch of grass I’d missed, not ontop of it but in front of it. I pulled the lever on the handle and the mower came to life, whirring and vibrating, the sounds bounced down the street and came back to me. I moved the mower over the uncut grass a couple times and after I checked it was cut I moved to the edge of the grass, to make sure it was neat.\n\tA light came on in the house next door and the front door opened. My neighbor, a man in his fifties, came out in his pyjamas, he had a look on his face that was a cross between anger and confusion. He walked over and onto my driveway. I let go of the lawnmower lever and it came to a halt.\n\t“What the hell are ya doin’?” My Neighbor asked.\n\t“I missed a spot.” I said, motioning to the freshly cut grass.\n\t“It’s nighttime.”\n\t“It is dark.” I said, looking up at the clear sky.\n\t“Yeah, it’s late.”\n\t“I guess it is.”\n\t“It is.”\n\t“Okay.”\n\tMy neighbor looked at me, at the lawnmower, and then at the grass.\n\t“Why are you doing this now?”\n\t“Because I missed a spot.” I said, again motioning to the lawn.\n\t“But why couldn’t you do it in the daytime?”\n\t“Because I can’t do it with the baby, I need to keep an eye on the baby.”\n\t“Yeah, I forgot about your kid.” He brought his hands to his hips and sighed a little “How is he?”\n\tThe Neighbor seemed more relaxed now.\n\t“He’s finally sleeping. He’s been up all day. He didn’t sleep much last night.”\n\t“You’re tired, Joe.” He said to me. He gave me the same look my father gave me when I did something wrong. “Go back inside and get some sleep.”\n\tI looked at the lawnmower and the grass.\n\t“The grass can wait ‘til tomorrow.” He said.\n\t“I guess it can.”\n\t“Goodnight, Joe.” He started walking back towards his front door.\n\t“Night, Phil.”\n\t\nI unplugged the lawnmower and wound the cord up. I pulled the mower back up the drive, leaving a new trail of grass back to the garage, where I returned the mower. I went back inside the house, turned the kitchen light off and went into our bedroom, where my Wife was sitting on the bed.\n\t“What was that noise? Was someone mowing their lawn?”\n\t“Yes,” I said. “I was.”\n\t“Why on earth were you mowing the lawn? It’s night time.”\n\t“Because I missed a spot.” I said.\n\nI went to sleep and didn’t wake until eleven hours had passed.",

    "passage": "I’ve seen this question, or variations of it pop up multiple times over in the Crunchyroll forums and elsewhere on the internet:\n\n_I like anime but my [mom, dad, girlfriend, friend, etc.] has never watched anime before. What should I show them?_\n\n[Should You Show Them SAO?]\n\nShould You Show Them SAO?\n\nMy goal in this post is to lay out a number of anime in different genres in order to provide a two-wave guide on how to introduce someone new to the anime genre.\n\nAlthough this is a multi-layered question that somewhat depends on the person who hasn’t watched anime before  (how open minded they are, etc.), quality will still never be beat. The shows that are good are good and the shows that are bad are bad. But to just start with the absolute best of the best anime has to offer isn’t necessarily the way to go. The main access barrier to anime is adjusting to and becoming comfortable with the different tropes that populate pretty much every anime show. For example, my parents struggled to understand why characters’ heads would pop up in little bubbles on the screen to talk. I tried to explain the function of the trope, but really it was something that they needed to learn for themselves.\n\nAnother barrier to introducing people to anime is the preconceptions that people have about it. Most significantly, 1) the mistake assumption that it is only for kids and 2) the portrayal of sexual content. And while both of these concerns have some basis in reality, the best course of action is to find shows that are mature and steer mostly away from fanservice/sexual content and use those as an introduction. The list is a conglomeration of shows I believe to be strong introduction shows to the medium, shows I’ve used in the past to introduce people to the medium, and shows with which I’ve had success introducing people to anime. So, without further delay, let me present my guide to introducing first timers to anime.\n\nThe first wave is a short list of anime shows, all generally of high quality, that are easily accessible to a first time viewer. They contain themes and stories familiar to a Western audience, avoid fanservice tropes as much as possible, and introduce other anime tropes while keeping those tropes from overtaking the viewing experience. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS KEEP GENRE PREFERENCES IN MIND.\n\n1. _Gingitsune: Fox Messenger of the Gods _(Crunchyroll)\n\nGENRE: Slice of Life[Gingitsune Poster]\n\nWHY: _Gingitsune_ is my number one recommendation for introducing people to anime. It provides a lens into Japanese culture and religion, contains no fanservice, is heart-warming and family oriented, with just enough fantasy elements to make it different from any Western family genre._ _Add in a little humor, and _Gingitsune_ becomes a relaxing, fun watch that is sure to draw people in.\n\n2. _Toradora!_ (Crunchyroll; Hulu)\n\nGENRE: Romantic Comedy\n\nWHY: _Toradora!_ is the best romance anime has to offer, and it does a lot more than just being funny and just jerking tears. Along with an introduction to some more anime tropes, _Toradora! _is a beautiful love story that also extends its exploration of the nature of love to familial ties and friendship. With unique, complex and vibrant characters, _Toradora!_ is a great choice for new anime watchers who like romance.\n\n[Toradora Cast]\n\n3. _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ (Hulu)\n\nGENRE: Shounen, Action, Adventure\n\nWHY: The classic shounen action anime, _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_, is probably the best anime with which to introduce action lovers to the genre. As with all great shows, _FMA:B _transcends its genre and is laden with symbolism, emotion and heart. Brilliant plotted, with extraordinary fights, _FMA: B_ also avoids fanservice and the more annoying anime tropes.\n\n[Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood]\n\n4. Other Recommendations\n\n-   _SILVER SPOON _(Crunchyroll, Hulu): From the same author as _Fullmetal Alchemist_, _Silver Spoon_ is an honest look at a high school boy’s struggle to grow up. It’s authentic, sometimes funny, sometimes heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking…but always, always true.\n-   _KYOUSOUGIGA _(Crunchyroll): A tour de force of the artistic [Silver Spoon Poster]capabilities of the anime in terms of storytelling, animation and use of the medium itself to create a unique experience that marks this show as uniquely anime.\n-   _TARI TARI _(Crunchyroll): Bright, friendly and totally inoffensive, _Tari Tari_ is another slice-of-life anime, an open-eyed look at the lives of graduating high school seniors, and the power of music and family.\n-   _KILL ME BABY_ (Hulu): Not for everyone, but the random slapstick humor of _Kill Me Baby_ is a great introduction to pure comedy anime. Because the comedy is character based, it’s easily relatable to a wide audience, although the occasional dumbness of it may leave some unimpressed.\n-   _THE ECCENTRIC FAMILY_ (Crunchyroll): A whimsical fantasy trip through the streets of Kyoto, _The Eccentric Family_ is yet another show that is uniquely Japanese and uniquely anime. With a focus on family themes and a lighthearted tone despite deep thematic material, this anime is one of great substance.\n-   _TONARI NO SEKI-KUN _(Crunchyroll): A hilarious short anime and a new entry to the list (the show hasn’t even finished airing at the time of this writing), _Tonari no Seki-kun _is an incredibly accessible comedy that serves both as quality humor and an easy introduction into a few tropes of the genre, including facial expressions.\n\n[Tonari no Seki-kun]\n\nThis second wave of shows introduces a few more anime tropes into the mix, and are generally well-received, easily accessible anime. The goal in this wave is acclimation: to tropes, to the method of storytelling, different art styles, genres and the general breadth of the medium.\n\n-   _SWORD ART ONLINE_ (Crunchyroll; Hulu): Despite the flack it has taken in the anime community, _Sword Art Online_ is still a easily accessible show, especially to those who have never seen anime before. It’s pretty looking, has relatable archetypal characters and a great soundtrack. And I personally think it’s better than it’s given credit for; so sue me.\n-   _ANGEL BEATS!_ (Crunchyroll; Hulu): An emotional show with amazing presentation, _Angel Beats! _ has the emotional resonance to capture a fledgling anime friend and further expose them to the emotional capabilities of the medium.\n-   _THE DEVIL IS A PART-TIMER! _(Hulu): An enjoyable and light-hearted comedy, _The Devil is a Part-Timer!_ is simply a fun ride through a comedic situation[Gurren Lagann] with lovable characters. Due to a few fanservice tropes that crop up and some occasionally crass scenes, it falls into the second wave, but still remains a worthwhile watch on the merits of characters and humor.\n-   _GURREN LAGANN_ (Crunchyroll; Hulu): About the closest you’ll get to anime canon on this list. Because _Gurren Lagann _is so over the top, it transcends the limitations of its genre. A great choice for actions fans, who will enjoy the bombast of gigantic robots chucking galaxies around like baseballs.\n-   _WORKING!!_ (Crunchyroll): A wonderful workplace comedy focused on character relationships, _Working!!_ or (_Wagnaria!!_) stands as a bright-eyed example of how good characters can elevate a show. The comedy is stellar and the characters are fun.\n-   _SOUL EATER_ (Hulu): Another great show for action fans, _Soul Eater _boasts a varied cast of entertaining characters, as well as great fights and even some thematic materials on the importance of the soul.\n-   _ATTACK ON TITAN_ (Crunchyroll; Hulu): So, you think anime is for kids? Much like _Sword Art Online_, _Attack on Titan_ is hugely popular because it appeals to wide demographic, making it a good gateway anime. A little heavy on blood and gore, but if you’re picking show while knowing genre preferences of your potential convert, you’ll know whether or not to use this anime.\n\n[Cowboy Bebop]\n\nI am certain there are some reading this saying, “Why was X anime left out? Are you crazy?” Here’s my answer. I can only recommend what I know. Thus, you won’t find _Dragonball Z_, _Sailor Moon_, _Cowboy Bebop_, _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, _Spice & Wolf_, or _Death Note_ on this list, because I haven’t seen yet them myself, and I refuse to recommend anything simply based on the hype behind it (justified though it may be). That is not to say that the aforementioned shows cannot be used as great introductions to a first time anime watcher. But, in the words of Hanekawa from the _Monogatari _series, “I don’t know everything. I only know what I know.” And in my case, I only know about the shows I’ve seen.\n",

I still remember the day that it all started, the day that I broke the last straw, lost the last emotion; the day I made the mistake of walking home after my graveyard shift.\n\t\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Trust me, lady,” the shady man from the alley said as he grabbed my arm—it wasn’t hard but it was far from gentle—whispering with heavy breaths, “I can see it in your eyes.”\t\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I need to go,” I shuddered in response; I was so scared, so unfamiliar.\n\t\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You's sad, I can see it, I know what you need, lady, trust me,” he went on, shoving a bag in my face, “*this* is the stuff you need.” I started to become frustrated, I mean, there was a smelly, shady young man whispering in my ear about some drug; little did I know, he would become my saviour.\n\t\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I don’t think *hallucinations*, are going to help me put my life back together,” I spat. Oh, the irony! I thought I had hit rock bottom back then, I didn’t know of the trenches lying ahead of me.\n\t\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“No, lady, heroin isn’t like that. You won’t hallucinate like MDMA or LSD; it’s a nice friendly drug.” he explained, “this shit doesn’t get you high, or screw you up, everything thing is just mellow, and happy—the world is beautiful.” That was the point where I was starting to become convinced, “you could smoke it at home, smoke it at work; heroin doesn’t create, it *erases.*” Sold, at the drop of a hat. That man—whom I now know as Trey, or in situations I’ve tried to repress, *babe*—knew how to use his words to manipulate me into doing whatever he pleased, a skill that proved useful to him later on. I revisited that alleyway 47 times after the fact, but I met Trey himself 164 times—our relationship evolved from simply the purchase and sale of heroin. At the time, it wasn’t manipulation, it was rescue: I was lonely, depressed, and barely managing to maintain a dead-end waitressing job; Trey showed me the drug that dissolved all my negativity, and his own presence dispersed my loneliness. What I now realize was the exploitation of resources seemed at the time to be real, maybe my rationality was altered by the heroin, but I felt the most sane I’ve ever been. Nine times out of ten, I would go somewhere with Trey and smoke the stash I’d bought *with* him, when I could only afford less but what I needed was more, he would even share some of his. I was so young and so stupid; I thought that’s what love was, *sharing your heroin.* God, I was so stupid.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It didn’t take long for me to fall in what I thought was love, but could you blame me? I was being provided with powdered happiness, the only thing I was really living for. I never realized that I had never spent a night with him sober; I made him priority, my moments with him were the only moments that mattered. To him, I was simply a customer, and then a sex toy—I was never a human being. Yet night after night I texted him over and over, smoked with him, made love to him—the cycle continued for months, and I loved it, but every thing must come to an end. A rude awakening, clichéd and yet the most unexpected thing to ever happen: I was pregnant; I missed my period the last month. At first, I brushed it off as a side effect of the alien substance running through my veins, but in a burst of rationality I got myself tested. I kept smoking—but I started to get careful, only smoking once a week, then once every two, however, I could never bring myself to really stop, why didn’t I stop? About 3 months in, I told Trey—well, I didn’t tell him, he noticed my hesitance and then my stomach, and with my lack of comprehensible response, he caught on.\n\t\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You’re goddamn pregnant,” he mumbled one day, obviously numbed by the drugs, “you can’t smoke my shit anymore.” I saw it as an act of care, a muted ‘I love you,’ but to him it was just a lost customer, lost money. In a stroke of epiphany my saviour and my enemy all at once developed another business idea. “If you smoke it, the baby gets all the drugs,” he spoke confidently, making me believe he had some medical knowledge—although, I would have believed anything from him at that point, “but if you inject it just stays in *your* blood.” Brilliant, absolutely brilliant; take my pregnancy and turn it into an investment, sell me more expensive drugs, take me even further down the rabbit hole. I never stopped doing heroin throughout my pregnancy. Trey left a few months later, as soon as he found out there wasn’t going to be an abortion, as soon as found out this was as much his responsibility as it was mine. He may have moved across the country or across the street, I didn’t know, but he blocked my calls and I gave up. I found another dealer, and I gave up. That’s how I know it wasn’t love on my part either, at least not love for the man, but for his produce. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was dedicated to that drug, so dedicated that I never thought more ahead than the next morning, I never thought about what I was doing to myself. I took 20 hits of heroin a day in my last trimester; I needed that much to handle the side effects of pregnancy. I half-expected the baby to die before I had to care for it—but it was stronger than I. April 26th—8 months and 23 days of pregnancy—I went into labour. The pain covered my entire body to such an extent that not even the heroin could make it stop; I felt almost helpless, I had no *human* friends to guide me. I knew only one thing coming into this—and its implications:\n\n1.  I have no money\n\t* I cannot afford to go to the hospital\n\t* I cannot afford to raise this baby\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Despite my long-term patronage to heroin, there remained sparse drops of sanity within me, and through those I determined that my only option was to keep the child. It was through those drops that I also realized the health of the baby would not be substantial, in fact, it is miraculous that the foetus remained to grow throughout the entire gestation period; the baby will be severely messed up if it survives birth. I had gotten myself into a situation that had no upside, but due to the influence I was under, I was so goddamn calm. I hadn’t a clue what I was to do, yet I hadn’t a crap to give—or perhaps a better way to explain was that I hadn’t the ability to feel, everything had a silver lining, even if it didn’t. \n\t\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I birthed the baby on my living room floor; I chose to do so because the carpeting was a deep maroon, therefore any stains would not be overly detrimental. He came out blue and silent, but he wasn’t dead—he was also not normal. He was ugly, it was so ugly. I knew for a fact such aesthetic could only stem from deformity, there was a muddled order of the features on its face, features that were not mine. This is not a child I felt the want or need to keep in my home, nor did I have the means of doing so. In what I thought was an excellent plan, I took the baby to the cool darkness outside of my home, and settled him gently on the floor. Using the materials around me I fashioned an intricate cradle of sticks and leaves—sturdier than concrete—and gently hung it upon the branch of a tree, low enough that I could just reach it. Gently, I placed the baby in its new cradle; I had the urge to kiss the baby goodbye, to feel any compassion, but the feeling was too easy to dismiss. In that moment, I had justified my own decision; if I didn’t love the baby, nobody would. I would visit it in the morning to feed and comfort it, I would keep the baby alive so not to be deemed a murderer; everything made so much sense.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I woke up the next morning, exceedingly sober. The implications of my actions slowly trickled into the back of my mind, like a drop of blood down my scalp. *I gave birth last night, while high, and I left the baby in a forest.* Glancing at the clock I noticed it had only been a few hours, I hoped to salvage the situation. That was the first morning in a very long time in which my primary thought had not been heroin. Running outside, it hit me that it was much too late; there was no possibility of a happy ending. By the trees I noticed what I though was a cradle and now realized is nothing but a pile of sticks and junk on the floor, stained slightly browner than its surroundings. The overwhelming smell of loss encompassed me as I lifted the ‘cradle’ away, revealing what was underneath. The foetus was covered in blood, skull cracked open, unmistakably dead. In my delusion, I did not witness myself hang a baby to a tree with some sticks, I did not realize how far my life had crashed downwards, how much I had ruined myself, I did not know that down would come baby, *‘cradle’ and all.*",

    "passage": "Isabel Losada\n\nISABEL LOSADA is a British Author of narrative non-fiction. Her most recent full-length books (_The Battersea Park Road to Paradise_, _Sensation_ and _The Joyful Environmentalist_) combine humour with a serious look at their subject matters and are true-life accounts of her own experiences.[1][2] She has one daughter and lives in Battersea, London.[3]\n\n\nBooks\n\nNew Habits\n\n_New Habits_ (Hodder) examines happiness among Church of England nuns. When a friend announced that she was going to become a nun (or more correctly a 'religious'), the author decided to interview ten more young women who were making the same choice to join a range of different Christian communities ranging from enclosed contemplative communities to Franciscan communities. The interviews cover the women's feelings about the vows of poverty, celibacy and obedience as well as describing other details of the daily life of a religious sister.\n\nThe book is included in the Diocesan Directors of Ordinands recommended reading list for those exploring vocation.[4]\n\nThe Battersea Park Road to Enlightenment\n\n_The Battersea Park Road to Enlightenment_ (Bloomsbury) is an exploration of the subject of happiness. In it she tries out many of the 'New Age' courses available in the UK that claim to offer routes to inner peace and personal fulfilment. The book explores Insight Seminars, T'ai chi, a retreat in an Anglican convent, Astrology, Tantric Sexuality,[5] Co-Dependent's Anonymous, Colonic irrigation, Rebirthing-breathwork, Past life regression with Roger Woolger various forms of massage including Stone massage and Kahuna Hawaiian massage, Neuro-linguistic Programming, an Anger management workshop, and a workshop on Angels with William Bloom. The book was chosen as Radio 4's Book of the week and Isabel performed it herself for the series. The book went on to become a bestseller in the UK and has been translated into 15 languages including Japanese and Russian. Oprah Radio host Mehmet Oz called the book “a fantastically cool endeavour”.[6] Bloomsbury produced a '10th Anniversary Edition' in 2011 and in 2014 the book is in its 20th reprinting.\n\nFor Tibet, with Love. A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World\n\n_For Tibet, with Love. A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World_ (Bloomsbury) explores what one person can do to make a difference, in this case to the cultural imperialism of the Chinese Government in Tibet. The book was republished in 2005 reversing the title and subtitle so became 'A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World' (which was also the title of the US edition).[7] This second UK edition also had a different ISBN. In 2010 Bloomsbury brought out a new third edition, with a new preface under the original title.[8] In this book Isabel travels to Lhasa explores how individuals and groups can use the media to raise awareness and influence public opinion and finally travels to Dharamsala to interview the 14th Dalai Lama.\n\nMen\n\n_Men_ (Virgin / Random House)[9] is a humorous examination of the widely experienced sociological phenomenon of there being many more single and available women over the age of 40 in our cities than men and answers the question “Where are all the interesting and available men?” The book considers the many factors that have produced this discrepancy including an interview with Simon Baron-Cohen, which details the differences between the male and the female brain. During a tour of Ireland to promote the book, she appeared on the renowned Gerry Ryan Show (the interview lasting a whole hour).[10] Following Ryan's untimely death, she declared that “making Radio with Gerry was better than having sex with most men”.[11]\n\nThe Battersea Park Road to Paradise\n\n_The Battersea Park Road to Paradise_, (Five Adventures in Being and Doing) (Watkins) explores Feng Shui, Anthony Robbins, Vipassana, Advaita and Shamanism was published in 2011. This book begins by exploring the impact of our environment and ends with an exploration of the nature of consciousness itself through the teacher Mooji and ends with an experience of taking Ayawaska with the Ashaninka in the Amazonian Rainforest.[12]\n\nSensation\n\n_Sensation_ (Watkins) is Losada's account of a year spent exploring the subject of sex between heterosexual couples, and in particular what makes sex into good sex in long term and loving relationships.[13] The research for the book involved participation in various courses, couple workshops, women-only weekends and attending the first international conference on Orgasmic Meditation. The book, part memoir and part manifesto in the cause for better relationships between men and women, has been praised for its honesty about a subject often shrouded in fear and shame despite the so-called sexual revolution.[14] Russell Brand, who interviewed Losada for an episode of his podcast Under The Skin with Russell Brand, stated that “I have learnt from Isabel that we are not approaching sex in a very conscious and connected way. It's very interesting to read a woman talking plainly and mechanically about sex. I want to learn this stuff.” [15] Sensation was also chosen as the ‘Non-Fiction Book of the Month’ by The Bookseller magazine.\n\nThe Joyful Environmentalist\n\n_The Joyful Environmentalist. How to Practice Without Preaching_ (Watkins) is Losada's collection of stories, reflections and ideas about the steps that an individual can take to help save the environment and the planet. As well as tips to reduce the use of plastic, switching to renewable energy, ethical banking, sustainable clothing choices, and gardening for biodiversity, Losada recounts her personal experiences of planting native trees in the Highlands of Scotland, playing Samba drums with Extinction Rebellion and visiting Knepp Castle estate and its pioneering rewilding project known as Knepp Wildland. The environmental and political activist George Monbiot is quoted as saying about the book, “this is the joy we need in our lives”.\n\n\nAwards\n\nIn 2019 Isabel was awarded ‘Author of the Year’ by Kindred Spirit magazine.[16] The magazine selected Isabel for the body of her work in the Mind Body Spirit sector and the award was secured by her popularity in a reader vote.\n\n\nTalks and Journalism\n\nIsabel gives comedy talks and presentations about her work, particularly at literary and arts festivals such as, for example, the Brighton Festival, The Edinburgh International Book Festival, Ways With Words (Dartington)[17] and the South Asian Literature Festival.[18] As part of the 2011 SW11 Literary Festival she was “Author in Residence”, which also involved spending nine days sat in the window of a Waterstone's bookshop![19][20] She has been interviewed about her work on BBC Radio 4's Midweek, Start the Week, Woman's Hour (several times) and Excess Baggage[21] as well as for Jeremy Vine and Steve Wright on BBC Radio 2. Isabel was also invited to present her own series (x12) of Thought for the Day for BBC Radio 2. She has been interviewed by local radio stations all over the UK, America and Australia on several book tours.\n\nShe writes regularly for newspapers and journals,[22][23][24] and the occasional blog.[25] A short article on the “importance of knowing nothing” was published by the prestigious Royal Society of Arts in 2011.[26]\n\n\nTibet\n\nShe has been a supporter of and active campaigner for the Tibetan cause for many years, and a founding member of 'Act for Tibet'. In 2003, during the writing of the book ''For Tibet, with Love '', she organised a stunt in Trafalgar square — a banner depicting the Dalai Lama was unfurled from the top of Nelson's Column and a pro-Tibet campaigner made a parachute jump.[27] Her list of 'top 10' books about the Dalai Lama and Tibet appeared in the Guardian.[28]\n\n\nThe Battersea Literature Festival\n\nIn 2014 Isabel was invited to become the artistic director of The Battersea Literature Festival. A Festival that takes place in the first two weeks of September in various locations in Battersea which include The Battersea Arts Centre, The Battersea Power Station and local bookshops. Isabel described being given this opportunity as 'The dream job for an author between books.'\n\n\nPatronage\n\nIsabel is the Patron of the Charity 'Centrepieces'.[29]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n-   _New Habits: Today's Women Who Choose to Become Nuns_ (1999)\n-   _Battersea Park Road to Enlightenment_ (2001)\n-   _For Tibet, with Love.

    "passage": "Jason Dasey\n\nJASON DASEY is a TV and radio broadcaster, journalist, professional emcee and media executive. He was the first Australian sports host on CNN International and BBC World News and the original anchor of ESPN's SportsCenter Asia and SportsCenter India (English edition). Best known to Asian audiences, Jason is a former vice-president and lead anchor for the Malaysian network ASTRO. Returning to Australia in 2019, he is a journalist at ABC News (Australia) and a radio correspondent for Singapore station Money FM 89.3.\n\n\nEarly career\n\nThe eldest of four brothers, Jason grew up in Sydney where he attended North Sydney Boys High School and was co-editor of the school's magazine. His father was an advertising copywriter and artist, while his mother was a cooking book author and cooking teacher. Jason's first newspaper articles were published in the North Shore Times in 1977. From 1978, he became a freelance sports reporter for Australian Associated Press. At the start of 1980, Jason joined The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's oldest newspaper, as a cadet journalist. In December 1980 at the age of 18, he broke his first major story, securing an exclusive interview with a Soviet defector who jumped ship in Sydney Harbour to seek political asylum.\n\nTowards the end of his four years with the Herald, Jason's personal vacation to New York City in September 1983 coincided with Australia winning sailing's America's Cup. Jason borrowed a blazer and talked his way into the New York Yacht Club before sending back an insider's account to the Sydney Morning Herald on the night the United States lost the America's Cup for the first time after 132 years.\n\n\nMove to Television\n\nThat front-page story from a famous edition of the Herald helped 21-year-old Jason land a job at Australia's Seven Network in Sydney where he worked between 1983 and 1985 as an on-air reporter for Seven News and its nightly 'Willesee' current affairs show. At the end of 1985 after a six-month stint as a researcher for BBC Nine O'Clock News in London, he became a producer and reporter for SBS-TV in Sydney.\n\nIn 1987, Jason returned to London where he would base himself for most of the next decade, with his paternal grandmother from Staffordshire. Initially, he freelanced as a producer/reporter for SBS-TV, Fairfax Media, Reuters TV and BBC TV for whom he was an assistant producer on Breakfast Time, contributing to its coverage of Australia's Bicentenary, including producing a back-stage interview with Barry Humphries in London's West End. In January 1989, Jason became a sports producer and reporter for European satellite network Sky News as it launched in Britain. A year later at Sky, he gained his first regular experience in the studio, as a weekend sports presenter.\n\n\nBBC and CNN Jobs\n\nJason's biggest break came at the end of 1994. As a freelance producer and occasional presenter for BBC World Service Television in London, he was promoted to senior sports anchor on the re-branded BBC World News after a fill-in stint as host. It made him the first Australian newsreader on the global network as part of ‘Newsday’, a breakfast show for Europe, with co-hosts Philip Hayton, Melinda Wittstock and Richard Quest.\n\nAfter three years in London with the BBC, Jason moved to the U.S. in 1997. After serving as a freelance reporter for BBC World Service and Denver local station, KUSA-TV 9-News (NBC), Jason re-located to Atlanta in early 1999 to take up a job at CNN International. He was initially a news producer/writer, but in May 1999, Jason became the first Australian sports anchor on CNN International's World Sport, broadcasting daily to more than 200 countries, often in partnership with Pedro Pinto.

Gabe agrees to go anyway, for a chance at stopping terrorist leader Ghassan al-Bitar, a Syrian he almost caught a year ago, and with whom he has a score to settle.\n\nWith his partner Lian Xing on vacation in Cyprus, Gabe flies to the Indian Ocean where a clan of Somali pirates called the Warsingala Protectors have invaded the ship. Bitar is leading them, and Gabe suspects this assault involves more than a mere pirating operation. Intercepting Spec Ops communications, pilot Alima Haddad warns Gabe that Cordell did not tell him everything, and Logan realises the contents of Hold Five, a secret even to the Navy, are Bitar's primary target.\n\nEstablishing a link to _St. Helens_{{'}} communications dish, Alima attempts to extract Logan, but her helicopter is shot down. Despite Gabe's efforts, she dies. Frustrated and furious, Gabe destroys several pirate boats carrying stolen goods from _St Helens_ and re-enters the ship via the damaged main hull. However, Bitar has already stolen the cargo inside Hold Five, which NIOC couriers ship.\n\nWhen Gabe reaches the bridge, s with the Fifth Fleet have already begun launching cruise missiles to scuttle their own ship. He tries to stop Bitar from escaping, but terrorist Fahid Tamer distracts him. Gabe kills Fahid and escapes from the ship before it sinks. His return to the Agency brings more complications when Cordell mentions Lian was “never” in Cyprus, and produces pictures of her with a Chinese man, both in a foreign land. From Cordell's point of view, Lian being a defector or a double agent, the Agency would be compromised, and the NIOC suspends the IPCA.\n\nDespite Teresa's reservations, and running out of options, Gabe enlists a marine salvage expert Dane Bishop to explore the sunken _St Helens_ for NIOC courier files that could have the information of where Lian was when she was photographed. The duo find Spetsnaz divers are also searching for evidence. Gabe realises they work for Surgei Kudrenko, another antagonist who survived an attempt that Gabe made on his life on a mission years earlier. Bishop cuts a hole inside the ship, sucking Logan into the hull, and Gabe follows his advise on destroying the engine turbines. When they rendezvous, the pair stop the ship's nuclear reactor from melting down and kill Kudrenko's right-hand man, Surgeyev, before the enemy can escape with the courier codes.\n\nThe decoded microfiles show pictures captured by MI6 in Azerbaijan. Lian and the Chinese male are hostages, but the Spetsnaz are also looking for them, suggesting they found out about the St Helens through their intelligence resources. Compounding the situation is the Russians who are conducting genocidal killings and ethnic cleansing activities throughout the country. Believing that Lian might get killed, Gabe teams up with Maggie Powers, who claims to be in the same region to “track smugglers”, to find out who captured Lian. While searching a hotel room shared by Lian and her accomplice, Gabe encounters a Chinese Secret Service agent, codenamed Trinidad. The two fight and kill Spetsnaz forces, but Trinidad abandons Logan to find Maggie on his own. Although he rescues her from interrogators, Kudrenko captures them after they destroy a Russian gunship.\n\nInside a gulag, Trinidad confronts Gabe, the Chinese admitting that she was Lian's instructor in the CSS; but Xing defected when Gabe recruited her into the Agency, tarnishing Trinidad's reputation. According to Trinidad, her student used to be married to the man seen in the pictures, Shen Rei. China wants him back because he is the inventor of the device stolen from the St Helens, and Trinidad helps free Gabe from custody so he can find them. Logan wonders about the significance of the device, such that America, Russia, China and Syria all want it. He begins to suspect Maggie is attempting to acquire it as well for England, and does not know whom to trust.\n\nGabe kills Kudrenko during an aeroplane firefight, but Cordell arrests Maggie and tells Logan he has shut down the agency; because the NIOC believes that Shen and Lian work for Bitar. Cordell had used Gabe from the very start to locate them. The NIOC now knows where al-Jamil's desert stronghold is, but Logan is forced to accept early retirement. Against his belief that Cordell is right, Teresa informs Gabe that Lian is in love with him, and must be Bitar's prisoner if none of the world powers have Shen. Gabe realises that Cordell will bomb al-Jamil's base, and it will kill Lian.\n\nHe assists several Army Rangers in the assault on al-Jamil, but Gabe must enter the bunker on his own in search of Bitar. He finds Lian alive, and the two study Shen's device, the X-Z-2. It then transpires that the device is Shen's solution to the energy crisis, but China wanted to weaponise it, so he defected with Lian's help and fled to Pakistan. Gabe finds information proving that Cordell hired Bitar as a means to bring Shen to NIOC couriers. Cordell was desperate to retrieve the X-Z-2 before competing nations could, but Bitar had other plans. The latter decided to steal the device and use Shen to make bombs that would destroy oil sources, thus driving Western influence from the Middle East.\n\nEverything Cordell did since then was a cover-up, and Gabe has him taken away by soldiers to ensure “his” own early retirement. Lian has difficulty talking to Gabe about Shen, and Gabe focuses on stopping al-Jamil at a Syrian dam which Bitar will use to charge the last of the X-Z-2 devices for future attacks on the West. During the mission, Lian becomes distracted with saving Shen, and abandons her post to find him, rendering herself incommunicado in the process. Gabe reaches Shen first, and the two disable most of the X-Z-2 bombs before going after Bitar. The terrorist tries to escape with the final bomb, but Shen has rigged it as a dud. Gabe shoots the sabotaged device, destroying it and killing his adversary.\n\nHe finds Lian and Shen outside the dam, but Trinidad also appears. She has shadowed Gabe the entire time, even when he was in Virginia. Trinidad's opinion being that Logan must be kept alive just so he can lead her to Shen, she provides covering fire for Gabe and murdered al-Jamil operatives on several occasions, but she still believes him expendable in the long run. Shen is unwilling to let his device become a weapon, so he commits suicide.\n\nIn a post-credits cutscene, Gabe and Lian return to the gym in Langley where Teresa had set up the remote command center during the Agency's shutdown. Gabe has decided he will retire, believing there are too many secrets in his work. Instead, he will look for Addison and Blake Hargrove while trying to begin a new life. They enter to find Mujari lying on the floor dead, and Teresa injured. She warns them to be careful, and Trinidad ambushes them. Gabe pushes Lian aside and kills Trinidad, but is shot four times himself. He lies on the floor as Lian shouts and tries to revive him.\n\n\nMultiplayer\n\nPlayers can play as new factions in five game modes, two of which are new to the franchise. The new modes are Sabotage and Retrieval. Sabotage pits two teams against each other as they try to locate bomb codes and arm the other team's nuclear warhead and guard it to prevent them from disarming their bomb until the timer runs out, while Retrieval has players trying to retrieve a beacon from the enemy's base and return it to their own base to score a point. Returning modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Rogue Agent.\n\n_Combat Ops_ demo\n\n[_Syphon Filter: Combat Ops_.]\n\n_Syphon Filter: Combat Ops_ is a multiplayer game released on the PlayStation Network on November 20, 2007.[3] _Logan's Shadow_ features a playable sneak preview from the main menu.

Using: fine ground blender bud or lightly broken up small pieces of bud in the same size extraction tube?\n2. will the produced oil differ in color, smell, or texture made from fine ground vs lightly broken up small pieces of bud?\n3. will running blender fine ground buds allow me to process more bud in a quicker amount of time than using the lightly broken up small pieces of bud?\n\nTHE FIRST RUN OF FINE GROUND BLENDER BUDS\nRAN 2 EXTRACTION TUBES OF 300 GRAMS: 9 CANS OF BUTANE PER EXTRACTION TUBE\nTOTAL OF 600 GRAMS\n\n[]\n\nFROZEN BUTANE AND FROZEN TUBES:\n\n[]\n\nDID THIS TWICE:\n\n[]\n\nAFTER AIR PURGING OVERNIGHT:\n\n[]\n\nSCRAPED ONTO PARCHMENT:\n\n[]\n\nIN THE CHAMBER FOR DE-MUFFINING:\n\n[]\n\nFOLDED UP MUFFIN AND WEIGHED 151.9 GR - 7.7 GR PARCHMENT =144.2 GR POST MUFFIN:\n\n[]\n\nAFTER VAC PURGING FOR HOURS IT SETTLED DOWN AND LOST 12.6 GR WEIGHT:\n\n[]\n\nSEVERAL HOURS LATER IT WAXED UP NICELY AND LOST A BIT MORE WEIGHT 131.6 PLUS 3 GRAMS SCRAPS ON PAPER=134.6 GRAM TOTAL\n\n[]\n\nNICE GOLDEN SAND COLOR:\n\n[]\n\nSUPER DANK HONEYCOMB!\n\n[]\n\n^^^ THIS FIRST RUN YIELDED 22.44% ^^^\n\nTHE SECOND RUN: THE LIGHTLY BROKEN UP BUDS\nRAN ONE TUBE OF 185 GRAMS WITH 7 TUBES OF BUTANE\n\n[]\n\nLIGHTLY BROKEN UP INTO VERY SMALL PIECES OF BUD-NO BLENDER OR CUTTING\n\n[]\n\nPACKED TUBE WITH SAME PROCEDURE AND PRESSURE AS FIRST RUN:\n\n[]\n\nREADY TO BLAST:\n\n[]\n\nUSED 7 TUBES OF BUTANE:\n\n[]\n\nAFTER DE-MUFFINING WEIGHED 46.9 GR- 6.1 GR PARCHMENT = 40.8 GRAMS\n\n[]\n\nAFTER VAC PURGING FOR AWHILE:\n\n[]\n\nAFTER SEVERAL HOURS MORE IT WAXED UP NICELY TO A NICE BLONDE SANDY COLOR:\n\n[]\n\nNICE HONEYCOMBING LIKE THE FIRST RUN:\n\n[]\n\nFINAL WEIGHT WAS 35.3 PLUS 1.3 GR SCRAPS ON PAPER = 36.9 GR\n\n[]\n\n^^^ THIS SECOND RUN YIELDED 20% ^^^\n\nMY CONCLUSIONS:\n\n1. FINELY GROUND BUDS IN A BLENDER = HIGHER YIELD THAN LIGHTLY BROKEN UP SMALL PIECES OF BUDS BY HAND WITH NO CUTTING OR GRINDING\n\n2. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN COLOR, SMELL, OR TEXTURE OF THE HONEYCOMB WITH EITHER BATCHES.\n\n3. I CAN LOAD WAY MORE FINELY GROUND BLENDER BUDS IN MY EXTRACTION TUBES THAN LIGHTLY BROKEN UP BUDS WHICH WILL ENABLE ME TO RUN MUCH MORE PRODUCT IN WAY LESS TIME. I CAN FIT 300 GRAMS OF FINE GROUND BUD IN MY TUBES AND ONLY 185 GRAMS OF LIGHTLY HAND BROKEN UP BUDS IN THE SAME TUBES. AND THAT'S USING THE SAME PACKING PROCEDURE AND PRESSURE IN THE TUBES. THAT IS 62% MORE MATERIAL I CAN PROCESS IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME RESULTING IN THE SAME QUALITY OF PRODUCT.\n\nFINAL CONCLUSION: I WILL ALWAYS RUN FINELY GROUND BLENDER BUDS IN FROZEN TUBES WITH FROZEN BUTANE.\n\n​\n\n-   \n-   #2\n\nWTF!?

I was using the coffee grinder but it was too small and now I wanna try a food processor because with the blender I am poking the buds around to get them to all get down to the bottom of the blender to get ground out. I think the food processor might be even better for this.\n\nI think my last batch of trim run turned out darker because I ground it right off the racks. Don't think I froze it then ground it up.\nI'll make sure everything is good and frozen before I do the trim run. I think it makes a big difference in not letting the plant material leak out any moisture and chlorophyll etc.\n\n  That's some blonde hash for being ground up! I'm trying to remember if I was freezing my material when I tried ground up bud. I don't think I was at the time.\n\n  How long do you leave the blender on for? I might have to try this later today.\n\n  Good job on your product!\n\nYa man I think it HAS to be frozen pre-grinding. Think it makes a big difference. The blender grinds it really quick. Only a few seconds with some poking of the buds to get them down into the chopping blades. Like I mentioned above though; I think a food processor might do an even better quicker job of it. Gonna try and sneak the wife's processor out to give it a try [:lol:]\n\n  Looks good, + rep. (if I could give it again)\n\n  I do agree the second batch is more aesthetically pleasing.

    "passage": "Genitals Are Surprisingly Resilient\n\nThe most popular children in school were the handsome ones.\n\nEveryone liked the handsome ones. The handsome ones were usually funny, sporty, overflowing with confidence, well dressed and just generally awesome. They were going to grow up to be the kinds of people that drive sports cars and spend their time on yachts in the Mediterranean, keeping company with other ridiculously good looking people.\n \n'Good Looking Lee Parkinson' was actually so handsome that girls would ovulate every time he smiled at them. Boys would be left confused about their sexuality if they so much as stood in the same room as him. Even teachers regarded him with dreamy, vacant expressions. He left a trail of dazed people in his wake - all wanting to run their fingers through his gorgeous, soft, blonde hair or just lick his exquisitely sculpted face – or maybe that was just me.\n \nI don’t know what 'Good Looking Lee Parkinson' went on to do as an adult, he’s probably a male model, but I like to think he’s working as a rent boy to fund his heroin and crack habits, after losing his job as a toilet attendant for spying on old men on the loo.\n \nThere was also Natasha and Luke DiMarco – brother and sister, who both modelled children’s clothes for catalogues. They were from the new housing estate where the houses were actually made of brick. I have no idea how they ended up at my school. \n\nWhat was extra special about Natasha and Luke was the fact that they were friendly and down to earth. Whereas 'Good Looking Lee Parkinson' would barely acknowledge me, just in case I contaminated him with a terminal social disease, Natasha and Luke would occasionally talk to me. This left me thinking there was a chance that Natasha could become my girlfriend, and for a long time I fixated upon her. I never mustered the courage to do more than say the occasional hello, and would turn weak with delight whenever she said hello back. I also wrote her endless letters that I was too embarrassed to give her. In short, it was the kind of unhinged, unrealistic desire that if you don’t grow out of, ends with a restraining order.\n \nIf there was Natasha, Luke, 'Good Looking Lee Parkinson' and Stephen Bridges at one end of the popularity scale, there was Martin Macintyre, Jim Clinton, Gary Winkett and Suzanne Parker at the other.\n \nMartin Macintyre was basically some kind of animal stuck in the body of a human – prone to attack for no reason – barely articulate until it came to telling you what he was going to do to you after school. He loved to expose himself, running around the playground holding his penis by the foreskin and pulling it until it was twice the normal length.\n \nHe even urinated on me a couple of times in the toilets, and one of his favourite past-times was to wait until you were sat on the loo, then climb up on to the sink, stick his head over the top of the cubicle and spit on you until you had finished. Then of course he would give you a good thump in the face when you opened the door.\n \nI remember sitting on that toilet many times, weighing up whether it was better to continue getting spat on, or go out and get smacked in the face. It's funny, but you've no idea how attractive being drenched in saliva becomes when you’re faced with a painful enough alternative.\n \nWhen Martin wanted some real fun, he would sit at his desk and shit himself - unable to contain his enormous grin, waiting for people to notice the smell. Sometimes he would just lose his mind and run around the classroom punching pupils and teacher.\n \nNowadays he would be drugged senseless with Ritalin and placed on the sex offender’s register, but back then nothing ever seemed to happen to him - the teachers were too scared of him. He was just left to traumatise us.\n \nAt break times, I would often stand in the playground with my fellow social rejects; one of us perched on a bench for maximum visibility, like a Meerkat, hoping to spot one of the many playground threats before they got too close.\n \nLike most bullies, Martin stayed away from people who fought back, and relied on people like me to provide his amusement.\n \nI had been brought up not to retaliate.\n \nMum: 'Don't stoop to their level, Barry.'\n \nTranslation: 'Just stand there and let the deranged child beat seven colours of shit out of you.'\n \nMum: 'Use words to settle conflict.'\n \nTranslation: 'Whilst you're receiving repeated head butts in the face from the deranged child, stay positive, try to find common ground, and use calming language. Don’t forget to keep smiling in an unthreatening manner.'\n \nMum: 'It takes strength to walk away from a fight.'\n \nTranslation: 'Turn away from the deranged child, and once he climbs on your back and starts biting your hair off, stay strong and continue walking away. Eventually he'll grow bored of it and get off you.'\n \n‘Martin’s coming this way!!’ the alarm sounded.\n \nThe resulting stampede was like a scene from the Serengeti as Wildebeest lose their minds trying to get away from a lion - scattering in all directions - happy to trample their own offspring if it means not getting eaten.\n \n‘Quick, b-b-behind the Art Block,’ screamed Ian Mailer in a high pitched voice.\n \nThe Art Block was a stand-alone wooden building on the edge of the playground where we would go for art lessons. I don’t think many schools have custom built classrooms for art, but this was to protect the normal classrooms because most art lessons ended with desks, walls, children and teacher all painted in bold colours, with a variety of objects glued to them.\n \nYou’ve probably had situations in your life where you’ve had to run from something, but fear prevents your legs from working properly. At times like that, my brainpower seemed to get diverted away from the bit that controls my limbs to help support the bit that does my screaming.\n \nAs Martin charged, my legs flopped around uselessly.\n \nI was the low-hanging fruit.\n \nThe runt, who in the wild, would be quickly and mercifully dispatched from the gene pool.\n \nUnfortunately, there was no such escape in the playground – no quick death, and no daddy Wildebeest to come to your rescue and miraculously fight the lion off.\n \nEven the dinner ladies would conveniently spot other things to attend to when Martin chose to tear his way through the easy prey.\n \nIn any sane world, Ian Mailer would be the one to be caught as he waddled away on his little potato-shaped legs, with the rest of us safely out of sight by the time he’s brought crashing to the ground, uselessly screaming for help.\n \nBut it was usually me left behind, captured, and subjected to ten minutes of cartoon violence.\n \nEveryone on the playground watched in fascination as I stumbled along like Bambi, eyes wide with fear, looking around in the futile hope that someone would help me.\n \nOnce sure I had been captured, my fellow meerkats crept from behind the Art Block, knowing they were now safe and could kick back and enjoy the spectacle.\n \nMartin started proceedings by dragging me around by my hair, occasionally winding me with a few rapid punches to the stomach. I suffered in silence, resigned to the fact that the only thing that would end this was when he, and he alone, felt as if he’d had his fill of ultra-violence.\n \nAfter the dragging and winding, came the wedgie - not just a tug on my Y-fronts, but an attempt to stretch them up my back and over my head - to double them up as underwear and a hat at the same time.\n \nStill, I didn't shout out, only vomited a little, showing admirable self-control in the face of mind-numbing pain. The saving grace was that my testicles had somehow avoided a good squeezing, and my bum crack had taken most of the strain.\n \nWedgie finished, he paused for a moment, his face clouded with thought. This wasn't going too well. Why wasn't Barry screaming for his Mum like he normally did?\n \nMy stoic demeanour, a feeble attempt to show him that he had no power over me, only served to enrage him further.\n \nNow, I knew that if I was ever captured whilst on her Majesty's service, I could put up with a reasonable amount of torture before coughing up the detonation codes to the nuclear bomb that would destroy England. I had suffered enough pain in my life - so a bit more wouldn’t faze me.\n \n‘You want to wire me up to the mains and shock my nipples until they start smoking? No problem – my Mum used my step-dad's football boot to literally beat me to death when I was five. So go ahead - do your worst.’\n \nBut I knew that once they went to work on my testicles, I would sing like a canary on speed.\n \nEvery boy knew their true Achilles-heel was hanging in a shrivelled sack between their legs.\n \nMartin Macintyre, no doubt having had his own testicles banged a few times, knew this.\n \nProblem: Barry Stephenson isn't screaming for his Mum to come and save him. This isn't as much fun as usual.\n \nSolution: Hold him down on the ground and punch his testicles.\n \nAnd sure enough, as the blows rained down on my balls I couldn't get the screams out fast enough. If you can picture a cat, a monkey and a goose being simultaneously kicked around a room by a very angry Chuck Norris, then you come somewhere near the noise that echoed around the school that day.\n\nIf you can imagine Chuck Norris kicking animals around his lounge, then well done - sort of. If you can't, start off with just the goose and pay particular attention to Chuck's face, screwed up with rage. That goose has clearly done something very bad to annoy Chuck that much. Once that's working for you - imagine someone throwing the monkey in from stage left. Now Chuck really ramps things up to eleven on the dial. Be in awe of his ferocity for just a couple of minutes or so before the wide-eyed cat finally gets added to the fray. Now Chuck is just an inhuman blur of righteous wrath.\n\nNow you may have asked yourself, 'Why would Chuck Norris resort to kicking these poor creatures around his house? Surely there are other ways to deal with ill-disciplined animals?' Well I'm afraid I can't really give a satisfactory answer. What Chuck Norris gets up to in his own home, and why, is his business and we should probably just respect his need for privacy. Certainly, we shouldn't rush to judge him until we know the full story.\n \nMy beating seemed to go on for an age. I was obviously making just the right kind of noises to hold Martin's interest. I think his primitive brain went through life constantly making the following calculation, 'Is the reward from this action equal to, or greater, than the amount of effort I'm putting into it?'\nIn this particular case, the answer was clearly a resounding yes and his brain got stuck in a positive feedback loop, causing him to keep hammering away.\n \nThe rest of the school, as they looked on, gradually stopped laughing and I heard someone shout,\n \n'Martin, I think he's had enough now. Come on.'\n\nThat's right. Your astonishing powers of deduction have brought you to the conclusion that I've only just had enough. Just now. It was fine before that, but once we got past the fifteenth thump in the trousers and the swelling was becoming noticeable to everyone, getting my testicles pummelled just didn't hold the same attraction for me any more.\n \nI don't know if the pain became too much for the human brain to endure, or whether I just screamed myself unconscious, but I eventually blacked-out.\n \nLife is full of pleasant little surprises. Small mercies. It's things like that – passing out into a blissful state of unawareness as someone declares war on your nut-sack that makes life so bearable.\n \nSurprisingly, Martin was excluded from school for a whole two days. Two days he would have spent attacking pensioners, and breaking into the houses of people unfortunate enough to be gainfully employed.\n \nMy mum was called to come and take me home. The next day, being unable to walk, I was carted off to my G.P.\n \n'Well Mrs. Stephenson, the swelling may take a week or two to completely disappear, and the black scrotum will eventually return to its normal healthy pink - but genitals are surprisingly resilient so I don't think we need to worry too much,' said the Doctor after prodding me between the legs for a while, unperturbed by my yelps of pain.\n \n'Over the next week make sure he wears very loose underwear and trousers.’\n\nTwo day’s later; I was back at school, hobbling around the playground in my bright red knitted trousers, my legs spread wide as if I was riding a horse, making sure there was plenty of room for my scrotum which, by now, looked like a little black cauliflower.\n \nThe expected ridicule didn’t come though. I actually received some sympathetic glances. Most of the children who had witnessed the savageness of the beating were probably suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. This would, for most of them, have been the closest they would ever come to witnessing an actual real-life murder.\n\n\nThanks for reading. This is actually a chapter from my soon to be published novel based upon my childhood, called 'Recollections of a Half-Wit'.\n",

    "passage": "Ice fishing [part one]\n\nIn the safety of my apartment\n\nIt was cold that night. I rode home on my bike. Mist was surrounding me like cobwebs in a spiders den. I buried my chin deep in my collar to protect my neck from the cold. My fingers frozen, red and wrapped tightly around the handlebar. One more block, two more turns and I was home. but coming home would only start the shit that I got into. I can’t sleep and continuously relive that night. How I relive that night is how I write it down.\n\n\nMy apartment is in a district just short of being a ghetto. The walkways are partially lit by still unbroken fluorescent lights. Through the mist I  that the light of the apartment below is still flickering. Nobody lives there and our rich tenant has dozens of other apartment buildings he rather maintains. He gets our rent anyway, and that is all he cares about. This flat will deteriorate until the cracks in the concrete grow enough to bring her down. Nonetheless I am actually happy with my apartment. It is my first house and my room itself is neat and cozy.\n\n\nIn the entrance I can hear a lone junk coughing. I try to pass him unnoticed, but the echo of my footsteps through the hall give me away. From under a dirty brown hood, the pale face stares at me. It mumbles something, but I can't make anything of it. Evading his stare, I quickly ascend the stairs. The encounter made me more nervous than it should. Arm hair is raised under my coat. It feels like the echoing taps of my footsteps draw the attention from nightly visitors. On the third floor I stop and look left to the walkway. Someone stands there. Ten metres away, in front of the of the apartment below mine, number 34. His silhouette appearing and disappearing with the flickering fluorescent light. I freeze as he sees me. A flickering later he stands in the open doorway. Another flickering. The door slams shut and the silhouette is gone. An eerie chill climbs up my spine. I glance away from the apartment where I would normally see cars and people passing, just to comfort myself with reality, but this time there are no cars, no people, just faint streetlights glowing in the thick mist.\n\n\nI feel cold and vulnerable on the open walkway. The freezing air creeps up my neck as I grab the keys from my pocket. My frozen fingers lose grip before sliding the key in the hole. With a ringing sound the keys drop to the ground. As I bow down to get the keys, I feel eyes watching me closely. I feel them stalking me, but I don’t look. I have seen enough creepy shit tonight.\n\n\nA warm stream of air greets me when I open my door. This is my safe haven. My neat home protecting me from the rest of the cold, eerie flat. At the end of my dark hallway, from a small table, shining eyes of a cat greet me. Stuart is the best roommate I could wish for. He guards the house, keeps me company, and all he wishes in return is catfood and an occasional stroke. Stuart buries his head between his paws to hide from the lights as I turn them on. As usual I take a glass of whiskey and get ready for bed. 11 pm. While brushing my teeth I think about what happened. Staring in the sink, I think about the man with the pale face, about the silhouette that entered the apartment below me. There were often junks and tramps in this building, but this feels different. The chill in my spine is back. A sudden fear of looking up in the mirror creeps into me. I keep brushing, all the while looking in the sink. What if I look in the mirror and don’t see my own face? What if I do not see what I expect? I don’t know where this fear comes from, but it doesn’t seem to make sense. Come back to senses, you pussy. I look up. I realise I was right. I was right being scared. A pale face gazes into my eyes. The face is filled with the same horror as mine, but it isn’t my face. God fucking dammit. With shaking hands I push myself away from the sink and stumble back. I rip the shower curtain down with me as I fall into the sink. My head slams hard against the back of the bathtub. Dazed, I get up and force myself to look again. The mirror now shows my own, pained face. I should sleep. It has been a long day and I am exhausted.\n\n\nStuart sits in the bathroom doorway, meowing for food. I just fed him when I came home, how can this thing be hungry now? While I fetch him some food, he strokes my legs with his flanks. Before heading to bed, I check the time on my phone. My phone! It is not in my pocket. My wallet and keys, gone too. As if the night couldn’t get any worse. One more time, I pull myself together. I will just go to bed. I probably put my stuff on the table or something and forgot. Tomorrow I will check, now I must sleep.\n\n\nI wouldn’t get any sleep that night.\n\n\nI’m lying in bed, staring into the blackness above me. My eyelids don’t want to shut. As if my eyes told them something bad will happen if they do. As pitchdark as my room is, fooling myself that my eyes are closed doesn’t work. At least, not enough to sleep. I have to sleep. I need to. With force, I squeeze them shut, losing my awareness of the room.\n\nBang. A sound hits me. My eyelids spring back open. Staring at the ceiling, I hear a shoving sound repeating near my bed. I can’t help but to breathe heavily when my heart pumps this heavy. Looking right, I see my nightstand standing to the wall more than a metre away from the bed. It is not supposed to stand there. What the fuck? My own fucking nightstand is screwing with me now? While right next to me? I like to believe I am rational. I want to explain this. I can not explain this. Well, Apart from that I’m going crazy, I can not explain this.\n\n\nI’m done. I’m getting Stuart. My heart is still pounding when I open the door. A shock stops it for a moment. In the faint moonlight, the cat sits in front of my bedroom door on an eighteenth century dining chair. The dining table is over to the side of the balcony. This chair had moved all the way across the room. Something is screwing with me. Stuart looks at me. A questioning face. I feel like he wants to tell me what happened, but he can’t. I paranoidly glance across the moonlit livingroom, dragging the chair behind me. Stuart jumps off and follows me, seeking comfort at my feet.\n\n\nThe chairs around the dining table are neither how I left them. They all stand just too awry. The room is silent. Probably just like it is where you are, while reading this. But my silence is an unsettling silence. Like something is there, holding it’s breath, observing me. My own apartment doesn't feel safe anymore. As if a burglar is in the house, I feel a presence. A burglar… As I’m thinking, I fear that this presence is worse than any kind of burglar. I am alone and being haunted. \n\n\nI would call a friend of mine now, if I just had my phone. I should look for it. I turn on the lights. Somewhere, a door closes. The click sends a shiver down my spine. Stuart looks at me with his eyes wide open. I need my phone. It isn’t on the dining table. Not on the coffee table either. Frustration and desperation are growing inside me. I throw open cupboards and drawers, clashing the cutlery inside them. I don’t want this to be true. I want to wake up in the morning sun, far away from this nightmare. Some more alcohol in my blood might give make me sleepy enough to get there. Giving up the search, I take  whiskey from one of the opened cupboards. The whiskey pouring into the glass now is the sole thing breaking the silence. Somehow it comforts me a little. Half a glass should do it.\n\n\n\nI shamble back to my bedroom, switch the lights back off and suddenly it hits me. I fell in the bathtub. How stupid could I be? My stuff probably fell out of my pocket and is still in the tub. With the glass in my hand and Stuart at my feet, I stand in front of the bathroom door. It is closed. “Did you do that, Stuart?” He looks at me, than at the door. His back arches. His fur rises. “What the fuck? Stop that” I whisper it to him, but he doesn’t listen. As if stepped on, he spurts back into the living room and hides on a seat under the dining table. Stuart always behaved so carefree, opening one eye when the neighbor’s barking dog ran into my apartment. Yet now he is nothing more than a little, black ball of rolled up fear. The bathroom light, glowing at the edging of the door, stands out against its dark surroundings. I should turn it off and get my stuff. For a moment I look back at the shining white dots staring at me from under the table.\n\n\nFear grabs a hold of me. I don't want to know what hides behind the door. I chug the glass of whiskey and grab Stuart from under his hiding place. Shared sorrow is half a sorrow? I guess that works with fear as well. Back in my bedroom I notice the nightstand being back at its original spot. I’m sure some people would have lost it by now, but I won’t. I shut the door. I tell myself everything will be better in the morning. I hide under the duvet, with Stuart at my feet. I wait until the drowsiness kicks in. The alcohol is fighting the adrenalin inside me. For a moment the alcohol gains the upper hand and I close my eyes.\n ",

Are the characters compelling? Are there scenes that I should decompact?\n\nI haven't written much prose, and all the help would be appreciated and reciprocated. \n\n\nA Lost Week\nby Andrew Milewski\n\nAvery pulled his comforter tight. The comforter, wrapping around his shoulder, hugged his ears with warmth. His naked ankles shook. His toe joints hardened. In his primordial consciousness, Avery bent his knees and pulled into himself. He thought, though not in words. His hands meandered over his knees, up his fat, hairy thighs that had a cover of goose bumps and red-eyed pimples. There was a need to urinate, and Avery’s hands pushed the tips of his fingers against the base of his penis. It swelled.\n\nAt that moment, the warm light was pushing through the venetian blinds, and a white iphone on the floor was counting its last minutes before it would start up with Vivaldi’s Autumn. Avery crooked his spine to the left. He reached for his phone, and finding it just out of reach, collapsed and gave in to his imagination. He thought of Amelia, the girl in his art history class. She had pale cheeks and a thick-lipped smile. She must also have breasts with deep crimson areolas. The boy tented the bed sheets between his bent knees.\n\nThe violin began to pull. There was a stinging wetness dripping down from Avery’s fingers. Seventy seconds. The song died down. With winded inhales, he breathed deep and ugly. Only when the strings began again did the boy move towards the sink at the other end of his dorm. “Let there be light,” he said. He turned his cheek so that the void could nod approvingly. Yes, that was a funny reference. He hit the switch; his eyes recoiled from the pain first light brings. Avery washed his hands, and he started the shower in the connecting room.\n\nIn the shower, each drop of water was a small needle. Amelia came back, and Avery resigned her to an unimportant lust. This unimportance dominated his mind, the way a tragedy dominates its victim. The water continued its assault, and the boy foamed the shampoo in his hand. His mind rambled, and he applied the soapy water to his hair. Avery thought of clever things to say to Amelia. Perhaps, he would put his macbook in front of his head. I’m a surrealist painting, he might say. Water ran down his shaggy Jew fro, over the back of his thighs, kissing his Achilles’ tendon goodbye. Cici n’est pas un joke.\n\n“I’m a biology/ psychology, double major,” he might say. “I study the body and the soul.” Avery chuckled as he pulled the three-blade razor across his chin. Then blood, small stinging blood. A patch of shadow missed under the cheek. Avery didn’t invent this witticism about the body and the soul. His thesis advisor, the grey bearded Platonist had squandered the words. Avery didn’t like to think he was stealing the joke, just being ecological. Avery stepped out of the white-tiled bathroom and got ready for the day. This was Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Avery had forgotten to close his blinds, and the sun marched in wearing the grey uniform of a rainy day. Then Vivaldi started. He failed to hear that Avery’s abnormal psychology class was not until two. The dead composer played on, brash and boxy. Seventy seconds. Avery slid his hand under his bed shirt, and stroked the pitiable chest hair that grew in disconnected brambles. In minutes, his round shoulders hunched forward, and Avery twisted his neck and bent it toward the computer. There was a browser with three tabs: “pennsylvania casual encounters cl…”, “Existentialism – Wikipedia,…”, “Facebook”. Center sky now, the sun refracted itself in the apartment windows. Avery spent the next several hours looking at funny images overlaid with text, and listening to thirty-second sound bites, and reading theological internet forums about whether or not there was a god.\n\nTo get to the bank just down the hill from his dorm, Avery pulled out his red and white bicycle. It was a cheap fixed-gear rider, too small really for Avery’s mountain-like body. There was a crunch to the plane tree leaves no one ever bothered to rake together. Avery’s bicycle ran over their green bodies and smashed them against the broken cement sidewalk. The plane leaves and the way the wind stung his eyes were the only things Avery’s mind could grab. Before he knew it, he was downtown, at the bank, on his bike, and back to the university student center, ordering a Starbuck’s coffee, sitting down at an office desk. The administrative assistant, had reminded him that the work-study check was issued yesterday. “You should cash it before five-thirty,” she said. “I got it yesterday,” He replied. He added, “thanks”. \n\nThen, a pot-bellied Jesuit with a grey forked bird and think smoky glasses came out. Avery did not know his name; he was the new vice president of student ministries. The Jesuit laughed. He said Avery’s name as a way to get the boy’s attention. “I need you to make sixty copies of this passage for tonight’s bible study,” he said. “Sure,” Avery said. Between the cacophony of the copier, Avery heard the Jesuit strumming his guitar. When Avery brought the papers into the Jesuit, Avery focused on the inane details of his office: the mounted sea-bass, the byzantine icon, stacks of thick red liturgy books. The Jesuit didn’t have his collar on, and his guitar rested awkward against his thick, hairy arms. He strummed the chords to the Beatles “Come Together”.\n\nThe Jesuit looked up. He stopped on what would have been the word “monkey-finger”. Avery said, “I’ve been thinking of joining the Jesuits”. It was a stupid thing to say, and, before he had said it, Avery regretted the words.\n\nThe Jesuit let out a long word, as if a teakettle were letting out steam. “Rea-a-ally-y”. And then a question mark. And then an under breath chuckle. “Well we can talk about it,” the Jesuit said. He leaned his guitar to the side of his desk and opened a meeting book. “How does Thursday work? Eleven a.m.?” “Sure”. “Good”. Avery was not there, and his words were not his own.\n\nWhen on Wednesday Avery woke up and was in the shower before Vivaldi, he was elated. Avery emerged from his shower shaking the moisture from his body and leaving pools of dirty water around his room. He sat undressed at his computer, erased his laptop’s internet history, and deleted a folder on his desktop titled “new folder”, which had been filled with his up-to-then favorite dirty and obscene files. He had not known what he’d been thinking. “I will go to the meeting tomorrow,” he said. He emphasized the word “will”. Then he said, “and I will see if I can get something going with Amelia”. \n\nAvery confessed the plan to woo Amelia. Standing in the take-out pizza place, in front of his friends, he had actually used the word “woo”. He got the idea from watching “Much Ado” that morning, as he got ready for the day. It was the version with Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, and though Avery’s friends didn’t know his allusion, they played along. “Oh, yonder virgin needth some courage I think,” said the tall friend with the ginger beard. He laughed afterword, shaking the case of Blue Moon between his arms. “Verily,” said Avery, who handed money to the woman at the counter. \n\nA shorter friend then pushed in front of the beer case. “Well, best of luck tomorrow, dude. Is she mildly attractive,” the friend asked. “Oh the mildest,” Avery replied. “But I’ll see if she has a vaguely attractive friend for you”. “Well,” the short friend replied,” that’s tomorrow. Tonight, let’s game. Wanna Lol?” “Sure”, Avery replied, “But I can’t stay up too late. Got a meeting in the a.m.”\n\nWhat preceded Thursday morning could be seen in empty pizza boxes and the scattered Blue Moon bottles. The bottles reflected a brown light into Avery’s eyes. Although Avery was conscious, he waited for the alarm. One minute, maybe five. Maybe twenty. Until he didn’t play. Where was Vivaldi? He was dead. Avery’s white iPhone smiled, a dark black smile. Avery pushed the screen, harder and harder. There was nothing. Moving to the MacBook didn’t help, as that was also dead. After several long undetermined periods of time, the phone was plugged in. It came on and the black screen flashed with light, stating 10:55. No way to get to the Jesuit’s office, and Avery was glad. \n\nAvery was not glad that he had to explain his absence. He thought about his excuse, as he scanned through pornographic websites featuring college girls, Asian babes, and naughty shemales. I’ll tell the truth, Avery thought. The truth is the best lie. Skipping my psychology class. Next one is at three. Amelia will be there. I’ve got to do this. Avery wasted his time by lifting a ten-pound weight around and listening to an audiobook, a poor, static filled rendition of Moby Dick. “Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon his outer aspect,” the narrator read and continued. \n\nThe sun was over the hills from just outside Hyland Hall. Avery could feel evening’s coolness in his hardened fingers. He thought about the ways he could fuck up, repeated the words to make sure they were right: “Amelia, a couple of my friends are going to this house tonight.” As he said the words, Avery loosened and retightened the cap on his one-liter bottle of Diet Coke. The elevator was taking forever, and Avery watched as the red 4 became a 3, and a 2. Before it became a 1, Amelia was standing beside him. She had headphones connected to her Android. Avery could hear the bass of her music. She didn’t look at him, and he continued to move his eyes so as not to stay on her. \n\nIn the elevator, she removed her headphones. “Hey,” Avery began. “Hey back,” Amelia said. “What do you think about the midterms,” Avery asked. “Piece of cake, just re-watch Metropolis and make sure you know the Futurists,” Amelia said, and she went on “But hey! Do you know when the trip to MoMa is?” “Oh, not ‘til next month. I can remind you on Facebook,” Avery said, “Actually, I was think--” “Great! What’s your name?” Amelia asked. She had her Android out and was about to add him. Avery’s loud voice dropped. “Oh…” Avery said, “Don’t worry about it, I’ll add you.” “Great, I’m Amelia Brooks”. “I know,” Avery said. \n\nLater that night, Avery did not go out. He texted his friends with: “didn’t work.. didnt even no my name”. The short one responded: “did u ask her out tho”. Avery did not respond, nor did he add Amelia Brooks on Facebook. Rather, he glared at her Facebook and thought that not adding her was a punishment. He knew that it wasn’t, that she wouldn’t even notice, but he liked to think that. Avery had a bottle of Blue Moon in his right hand. He drank hard from it and slammed it down to show himself that he was angry. His email flashed one new message, which read. “Father Kevin Montgomery. S. J. … Missed Our Meeting Today… and delete”, Avery said. \n\nAvery opened a new tab to Craigslist, turned to casual encounters, where people go to find anonymous sexual partners. Though Avery never dared reply to someone’s posting, tonight he had the rare mixture of self-pity and intoxication, which was just enough to do something stupid. One user posted “T girl wants someone to play”. Inside the posting were the words “generous men only”, and Avery knew what that meant. \n\nFriday afternoon, after class, Avery waited outside the mall parking lot. He leaned coolly against the stair railing and ran clammy hands over the bills. Fifty. One hundred. One fifty. Two. Two fifty. Two fifty for an hour. Avery feared he wouldn’t need nearly that long. Every passer-by could be this transsexual hooker. Although the email had an attachment, her photograph was too dark, probably taken on a cheap camera. “Avery,” the prostitute said, an odd timbre in her voice. \n\nThey walked along the broken city sidewalks, Avery crushing the weeds that grew in cracks. “I’ve never done this before,” Avery said. “That’s okay”, she said, “You a college student?” “Yeah.” “I finished four years ago,” she smiled, “I couldn’t find a job. The joys of being a philosophy major,” the prostitute said. “Avery smiled back. “I’m a psychology/biology double major. I study the body and the soul.”\n\nThe couple entered the small hotel room. A brown, out-of-fashion air conditioner droned in the background. This was the Red Carpet Inn, and Avery remembered that a friend Avery had made at church camp called it “the smelly, Indian hotel”. Avery smiled nervously. The hooker smiled back. With a confident gesture, she directed him to a chair on the opposite side of the room. The prostitute turned her back and unbuttoned her striped blouse, which fell to the floor and revealed a black bra. Avery tapped the arms of the chair with the tips of his finger. Walking over to the chair, the prostitute bent down. Avery moved his clumsy hands up and down her waist. He closed his eyes and felt her large hands undo his jeans and move into his boxers. He opened his eyes and saw that her closed eyes. She used her mouth to open his, while first moving her fingers up and down the length of Avery’s penis. \n\nAvery choked a little as he began to speak, the prostitute’s bottom lip in between his. “I-- I forgot to give you the money,” he said. “No you didn’t,” she said. “Are you sure,” he said, grabbing her hand to stop the stroking. Too late. The prostitute raised the hand and closed her fingers around the globule of semen. I’m sorry was the only thing Avery knew to say. “Don’t worry,” she said and went to wash it in the bathroom sink. \n\nAvery looked at her walk away. Her back was an ugly pale, spotted with freckles. Deep lines of red ran where her bra had clutched too tight. As she washed, her elbows bent her hoary arms into half diamonds. The diamonds covered her back from which inky trees sprung up. They lowered their roots to the base of her waist, and Italian letters rested above the leaves and tattoo branches. The prostitute turned back around and lay on the bed next to Avery. \n\n“What’s on your back”,” Avery asked. She said, in perfect Italian, “It says, ‘Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura, ché la diritta via era smarrita’.” \n\n“What’s it mean,” Avery asked. “It’s from Dante”, she said, “Look it up.” She closed her eyes and stuck out her tongue. Avery sighed. \n\n“Uhg! At least it’s Saturday tomorrow,” the prostitute said. “The Jewish Sabbath. A new week,” Avery said. “Are you Jewish,” she asked. “My grandmother is,” Avery replied. \n",

    "passage": "Your New China Cabinet\n\nThe Boyd Family’s dining room smelled sweet like wet oak. It was the room that Mrs. Dorothy Boyd had giddily daydreamed of dressing up ever since she realized as a girl that the dingy picnic table that wobbled in her family’s kitchen was of a significantly lower class of living than the tables in the pictures of Versailles she saw on television. Like the rest of her home, the dining room was neatly arranged and Victorian, both aware of its own opulence and, in the words of Mrs. Dorothy Boyd’s interior designer, “exquisitely inoffensive.” Its central showpiece was the China cabinet, which was filled with pale blue porcelain dishes propped up like museum artifacts on glass stands. When Dorothy, seven months pregnant with her only child, first brought the dishware home from a private seller she’d heard about at the country club, her eyes became like the plates--pale blue, glassy, serene. She felt, as she unwrapped it from its parchment paper, that the beautifully ornate dish set of huts and wooden boats had always been meant to reside in her home, had always been a vital organ in the body of her real self. She began to walk more daintily; at dinner parties, she delivered her compliments in hushed intonations and mannered pauses with the elegant precision of a duchess speaking to the press. \n\n\nNow the China cabinet’s face was smashed into the side of the dining table, its contents exploded over the Persian rug. The initial boom of wood-to-wood and shattering glass echoed strangely when the table’s feet wailed as they were scraped across the hardwood floor. The top of the cabinet nicked the dangling glass chandelier as it fell, knocking the fixture onto the back of the cabinet before the broken bulbs slid down its smooth wood back and bashed into the wall.\n\n\nDorothy couldn’t shut her eyes any harder. Frantic, she writhed on the floor and mumbled about nightmares and cackled as she grinded her back into the broken glass. Dwight caught one look at her before bolting out the door and jumping into Caitlin’s already packed sedan. He hadn’t seen her like that since he was 10 and he was woken up by ambulance lights flooding his bedroom through the windows; his dad told him later she had gotten scared and forgot how to breath. Dwight saw her on the porch that night, murmuring that she couldn’t feel her hands as she shivered. It was the same tone she used a moment before she threw herself at the China, after Dwight told her that he was ditching his quest for a pre-law degree in order to finally “live an unmanufactured life” with the girl that had slowly been corrupting him. Dorothy’s face was still soaking with snot when Mr. Brian Boyd called his son from the other room.\n\n\n“We can talk about this. Don’t leave your mom like this,” Brian squeezed his fist and pounded it on his desk. “You’re all right with leaving your mom like this?”\n\n\n“I tried to reason with both of you. This is my only choice now. It didn’t have to be this way, goddamnit. I will see her again.”\n\n\n“Thanks for leaving me to deal with this. After everything we’ve done for you. All the vacations and the piano lessons and the nice clothes. Did it all mean nothing?” Brian’s eyes were glued to a random date on his calendar. He had been cheated, he thought. Cheated out of a real son and given a loser instead, a lazy, pretentious drifter. After all of the hours he had put in. After the soccer practices and the days he picked him up from daycare. It was all, in retrospect, a series of obligations that only held as much inherent worth as the potential of the child being nurtured. He had produced a clunker, he thought, and he’d never forgive himself for it.\n\t\n\n“I’m doing what I need to do, Dad. You guys should have added a caveat when you filled my head with ideas of ‘following my dreams’ that the only acceptable dreams were those that would make for an impressive dinner topic.” Dwight hung up the phone and walked out of the 7/11. Caitlin was wearing overalls and combat boots and no makeup (she refused to wear it). She smoked a cigarette by the ice machine and threw rocks across the barren highway. \n\t\n\n“Where are we?” Dwight scratched his eyes and took out a stick of gum.\n\t\n\n“Colorado. Not sure what the town’s called. We’ve got another day at least.”\n\t\n\n“Have you ever been to San Francisco?”\n\t\n\n“No. I’ve always loved Howl, though. The first place we should go is where it was published.”\n\t\n\nDwight smiled. “Were you right? Is your writer’s block fading now that we left?”\n\t\n\n“Oh baby, my mind was running wild even while you were still in your house. I felt like what was happening was the event I would mark my life around. I felt like the event itself was a part of me.”  Caitlin stomped her cigarette butt, stepped into the driver’s seat. “And you?” \n\t\n\n“I can’t think about writing. Their disappointment is consuming me.”\n\t\n\nCaitlin jerked her head towards Dwight, slapped him in the face. “You can’t fucking do that to yourself. We’re brave for making this decision, and don’t let anyone in a button-up tell you otherwise, not even your dad. Respect your desire enough to accept the consequences of its fulfillment.” \n\t\n\nDwight checked on the bag in the trunk of the car. It was filled with $6000, two-thirds of which came from Caitlin’s workplace at the boutique clothing store; she had used her assistant-manager key to break in after hours and steal every bit of the money onsite. Afterward, Caitlin toyed with the bills stacked in her passenger seat, each its own little sliver of freedom. She decided that night that it was time to go somewhere better. She blocked out the look on her brother’s and father’s faces when they realized that she’d gone; she blocked out the way they wouldn’t argue with her but would instead helplessly try to mentally record every darting of her eyes and every twitching of her nose before she bolted. She pretended that she lived in a world where they were already dead. She showed up sobbing at Dwight’s apartment with the bag clutched between her arms. “I did it,” she had said. “We can go anywhere. We don’t have to live this life anymore, baby. We can finally own ourselves.”\n\t\n\nDwight stared at the money. The voice inside his head had screamed that night that he should kick her out, go back to work on his case briefs. He knew that money’s most dangerous power was the way it could reduce a Van Gogh into little more than a colorful receipt of the eight figure sum paid for it. But he also knew that without it he would be trapped indefinitely, forced to submerge his real self beneath his marketable self until a hazy late night conversation let it uneasily tease the surface. He and Caitlin didn’t need money like the kids across town needed money for shoes and vaccines, he thought; they needed it like a checkers player needed to say “King me” so that he could traverse the board with unmatched freedom. This unfairness constantly warred with Dwight’s artistic desire, made his ideas seem inconsequential, selfish, misguided. Yet he knew that the unfairness of his want did not make it cease. He almost instantly decided he would go, but he felt a lump in his throat form when he realized he couldn’t leave in good conscience without telling his permanently worry-sick mother.\n\n\n“I’ve known for years that I would have to crush my parents if I was ever going to be happy,” Dwight said. “Now that it’s actually happened it feels fucking apocalyptic.”\n\t\n\nCaitlin smiled a little and cracked her window, ashing a cigarette more frequently than ash was accumulating. “You’re a bastard for waiting this long to let them down. You spent nearly all of your teenage years inflating an ideal version of yourself, just to snatch it away at the last second.”\n\t\n\n“Shut the fuck up. You don’t know what it was like to have that pressure. I love them for what they did for me, but I don’t owe them a miserable life. They just can’t see the whole picture.”\n\t\n\n“Well that’s our problem, isn’t it?” Caitlin said. “We see the whole picture when they can see only a corner. That’s why we have to bust open the frame and rip up the picture into pieces and scatter them on the floor so that each portion becomes a whole picture itself. That’s the only way to live.” \n\t\n\n“But what happens when we put the pieces back together again, and it’s the same picture?”\n\t\n\n“Then we start over. But until then you’ve just got to believe a new one is waiting for us, and once we put the pieces back together the sight of it will lift us off the ground and into another world where things aren’t broken but they aren’t too fixed, either.”\n\t\n\nA few hours later, as the sun inched across the Nevadan horizon, Caitlin perked up when she saw an exit for Reno. “My friend Edgar lives in Reno,” she said. “He owes me a favor. Let’s see if he has a couch we can pass out on until tomorrow.”\n\t\n\nEdgar’s apartment complex was a refashioned motel. It was made of grimy aluminum, and it smelled like wet rust. “I stayed here once when I ran away from home when I was 16,” she said. “I wasn’t so brave then.”\n\t\n\nThey knocked on door number 5, but they heard no one stirring. Dwight, desperate for sleep, banged on the door like he had a search warrant until a stocky old woman undid the key latch and opened the door.\n\t\n\n“Can I help you?” She rubbed her eyes.\n\t\n\n“I’m sorry, we thought our friend Edgar lived here,” Dwight said.\n\t\n\n“No, I’m afraid I took over his lease three or four years ago. You two come inside, though. I haven’t talked to anyone in weeks and you look like you could use some coffee. I’m Doris.”\n\t\n\nThe inside of the dimly lit room was filled with parchment paper covered in illegible scrawl. The only pieces of furniture were those remained from the room’s motel years: a two-seat round table, a dresser where a television used to sit, and a queen sized bed. Caitlin and Dwight sat at the table.\n\t\n\n“Where are you kids headed?” Doris tried to portion out three cups of coffee, but her hands were shaking violently and the coffee dribbled on the carpet. \n\t\n\n“San Francisco,” Caitlin said. \n\t\n\n“I lived there once when I was about your age. An interesting place, if you have a strong stomach for bullshit.”\n\n\n“I would say that we do,” Dwight smiled.\n\n\n“Why San Francisco?”\n\n\nDwight grabbed the pot and poured the coffee. “Someplace else,” he shrugged, picking up a random piece of paper. “What is this supposed to say?”\n\n\n“I knew at one point, darling,” she said. “I used to be the biggest poet in Nevada. I even turned down a screenwriting job to keep it that way. But at one point the money dried up, my arthritis destroyed the hand muscles I use to write, and everyone I knew either died or sold out. I woke up and found that my conviction was an antique.”\n\n\nCaitlin’s phone rang. It was her father. “Excuse me for a minute,” she said, as Dwight began pressing Doris on her poetry. \n\n\n“Daddy?” She said outside.\n\n\n“Caitlin. Please come home. We need you.”\n\n\n“I’m sorry. Really, I am. But I have to do this. You of all people should understand. You don’t like staying stagnant either, right? You travelled everywhere.”\n\n\n“Staying moving doesn’t keep you from being stagnant.”\n\n\n“Why are you trying to convince me so hard?”\n\n\n“It’s your brother. He ate all of the Xanax you left. He’s on suicide watch. He told me he can’t keep going without you. He needs you. I need you.”\n\n\nCaitlin’s vision blurred all around her; if her brother wanted to die she wished he had already gotten it done rather than holding her in the limbo of a “suicidal” relative. They needed her. They had always needed her. \nDwight walked out of Doris’s room. “Baby, if I told you how extraordinary Doris’s poetry was you wouldn’t believe me. You have to come inside.”\n\n\n“Let’s go. I want to drive.”\n\n\n“Go? No, you have to hear this. I’ve never heard anything like it.”\n\n\n“My brother tried to kill himself last night. Says he can’t live without me.” Caitlin stared at her shoes. “I want to get out of here.”\n\n\n“Caitlin. I wanted you to come in to hear because hearing it changed me. I can’t leave her here with no way to write. I have to stay. It’s all too perfect for me to pass it up. This was what I was meant to do. The real me is here, with her, helping her work.”\n\n\nCaitlin’s eyes welled; she knew that trying to convince Dwight was as futile as trying to convince herself. She kissed him and grabbed his hand and followed him back into the room. Doris read her poetry, and they embraced each other on the bed as they listened. Soon, in the world that Doris constructed, they felt like they had found the place that let them become themselves. They unwrapped each word as reverently as Dorothy unwrapped China. They dozed off in a place that Doris weaved with her words, and in the morning Caitlin removed herself gingerly from the bed and didn’t turn around to see the faces she was leaving as she walked out the door. She put the bag of money in the passenger seat where Dwight had sat. The Nevada desert unrolled itself in front of her. As she started the car, she could think only of how soon the money in her bag would dissipate, of how soon the day would come that Dwight would wake up to Doris’s stiff, dead body.\n",

    "passage": "THE BOOGEYMAN (1980)\nDirected by: Ulli Lommel\nWritten by: David Herschel, Suzanna Love, Ulli Lommel\nStarring: John Carradine, Ron James, Suzanna Love\n\n[]\n\n[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9tBxVqQnIo[/youtube]\n\nTHE BOOGEYMAN (AKA THE BOGEYMAN) (1980)\n\nFIRST RELEASED: 1980\n\nDIRECTOR: ULLI LOMMEL\n\nCURRENT UK STATUS: AVAILABLE UNCUT AS AN 18 CERTIFICATE\n\nThe Bogeyman was first released in UK cinemas uncut in 1980, and then Vipco released it on VHS in November 1981. In October 1983 the film was listed as a Video Nasty and removed from shelves. The Bogeyman never had the chance to build the reputation the true notorious Video Nasty’s gained due to it being dropped from the list in July 1985. Vipco then re-released it in 1992 with 44 seconds of cuts, however the film was later released uncut in 2000 certified 18. Better still, an extended cut was released in 2004 by Hollywood R2 DVD and this too was uncut and passed as 18.\n\nGerman born director Ulli Lommel originally wanted to be an actor, something which his Father Ludwig Manfred Lommel, did not approve of. At the age of just four, Ulli was put on stage in theatre by his Father, however by the age of sixteen Ulli wanted to pursue acting and so ran away from home after his Father’s disapproval of his chosen career. It was acting where Lommel got his start in the world of movies, acting in 28 plays including the lead role in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, 22 TV movies and 18 feature films. After this Lommel moved on to an inspired theatre collective, known as Rainer Werner Fassbinderand the Anti Theatre, along with a few other German actor’s including Kurt Raab, Hanna Schygulla and Margit Carstensen. Creator Fassbinder moved from theatre to films in the 1970’s and quickly became one of the leading voices in the German New Wave, and Lommel spent ten years working very closely with him. Making 41 films in 13 years, Fassbinder was well known for his prodigious output, and Lommel himself either served as producer, assistant director, production designer and even acted in a number of Fassbinder’s movies. Fassbinder died in 1982, and Lommel still travels the world taking part in retrospectives of his friend and collaborator.\n\nLommel directed his first film in 1971 titled Haytabo, and his second film, Die Zartlichkeit der Wolfe (1973) was produced by Fassbinder. The cult classic was voted one of the one thousand films to change your life in Time Out magazine. Lommel moved to New York in 1978 and began working with Andy Warhol and then in 1980 he made the move to Hollywood where he directed the Boogeyman. The horror became a huge success grossing $25 million worldwide (a lot in those days!) After the Boogeyman Lommel toyed with a few genres before settling into horror as being his main genre, and has been making a feature film almost every year since, often two of three a year! Most recently he has made films like The Tomb, Absolute Evil and Nightstalker. In 2004 Lommel set up his own repertory group in Venice, working with a number of collaborators, they have released sixteen genre films on the Lionsgate label.\n\nThe majority of the Video Nasty’s actually feel like they were made simply to be on ‘The List’, cheap, tacky and holding a minimal story for the sole purpose of simply adding the scenes of violence together. On the odd occasion one of the films on The List fits that bill, but there is something about it which makes it stand out from the rest, it feels like the film was actually made as a genuine film with violence as a necessary part of the story, and not just a cheap shock fest looking for notoriety. Granted The Boogeyman does contain plenty of violence and shock tactics, but there is a quality about this film, and it actually has a very engaging and interesting story which, in places, catches you off guard. In this film the killer is more a supernatural Demon, haunting the mirrors of a broken Brother and Sister and hungry for revenge. The Brother and Sister had a traumatic childhood, with a Mother who would rather get drunk and have sex than look after them. The opening scene of the film see’s the Mother in a sexual clinch with another man, a man who bullies the kids and decides to tie up the Son because he was watching them through a window. The bullying has to stop, and so the Son breaks free and murders them both. It is a creepy opening scene, there is little music and the man has a sinister stocking on his head which adds a whole new level of unease as we watch helplessly the tortured kids.\n\n[]\n\nSome years later the kids have grown up, Willy (Nicholas Love) is mute but gets a job working happily on the farm of the family they now live with. Lacey (Suzanne Love) looks after Willy, but is terrified of mirrors as it was in a mirror she witnessed the murders as a child. While seeing a psychiatrist Lacey freaks out at the thought of mirrors and screams. It is clear there is still some deep rooted trauma for these two kids, and things are about to get a whole lot worse. We learn that Willy is not normal and scared now of women after a young, attractive girl advances on him in a barn. Panicking, Willy decides to strangle her until she runs off, the poor lad not knowing his own strength and unable to communicate. He felt threatened and all he knew to do was be aggressive. See, already we are building up a story, a level of realism in a way, that many Video Nasty’s did not bother with. The Boogeyman draws you in, becomes quite sinister and you do start to build relationships with the poor victims. Further into the film a mirror in the house is smashed and now things turn a little strange, and things begin to get bloody. The Boogeyman, see, is a spirit living in the mirrors and now it is free to cause mayhem, and it does exactly that.\n\n[]\n\nWhat I really liked about this film is that it is not your average 80’s slasher, this is actually quite inventive due to the fact the ‘killer’ doesn’t exactly kill it’s victims, more causes accidents or forces them to commit suicide. Its a clever idea and it really works and leads to some quite nasty scenes. The first suicide comes in a disturbing bathroom scene. Already the mood has been set by Lommel’s brilliant camera work. The camera follows its victims around, becomes almost intrusive as it spies on a young, sexy girl in the shower. Suddenly you feel like maybe you shouldn;t be watching in such a perverse way, and as the camera suddenly hides behind a wall as the girl looks over, its clear Lommel is up to some kind of clever trickery, we suddenly realise that this is actually a Point of View shot, of the killer? Anyway, the poor girl suddenly grabs a pair of scissors and stabs herself in the neck on a glorious scene of everything the Video Nasty’s stood for, gratuitous violence coupled with naked breasts!! Well, of course her dressing gown had to fall off, why wouldn’t it! In one of the funniest and most bizarre scenes I have EVER seen in a horror, a little boy, clearly wanting to spy on a naked girl appear at the bathroom window, laughs and screams out something like “FLEA BAGS!” and no sooner has he said it, the window comes crashing down on his head in a terrible choreographed scene that is so ridiculously bad it is genius! The film then carries on with one death after another, including some teenagers on holiday where a girls and her boyfriend end up ‘spiked’ together whilst kissing. For thirty or so minutes its one nasty death after another and you feel that just maybe Lommel ran out of ideas, but then he delivers a shock ending that has to be seen to be believed. The mirrors comes into play once again, and an actually very scary scene involving a woman and a demonic voice wraps up the film superbly. Special lighting effects are used to create a strong supernatural atmosphere and, believe it or not, the clear budget restraints actually make the whole thing look better. Sometimes its the simple things we appreciate. The parting shot of the film is a creepy one indeed, and will probably haunt you for a few days after.\n\n[]\n\nSo, The Boogeyman, a Video Nasty that is very very nasty, but is actually very very good too. This is a film that should be seen by all horror fans, young and old as it is, in my mind anyway, a genre classic that does everything it can with what it has, and delivers a clever, sinister and creepy little violent horror that can stand proud with the best of what the 80’s horror had to offer!\n\nRATING: [★][★][★][★][★][★][★][★][☆][☆]\n\nSHOULD THE BOOGEYMAN HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE VIDEO NASTY’S LIST? STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW WITH CERTAIN SCENES WHICH WOULD HAVE AT LEAST WARRANTED BEING CUT IN THOSE DANGEROUS TIMES!\n",

    "passage": "[TH] Then there were seven\n\nIt was the middle of the night and I thought it was a good idea after the eighth bottle of whiskey. A few of my friends were over, seven to be exact. We all were boozing for quite some time when one of my good friends shouted in the way an overly excited drunk would shout “Lets play some Russian Roulette.” this suggestion was when I was on my third bottle of whiskey and it was just touching 10′ o clock. I was tipsy but I had my wits about me and told him to simmer down or what a decent drunk would say “Shut the fuck up.” to such an atrocious idea like that. He sat down and drank deeply from his glass, looking up at me he said “I am sorry, I guess I am just a little drunk.” giving me a weak smile. I smiled back at him. The usual drunken talks came alive after this incident and the discussion was upon death. “Death is the final frontier.” said one of my friends. “Death is the end. We must live life to the fullest.” said another. Yet another said, “Death is the end of one life and the start of another.” “Death is the journey to the after life.” “Death is the end.” “Death is the start.” So many opinions but only one common link. It was a grim idea. I was on my fifth bottle of whiskey when I gave my opinion. “Death is a sad thing.” There was silence for a minute and each of my friends looked up at me, concern clearly written on their faces. I smiled at them and slowly stood up, my legs were a little shaky but I stood my ground. I raised my glass and looked at each of them “Death is a sad thing. Not for the one who died but for the one who was left to mourn. All of you have lost someone, near and dear to you. To you I raise you my glass. They are in a better place and you will soon be with them too.”\n\nI smiled and gulped down my drink. All of their faces were ashen and I started laughing. “Not right now, calm down.” their laugh seemed forced. The drinking continued. I walked towards my old record player and looked down at it. I pulled out an old vinyl, one of my favorites. “Astrud Gilberto – Light my fire.” I fired up the record player and the sound of her voice filled the room. It shook the glasses on the showcase as though they too were enjoying the rhythm of her voice. The room was filled with the smell of booze, laughter and Astruds beautiful voice. The alcohol must have been getting to me because the room started to spin and the color strangely started becoming golden. I couldn’t hear the sounds. I sat down on my chair and started to drink. I couldn’t hear the ice clinking on my glass, I couldn’t hear the sound of the whiskey being poured, I couldn’t hear the drunken laughs of my friends. I started to get angry and drank even more. I saw the smiles on my friends faces and I felt a white hot anger come over me. I stood up and threw my glass at the wall. The shattering of the glass followed by me shouting “What are you all fucking laughing at!”\n\nI couldn’t even hear that. I knew what I said but my voice was not audible to me. I fell back into my chair and saw the faces of my friends, unsmiling. It was 11:30. I walked to the kitchen and picked up another glass and sat back down. I poured myself a drink. I was on my seventh bottle. I knew this happened before, this was not the first time. I remembered a time when I did this, it was a  year ago. My little darling, Sarah, she was only seven. She was wearing that pretty frock I got her for her birthday and that tiara, she was pretending to be a princess. She always smiled at everyone and everything. Such a sweet and innocent girl. Why did I have to fight with her mother that day? Why? Why did I have to drink? Why? Why did I get angry? Why? Why did my little girl have to die? Why? Why did she have to die by my hands? Why?WHY?WHY?WHY?\n\nMy mind started to spiral down into this chasm. It was dark and scary. I was alone. My wife called me a murderer. I wasn’t, I wasn’t a killer. I would never hurt little Sarah. She kept screaming at me, she kept calling me a murderer. I wasn’t a murderer. I was just drunk. The tears started to roll down my face, I missed my daughter the most today. It was 11:55. I was on my eight bottle now. I smiled. In another 5 minutes it would be my daughters birthday. 7/7/1998. That was her birthday. See, I still remember. I am a good father. I was also a good husband but then she left me. Sarah’s mother. What was her name again?\n\nIt was 11:58.\n\nI rose from my chair and almost fell down. I didn’t realize that I had a lot to drink. I looked at my friends and told them “My mates, my friends. We have gone through a lot together. We have got each others backs. We have seen the best years of our lives as well as the worst years of our lives. As you all know I have recently lost my beloved little girl, Sarah. I miss her terribly. Her mother on the other hand, can go fuck herself. She probably is at this point…” I laughed. My friends did not.\n\n“Anyway, one of you had said that you would like to play Russian Roulette. Right now it seems like a good idea. So, lets do it.” I walked to my bedroom door and went over to my study. I pulled a drawer and got out two guns. I looked for my ammunition box and took that along with me as well. I stood in the center of the room and loaded the guns. They were magnum revolvers with a container that could hold seven bullets. I loaded one completely and the other with one bullet. I spun the chamber. I looked at my friends and said “Now, all of you sit in a circle.” They obliged. I smirked and thought to myself “Everyone listens to a guy with a gun.”\n\n“I have a fully loaded gun here with me and I will give you this gun.” I said as I motioned to the revolver with only one bullet. “You each will spin the chamber and try to shoot me. If you don’t, I shoot you. If I die, you all will win. If you all die, then I win.” None of them spoke but their eyes betrayed them. They were fearful. What cowards I thought. I gave the revolver to the person to my right. For the life of me I couldn’t remember his name. I pointed my gun at him and said “Start.” He spun the chamber and cocked the gun, his hands started to shake as he pointed his gun at me. He pulled the trigger. It was empty.\n\n“Ahh too bad. Pass the gun along.” I couldn’t remember the next persons name either. I kept my gun pointed at him and said “Go on.” He too spun the chamber. He started to point the gun at me but then put it down. “You are being insane…” I shot him. The blood was everywhere and all I said was “Next.” None of them moved for the gun. They really must not want to win. I shot the first guy. His body too hit the floor. The blood intertwined with the other. I looked at this colorful picture for a second and felt a sudden pang of guilt followed by a maniacal pleasure. Am I killer?\n\n“Next.”\n\nThey all scrambled for the gun this time. The guy with the blue shirt took it. He spun the chamber and pointed the gun at me. He pulled the trigger. It was empty. I shot him. My friends started to freak out. “A change of rules. if you don’t kill me you die.” I pointed my gun at the guy with the ponytail hair. “Your turn.” He took the gun, the tears were streaming down his face, it was pathetic. “Get on with it.” He pointed the gun. It was empty too. *bang* another one bites the dust. I started to laugh a little and pointed my gun to the next guy. “Only four of you left. You guys don’t want to win do you?” He took the gun and spun the chamber. Suddenly the guy on my left got up and went for the door. He didn’t get far. I shook my head and said “Why does he always cheat? cheating isn’t fun.” I look back and motioned him to continue the game. He wasn’t lucky either.\n\nNow there were only two of my good old buddies left. “I really have to say that this is the most fun I have had in a long time. You guys are losing but that’s all part of the game. Still, a chance exists. Give it a shot.” I started to laugh hysterically. This guy had the bluest eyes I knew, but now it was stained with red. ‘Probably because of the drinking’ thought I. He spun the chamber and pointed the gun at me. It was empty. I shot and the wonderful blood red color started to flow.\n\nNow it was down to my last friend. “You are the only hope. You have one bullet and so do I. Why not make it fun and lets both spin the chamber? Yes, that would be a good idea.” I spun the chamber and pointed the gun at him, smiling that stupid grin. He too did the same, not smiling though. “On the count of three.” “One…” His hands started to shake, mine were rock steady. “Two..” Sweat was pouring out of him, I was calm and steady. “Three…” The last thing I remembered was the sound of a gunshot and then darkness. I did not feel pain, I actually did not feel anything. I was simply at rest, I supposed this was where you would go after you die. A place so dark and quiet that nothing but the tranquil sound of silence seemed to ebb into your soul. This was suddenly shattered when I heard\n\n“Daddy….”",

    "passage": "[AA} Three Unwise Men\n\nIt was late in September 1974, and snow already threatened Winnipeg. I knew no one, so I   checked into the YMCA, secured a job as a gas pump attendant, and with that security rented an apartment on River Avenue. I had accumulated a small amount of cash working for the Hudson's Bay Company in Eskimo Point, N.W.T., even though I was paid minimum wage for a year. But, of course, you don’t spend too much money in the sub-arctic – just bullets and hunting supplies. With my new found wealth I purchased a faded blue Ford Custom, a burly beast of an automobile that looked as though it had once been a cop car. The power of its engine was of little concern to me – I was more thrilled it had a radio that actually worked. I unimaginatively christened her Winnie. \n\nWinnie was also appreciated by my two new buddies, Larry, who I had met at the YMCA and who now shared the apartment with me, and Pete, who had also come across from England to work for the Hbc, and had, coincidentally, quit the Company at the same time. The three of us were restless. I had just heard that my brother and his wife in Nova Scotia had become parents for the first time. It was also getting close to Christmas. So we quit our casual jobs and planned to drive to the east coast and see my brother and his new born for the holidays – two thousand miles across the continent. I had never driven in ice and snow before.\n\nThe night before our departure two street wise characters that lived on the floor above us in the River Street apartment approached us with an offer. They had “acquired” numerous cases of frozen Cornish hens that, as the Brits would say, “Had fallen off the back of a lorry”.  Their living room was stacked with them floor to ceiling, and melting fast.  Did we want to buy a couple of cases? They were cheap. And so we bought three cases (about seventy two hens) and cooked the birds in numerous shifts overnight so we would have food for the road without stopping or spending our limited cash. We sub-let the apartment to a mutual friend who also looked after the rest of our personal possessions.  We filled the car with bags of cooked hens, pickled onions and doughnuts (I don’t know why we had pickled onions and doughnuts but we did.) The trunk was packed with one suitcase each and three milk crates full of my vinyl records. They were more important than extra clothes. We headed south to the border crossing at Grand Forks, North Dakota as Larry, being the only Canadian thought it a good idea to go south of the Great Lakes in winter.\n\nOur first trouble occurred at the American border. The immigration guards asked for our passports, our business and our destination.  Pete and I had our UK documents, but Larry only had his Canadian driver’s license, which in those days was enough to get you across the border. We must have appeared a strange group of individuals: two Englishmen fresh from the Canadian wilderness, and a slightly older Canadian, on a carefree journey across North America in the middle of winter. They processed our names through their computers. A couple of minutes later they asked Larry to step out of the car and come into the office. A guard then asked me to pull the car over to the side of the road so they could search it. Something big was going on. While the officer started to go through the car with its bags of cooked Cornish hens, chicken bones, suitcases, and my collection of records we could see Larry being grilled in the office. The guards found nothing stronger than pickled onions and resonant farts. After about forty five minutes they let us go. I think they were disappointed. Not too much to do at the North Dakota border crossing three days before Christmas.\n\nBack on the road Larry told us what had happened. During a stay at the Y.M.C.A. in Winnipeg a fellow traveler from Jamaica, that Larry had befriended,  had “borrowed” his passport (unbeknownst to him) to go to Detroit to visit a relative. He naively got as far as the border, proudly pulled out on the Canadian passport, but of course his skin colour was black and Larry’s was white. Hello!!! There was now a red flag against Larry’s name on immigration records. As for Larry, he had wondered what had happened to his passport. Now he knew. He thought he would get around to replacing it when he was heading somewhere exotic, not Grand Forks!\n\nThe three of us took shifts: one would drive, one would navigate, and one would sleep. We didn’t stop. As each hour went by the bags of Cornish hens became smaller and smaller, as did the jar of pickled onions. The smell in the car was more than ripe, but we were having fun. As we drove through the night and the snow we continually flipped the dial on the car radio for the elusive local music stations and hopefully some good tunes. We would sing along to such repeated hits as “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” by Elton John, “I Can Help” by Billy Swan, and the most played song of all “Mandy” by Barry Manilow. We howled the chorus at the top of our lungs like drunken hockey players on a Saturday night binge as the Ford Custom sped through the silent darkness of backwoods America. \n\nDuring my shift of sleep in the back seat I was suddenly disturbed by a huge jolt. I awoke groggily to find that the right side of the car had tilted into a snow covered ditch. Larry had pulled over in the darkness to change drivers not realizing that a trough, full of fresh snow, ran parallel to the dark road. He had pulled over too far and now one side of the car was tilted into a snow filled ditch. We were stuck in the middle of nowhere. There was not a house, a light, a car to be seen. It was two o’clock in the morning. As we gunned the engine the back wheel just spun and spun in the fresh snow. We ventured into the nearby woods and gathered up pine branches, and wedged them under the tires in a hope for some traction but it was no good. We were hopelessly stranded. It was cold, dark, snowing, and we had only the vaguest idea where we were on the map.\n\nAfter what seemed like forever we could see the amber flashing lights of a snow grater coming towards us. Relief! We waved down the driver, explained the situation, and\nasked for help. Could he pull us out? That was against regulations, he said. He then asked us where we were going. Nova Scotia we told him. He laughed heartily, commented on how crazy we were, got down from his cab, hitched a chain from his vehicle to ours and pulled us out. We thanked him with as much gratitude as we could muster. “Good luck,” he said. “You’re going to need it,” and drove off in the opposite direction. We were on our way again, but our troubles were not over. I was now driving and noticed that the gas tank was almost empty. We kept going, praying that we would find a gas station still open in the middle of the night. A couple of miles down the road we did find one, isolated and lonely, but it was closed. We pulled in. The worst case scenario was that we would stay there till morning and wait for it to open – provided we were still alive and didn’t freeze in our sleep. It appeared the owner of the station lived upstairs. So we knocked on the door of the business as loud as we could. A voice bellowed out from an upstairs window: “Whose there? What do you want?” In thick English accents we told him we were tourists on a driving holiday working our way to Nova Scotia. It worked. The owner, bless him, came down in his pajamas, with his parka on top, opened the pumps, filled the tank, and told us we were crazy. Second time in about an hour that phrase had come up. Maybe we were. We paid him, gave him a big tip, and thanked him very much. We were off again. But our troubles were not over. By morning we were speeding down the highway heading into Detroit. Larry was driving. We were making good time anxious to get to my brother’s place by Christmas. There was a turn off towards the motor city that we had to negotiate. As we rounded the curve we hit black ice. The car suddenly started to do multiple 360s. We were spinning out of control.  We must have done a half dozen “doughnuts”. It was terrifying. There was nothing we could do. Luckily, there were few cars about and we came to rest on the highway margin. No damage except to our nerves. After that we were extremely cautions not only with our speed, but we filled up whenever the needle on the gas tank indicator pointed to half full.\n\nWe crossed the border back into Canada. After a few hours sleep and a snack, Pete, Larry and I (plus the remaining Cornish Hens) were back on the Trans Canada Highway bound for the Maritimes. We made it through the confusion of the Montreal road system, the snow of New Brunswick, and eventually to the famous port city of Halifax Nova Scotia. I remembered that my brother lived about twenty miles along the coast in a place called Boutlier’s Point. A number of helpful locals gave us directions and we made it to the village. There was a Red and White store still open and went in and asked if the owners knew my brother. They did!  (Oh, the joys of a small community.) And they allowed us to use the phone in the store to call him. He drove up to meet us and we followed him back to his house. It was Christmas Eve. We had made it. The Cornish hens and the pickled onions were devoured. The car was smelly. So were we. But we had arrived safely and it was a thrill to see my brother, his wife and their new born at such a wonderful time of the year.\n\nEarly in January 1975 we put all our stuff back in the trunk of the car and headed west. The weather was now extremely bad. It was dark. The falling snow hypnotized us, illuminated in the beams of our headlights. The windscreen wipers swished back and forth non-stop. At one point the car was not handling well and I commented that the roads must be icy. There were no other vehicles around so I stopped in the middle of the road, opened the door to check how bad conditions were, took one step outside, and landed flat on my back. The road could have doubled as an ice rink. I got back in the driver’s seat and proceeded cautiously. We were thankful to eventually get back on the Trans Canada which had been salted. There were few cars around (people were sensible and staying home), but lots of trucks. While we poodled along at a slow speed the trucks, whose drivers seemed to ignore the conditions, overtook us and as they did so they sprayed brown slush all over the windshield. You couldn’t see anything. The wipers were furiously working at top speed to clear the muck, but for a number of seconds we had no idea what was in front of us. I held on to the steering wheel and prayed there was nothing in front.\n\nWe arrived in Winnipeg in early January just before an intense winter storm hit the city. You could see the dark clouds gathering on the horizon like a cancerous tumor on an X-ray. We were welcomed to stay at our old apartment by our friend until the storm blew over, and that was a lucky thing because it turned into an event of historical proportions. It snowed for two days non-stop. The city was shut down. The only vehicles on Portage Avenue were skidoos. It was as if the arctic had followed me south. We were restricted to the apartment just like I had been in the staff house at Eskimo Point. The rock station on the FM radio broadcast emergency messages for those people that were desperate for medicine or food. It was during this dark period that Pete decided he would re-join the Hudson’s Bay Company. His ninety day grace period that the company allowed him was almost up, and as the deadline approached he gave serious thought to his future (unlike Larry and I).  After the storm passed we once again packed Winnie’s trunk with the suitcases and the milk crates of records. With some sadness we said goodbye to Pete who headed north to Red Sucker Lake and a career that would last twenty years as a Hudson’s Bay manager. Larry and I drove west with the radio on one more time following the bright, unseen star of adventure.\n",

After a long while, a police van pulled up and helped them get the car out of the ditch. \nDeep into the journey, the car was running out of gas in the middle of the night. They found an isolated gas station but the group was unwilling to wait until morning in case they sleep and freeze to death. Fortunately, the owner of the station lived upstairs of the building and the friends had to persuade him to come downstairs and sell gas to them. The man grudgingly agreed. They thanked him and gave him a huge tip.",

    "passage": "Demonstrators, some dressed as robots, campaign for the basic income in Zurich Keystone\n\nAs anxiety grows about technological disruption, the idea of a guaranteed basic income is being embraced by union leaders, libertarians and Silicon Valley executives. Is this the future of welfare?\n\nThis content was published on May 27, 2016 - 10:54\nSwitzerland’s traditionally conservative electorate will next month vote on the superficially preposterous idea of handing out an unconditional basic income of SFr30,000 ($30,275) a year to every citizen, regardless of work, wealth or their social contribution.\n\nOpinion polls suggest the June 5 referendum will be heavily defeated. And even if some kind of electoral convulsion results in the proposal being unexpectedly approved by voters, it is certain to be shot down by the 26 cantons that would have to implement it.\n\nBut the fact that one of the world’s most prosperous countries is holding such a vote highlights how a centuries-old dream of radical thinkers is seeping into the political mainstream. In countries as diverse as Brazil, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and India, local and national governments are experimenting with the idea of introducing some form of basic income as they struggle to overhaul inefficient welfare states and manage the social disruption caused by technological change.\n\nDaniel Häni, a chirpy Basel entrepreneurwho is one of the Swiss initiative’s main supporters, said modern welfare states provide basic social support but are failing to adapt to the needs and values of our times. The trouble is that they are too costly and cumbersome, assume that a citizen’s worth is determined solely by their value as an employee and rely on means testing by an overly intrusive state.\n\n“Our social system is 150 years old and is based on Bismarck’s response to Industrialisation 1.0,” he said. “Our idea is simple. We want to render the conditional unconditional. UBI is about shifting power back to the citizen.”\n\n\nSupport for citizens\n\nThe idea of providing money for nothing to all citizens dates back centuries and was nurtured by a radical cult before resurfacing in recent times. In the 20th century it was championed by thinkers on the left, such as John Kenneth Galbraith and Martin Luther King, as a means of promoting social justice and equal opportunity. But it was also backed by some libertarians and economists on the right, including Milton Friedman, as a way of restricting the coercive state and restoring individual choice and freedom.\n\nIncredible as it seems today, President Richard Nixon came very close to implementing a negative income tax (a variant of basic income) across the US in 1970. Nixon’s initiative, part of his Family Assistance Plan, was strongly backed by the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate, where some Democrats considered it unambitious, and several Republicans considered it too bold.\n\nInterest in the idea has surged in recent years largely thanks to the technological revolution, which is convulsing labour markets worldwide. The decoupling in many countries of median household income growth from expansion in gross domestic product has created a sense of middle class crisis, fuelling anger over inequality and the rise of populism in the US and Europe. Whether it is because of a sense of guilt at the upheavals they are causing in society or simply a celebration of innovative thinking, some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have taken to the idea of a universal basic income, describing it as a “digital dividend”.\n\nAt a conference in Zurich this month on technological disruption and social change, a succession of speakers from the US warned about further turmoil in the jobs market resulting from the automation of routine tasks, the application of machine learning and the rise of robots.\n\nCiting just one of many examples, Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union, said the introduction of self-driving trucks and cars would eliminate millions of jobs. At present, there are about 3.5m truck drivers in the US, forming the largest job category in 29 states. “There is the potential for the greatest disruption of jobs in the history of the world,” said Mr Stern, author of Raising the Floor, a forthcoming book advocating UBI as a partial solution.\n\nErik Brynjolfsson, an MIT professor and co-author of The Second Machine Age, said a convulsive “tech surge” was under way that was rapidly turning the promise of science fiction into a reality. But he insisted that technology remained the tool of humans and could be an enormous benefit so long as it was properly managed. With robots doing most of the work, he painted a picture of a “digital Athens” in which people had time to focus on sport and the arts.\n\nHe also warned of the potential for enormous upheaval if societies did not anticipate these challenges and adequately respond to them. “I can see revolution and violence and the failure of a lot of big companies. Our economy and political system has not adapted to this new world at all and we need to get out in front of it,” he said.\n\nRobert Reich, a former Labour secretary in the Clinton administration who teaches at University of California, Berkeley, said the digital revolution was increasing economic insecurity and inequality. The development of car-hailing apps, such as Uber and Lyft, had brought great convenience for consumers but was also creating a “spot auction market” for labour.\n\nThis insecurity was fuelling too a crisis of aggregate demand in the economy, he said, adding that recently he had been visited by the boss of a tech group worried about who would have enough money to buy his company’s products in 10-15 years.\n\n\nCost-benefit analysis\n\nA more equal division of the fruits of the technological revolution would revive that demand while providing a broader social good. The aim of all rich societies, Mr Reich said, should be to provide a basic level of subsistence, enabling people to do more of what they wanted and less of what they did not want to do. For all these reasons, he said: “I think that UBI is inevitable.”\n\nEven if many experts agree about the scale and intensity of the technological and economic challenge, they remain divided about the appropriate social and political response. There is still less consensus about how it could be implemented and funded.\n\nThe resistance to the idea of introducing UBI in Switzerland - a recent GFS poll found 71 per cent of respondents were inclined to reject it - is instructive. It is far from obvious that the Swiss social model is broken and in need of repair. Switzerland remains one of the richest and most productive economies in the world. Its much-praised apprenticeship system generates a steady stream of well-trained employees and provides opportunities for all. Its unemployment rate is just 3.6 per cent.\n\nVania Alleva, a Swiss trade union leader, said it is worth debating the possible benefits of UBI and the principles of a just society but she does not see the need for such radical change. “We are critical of UBI. We have a social system in Switzerland that works,” she says.\n\nLabour leaders elsewhere remain equally wary of introducing UBI, fearing it might only be used by rightwing politicians to shred the existing welfare state. By setting the rate too low and withdrawing other welfare benefits, it could end up hurting the very people it was designed to help most. As one participant in the Zurich conference put it, there was a danger of “fattening the frogs to feed the snakes”.\n\nMany executives are also lukewarm about the idea, objecting to the delinkage of economic reward and effort. It is notable that support for UBI is lowest in the predominantly German-speaking cantons of Switzerland where the work ethic is particularly strong.\n\nUlrich Spiesshofer, chief executive of the engineering company ABB, says: “There has to be a basic level of social provision for people in need but beyond that, economic rewards should be based on actually creating economic value.”\n\n\nPicking up the bill\n\nThe government estimates full implementation of UBI would cost SFr208bn, about three times current annual federal spending of about SFr67bn. Even then, it would not replace all existing social services, such as healthcare for the elderly.\n\nAlain Berset, a Social Democrat member of the Swiss cabinet, has described the UBI initiative as “utopian”, saying it would require significant extra funding of at least SFr25bn. \n\n“The unconditional basic income would be a risky experiment. It’s not clear how this basic income would be designed by parliament or how it would be financed. The precise implications are unknown,” he said in an interview.\n\nSupporters of UBI accept many of these criticisms and are launching pilot projects to help answer the objections. One of the most interesting initiatives is in Finland and basic income will be rolled out on a national scale if the experiment proves effective.\n\nThe centre-right government will this year begin making tax-free monthly payments of about €550 to a random sample of 10,000 adults of working age as part of a two-year experiment. The intention is to see what effect a basic income has on work incentives and life choices and how it interacts with the existing welfare model. The city of Utrecht, and 19 other municipalities across the Netherlands, are conducting similar experiments.\n\nMatthew Taylor is chief executive of the RSA, a British institution that looks for practical solutions to social challenges, that recently published a\nstudy on the viability of UBI. He said societies will need to become a lot more innovative in the face of the latest technological revolution. In particular, far more flexible ways will have to be found to support part-time workers or those who wish to retrain or look after their children or elderly parents.\n\n“What excites me about UBI is that it could act as a catalyst for a broader shift in public attitudes,” he said. “I think that UBI can potentially help overcome the attitudes that we have between strivers and skivers. It can help the state enable people to have autonomous lives.”\n\nWhile acknowledging the near- certainty of defeat in the coming referendum, the Swiss backers of UBI believe that their campaign signals the beginning of a global debate on basic income, rather than its end. It may be premature to introduce UBI today but its appeal will grow as societies learn to prize creativity over productivity.\n\nMr Häni said that, irrespective of the result, he is delighted that every Swiss newspaper has been furiously discussing the principles of a basic income. He said the Swiss debate is like a movie trailer for the main event and “trailers always end with the phrase: coming soon . . . ”\n\n\nBack to basics: An idea long in the making\n\nThe Basic Income Earth Network, which links campaigners around the world, traces the original concept of basic income back to Thomas More (above), the 15th-century humanist scholar and author of Utopia, who wrote about the need for a minimum income.\n\nBut BIEN suggests that the true father of the idea of a guaranteed minimum income was Johannes Ludovicus Vives, a Spanish-born humanist and close friend of More.\n\nAfter fleeing the Spanish inquisition, Vives moved to Bruges, where he wrote tracts in support of the poor. “Even those who have dissipated their fortunes in dissolute living - through gaming, harlots, excessive luxury, gluttony and gambling - should be given food, for no one should die of hunger,” he wrote.\n\nThe idea was developed by the 18th-century radical Thomas Paine (above), who argued that every person should receive £15 on their 21st birthday and £10 a year thereafter to be paid out of “ground rent”.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, the 19th century utilitarian philosopher, wrote sympathetically about the idea of a basic income in his Principles of Political Economy, although he did not develop the concept.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist James Meade argued for a “social dividend” in the 1930s as a means of alleviating poverty and creating a just and efficient economy. In 1962 the American economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman (right) argued for a radical simplification of the welfare state and introduction of a “negative income tax”.\n\nJay Hammond, the Republican governor of Alaska, created the Alaska Permanent Fund in 1976 to distribute some of the proceeds of the state’s oil wealth to all its residents. Every Alaskan still receives a dividend of about $2,000 a year in what is arguably the only full universal basic income system in operation. The poverty and inequality levels in Alaska are among the lowest in the US.\n\n\nSpeed read\n\nGrowing insecurity - UBI’s proponents say a more equal division of the gains made by technology would lift demand\n\nProductive economy - Although Swiss will vote on a UBI, many insist that the country’s social model works well\n\nTests in Europe - Finland is running a pilot scheme; Utrecht and other Dutch municipalities are holding similar trials\n\nEnd of insertion\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2016\n \n\nThis article was automatically imported from our old content management system.

    "passage": "[FN] Ornell's Adventure\n\nThe first rays of the mornings sun sting my face as I awake from a long restless sleep. I have grown used to the lack of rest. Ever since it happened.. My brother was taken by a group of bandits notoriously known as \"The Smiling Men.\" I stare into the mirror hanging on the wall, what I see in the reflection shocks me, when did I start looking so rugged. I see my short brown hair, stubble out of control, scars cover my body. A product of the life I lead. I take one last long look into the bright blue eyes I share with my brother before I turn away. As I sit on the bed, I can't  help but wonder how my brothers family is faring, I must do something to bring him back. I get up and dress in my favorite garb, a long black trench coat with a round brim hat.  I must save my brothers life. Today is the day I set out on my journey. Today is the day I bring my brother back safely to his family. \n\n\tI grab my sword down from the wall, scoop up all the coins I have left, and head through the door. As I walk through the lively village,   I look around at all the people moving through their lives, no purpose, no goals, just passing the time until they die, sad really. Although I suppose I have always had a nhilistic view towards this shithole called Earth. I leave the village and prepare myself for the struggle ahead.\n\n\tI walk along a lonely stretch of road, trees in abundance. As I approach a particularly ominous section of the area, I grow weary. I see a large burly looking man step out from behind a large tree. Here I am, just travelling along the road minding my own business, and come across some confident little crook looking to rob innocent travelers. He comes strutting up to me, he might have a few brigands waiting, I must remain cautious .. \"Give me your gold and you'll be on your way.\" I reply with \"Try and take it.\" He was too slow on the draw, I drove my sword straight into his chin and he crumples lifelessly as his last bit of consciousness quickly slips away. A stir of movement from the trees and now I am surrounded by 4 angry foes, all with swords drawn, what a fantastic start to the day I think to myself as I size up my enemies. The first one lunges and I dodge to the side, kicking his left leg out simultaneously, I twirl around steel flashing as I catch the second one in the hip. He falls to the ground maimed. As I am distracted with him the other two rush me, a flurry of steel, blow after blow, I parry and dance around them all. One drops his guard for just a moment and I quickly seize opportunity ducking a blow and driving my sword straight through his heart, he drops and takes my sword with him. I quickly pull the dagger out of his belt and duck just in time to avoid a sword wooshing past my head, I jump on the attacker and drive my dagger straight through the eyehole in his visor. Now there is one. He hesitates slightly, having witnessed the entire battle with his friends, a quick burst of confidence causes him to charge me full force with his sword in the air, rookie mistake. I side step him and pull my sword out of his comrades breast. A quick parry and slash and now 5 lay dead around me. Child's play. I take what I need from their corpses, the dead have no need for earthly possessions, and I'm once again on my way.\n\n\tI sit in a pub, in the corner of a dimly lit room, drinking ale and observing everyone around me. I might as well stay here for a night, a nice alternative to the cold hard ground. As I am draining the last bit of ale, I hear my name being called. \"ORNELL!!\" As a familiar face comes walking up to me, \"Aldo! I didn't expect to run into you here.\" Aldo was a fellow mercenary, and probably the closest thing I have to a friend. He has medium length straight hair and carries a Two-Handed greatsword. We have fought side by side in many battles, a hardened warrior.  \"What are you doing so far from home, Ornell?\" Aldo asks, curiosity teeming in his voice. \"I am looking for information about The Smiling Men, I have some business that needs to be conducted with them.\" Aldo looks at me with those piercing green eyes \"The Smiling Men? Ornell, don't tell me you are looking for a fight, you know how ruthless they are, and you know more than anyone how dangerous Oudin is.. They say he is the best killer alive..\" I nod nonchalantly and stare into my cup, questioning whether or not I could trust Aldo. \"They have taken my brother.\"\n\n\tI rise before the sun, having overheard information about the bandits the night before I am determined to follow the lead. I get dressed and head out the door, I pull my hat down so it covers most of my face and walk slowly through the street, looking for my mark. This town is ratty, most buildings appear to be unfit for human inhabitation. As I observe my surroundings I feel the familiar distaste brought to me by these zombie-like poor excuses for human beings. I can't stand the site of people wasting the potential of life sitting around waiting to die. I belie- wait, I think I found who I am looking for. As I see him slowly teeter into view, I knew this would be an easy task, I quickly duck into an alleyway as not to be seen prematurely. As soon as he rounds the corner I wrap one hand around his throat, and pull him into the alleyway. I toss him to the ground and put my sword to his throat. \"So here's the deal, you are going to tell me everything you know about Oudin, and The Smiling Men, and I am going to give you a quick death.\" The despair is evident in his croaky voice. \"I- I- I don't know anything!\" I smile slyly and shove the tip of my sword into his knee. He screams in pure agony and tries reaching for his knee, but my foot on his chest holds him firmly in place. \"Wrong answer friend, next I cut off your fingers one by one.\" He screams in desperation, his words slurred by too much drink \"I ALREADY TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW ANYTHNG!\" With one quick slash three of his fingers are detached from his hand. He clutches the hand, clearly faint from the amount of pain being inflicted. \"I'll ask one more time\" As I drive my sword through his lower abdomen, he begins spitting up blood. \"Tell me what you know\" I say calmly as I sense the fear of The Smiling Men being over ran by the pain of torture. \"Okay okay okay..\" he says chokingly through the blood dribbling out of his mouth. He tells me everything I need to know. \"Please.. I gave you what you want.. end my suffering..\" I give him one last look of disgust before I slit his throat. I wander off to find Aldo.\n\n\tThe sun is shining as I make my way back to the pub, somehow the condemnable buildings look less ominous in the light. As I walk through the door, I find Aldo enjoying breakfast, he looks up and catches sight of me. He waves me over, through words, muffled by food,  he yells \"Ornell! Come enjoy some ale!\" I smile as I take my seat. A breakfast consisting of eggs, chicken, and potatoes. \"So, I followed the lead. He told me there are rumors of Oudin attacking a merchants wagon in the east\" I say as I shovel eggs into my mouth. \"Well, we have a destination now don't we.\" He says matter of factly after taking a swig of ale. I chuckle and look down at the table, the mornings events racing through my mind. \"So, when do we dep-\" His words are cut short as a large man starts yelling at the innkeep. \"4 coins for this piss drink?!\" He screams, spit flying out in the process. \"I'm.. I'm sorry sir, I do not control the prices.\" The innkeep says through chattering teeth. The man throws the cup at her head and laughs as the blow drops her to the ground. Aldo grunts as he quickly stands up and charges the man. He drives his shoulder into his chest and tries dragging him to the ground, but the man counteracts by throwing him into the bar. Aldo stands up and smiles, he waits patiently. As the man winds up to take a huge swing, Aldo quickly moves in and wraps around him, one hand on his bicep to prevent the strike, the other around the back of his neck. With full force he slams the mans face into the counter and blood spurts. He crumples to the ground, teeth laying around him, labored breathing through a broken jaw. \"Been too long since I've had a decent fight\" Aldo jeers as he makes his way around the counter. He picks the innkeep up off the ground and plants a kiss on her hand. \"I apologize for this brute fool my lady.\" I walk to the counter and place enough coins to cover the damage, the food, and the room for our stay. \"Come, Aldo, let us be on our way.\" \n\n\t\"Did you see the look of despair on his face right before I slammed him!\" Aldo says, laughter ringing through the trees. I laugh along with him. \"He almost shit himself for certain.\" \"So, have you thought of what your plan might be once we reach the end of our journey?\" Aldo asks curiously. \"No, not yet, maybe I'll head over to Dawsbury and see if any nobles have need of my services, what about you? What were you doing back there at the pub?\" \"Ah, looking for fights!\" We both chuckle as we continue along the dirt road. \"You know, Ornell, it's been quite a while since we have crossed swords.\" \"Indeed it has\" I let out with a long sigh. Aldo perks up and with a sly look asks \"Would you care to cross swords now, and see who of us is the better warrior?\" Not one to back away from a challenge I agree. We both draw our swords, his clearly has the reach advantage being a few feet longer than mine. He slowly circles around my sword arm, and I lunge, he jumps to the side and swings his sword around in a long arcing blow. I block and strike him in the face with my elbow while his guard is down. He falls to the ground and I pounce, I jump on top of him and move my sword towards his throat, before it gets there he rolls out from under me and grabs up his sword. \"Not a bad shot!\" He says with a bloody smile. He runs at me and brings his greatsword down with a hard blow, I side step and swing my sword at his leg, he lifts his leg just in time to dodge the swing, I follow up with another aimed at his chest. He dodges back, and I quickly run forward and kick him in his chest while he is off balance. He rolls when he hits the ground to quickly be back on his feet. I hold my sword with both hands and swing full force at his shoulder, he uses the momentum against me and disarms me with one quick parry. He swings over and over as I am dodging every blow, he swings too wildly on one attempt and I quickly take advantage of it and grab up my sword. Again he swings and I spin around, place my leg behind his, and knock him to the ground with my shoulder, I quickly put my sword to his chest. \"Yield!\" He says, I laugh and help him up. \"Ahh, Ornell, the years have done nothing to diminish your skill I see.\" I give a sarcastic chuckle and reply with \"I wish I could say the same to you\" We both laugh and continue on our way.\n\n\tWe decided to make camp in a small forrest clearing, as I lay there wishing to be taken by sleeps sweet embrace I am troubled by visions of my past.. I struggle to repress them back into the deep fabrics of my mind. This.. This can't be real, I thought as I slowly push open the charred door, the smell of burnt wood and flesh fill my nostrils. I look around, desperately praying that this was all a horrible dream. I stand there in shock as every worry I had is realized. I immediately burst into tears and utter anguish as I rush to the site of the burnt body that used to be my wife, I drop to my knees, and clutch at my head as if I was going to rip my face off. I can't believe this is happening. I turn her over, and immediately throw up. No.. no.. no no no NO GOD NO!!! My son! He was my world! IS MY WORLD! She must have been trying to protect him from the fire. This CANNOT BE HAPPENING! WHY! I slump back into the floor, I grab- \"Ornell, Ornell!\" I awake to Aldo leaning over me, shaking me. \"What are you doing Aldo?\" \"You were talking in your sleep, yelling no and rolling around..\" I sit up, drenched in sweat, \"Just.. a bad dream..\" If only it were just a dream.. I gulped back tears as I tried hard to forget the past.\n\n\n\tAldo and I quietly sneak along a hill covered in trees. We have reaced the hideout of The Smiling Men. We duck behind a rather large tree and listen as we hear random chatter. \"I can't believe that fool, Ornell actually believes we took his brother.. HA!\" what is he talking about? I think to myself. I quickly move along until I spot Oudin's tent. This place should be guarded.. Where is everyone.. Aldo draws his sword and walks out into the clearing. \"Aldo, what are you doing, get back here\" I whisper quietly. He gestures me over, I quickly draw my sword and follow. I look towards Oudin's tent.. Suddenly I feel my leg buckle and I'm down on one knee. Blinding pain shoots up my right leg. I drop my sword and grab onto my leg with both hands. I turn around to see Aldo's bloody sword and smug grin. \"Once a fool, always a fool Ornell.\" He laughs in that smug way he does. Suddenly, the tent flaps start moving, and out emerges a figure.. \"Brother?! Is that you? What is going on here, why are you walking free?\" He smiles and walks over to me, sword in hand. \"You fool, I am Oudin.\" He quickly drives his sword deep into my chest, I feel the cold bite of steel as every inch of metal penetrated my body. My consciousness starts to slip as I look up, dumbfounded. Oudin kneels down and stares deep into my eyes. \"I want to make sure betrayal is the last thing you see as you die, Ornell.\" I stare into his eyes.. I see him stand up, and prepare for a swing.. He swung his swo-\n\nThe end\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "passage": "[RF] Untitled\n\n\nAlan washed his pale face under cold crispy water that flowed out of the dingy bathroom sink. The bathroom smelled of sweet lavender and cigarettes. While not a pleasant combination this scent is the only scent Alan knew and and the only scent he ever wanted to know.\nAlan grabbed a towel that was hanging from the dusty towel holder and dried off his face. He then grabbed his wedding ring from the bathroom counter and slipped it on his finger. Alan glanced in the mirror as he was just about to walk out of the bathroom. The quick glance lured him in and Alan found himself standing in front of the mirror studying his reflection.\nIt was obvious he needed sleep. The dark purple circles under his eyes gave him an unforgettable look of sickness matched with his pale complexion. His soft blue eyes seemed to fade into the rest of his face only becoming noticeable when they were bloodshot from crying. The dark brown curls that sat neatly on top of his head gave him a boyish look. Instead of 25 he looked 18. According to his wife, every attempt at growing facial hair to try to enhance his age was pity and only made him look homeless and dirty. The desire to please her was the only thing that had not been replaced with the sadness that she left behind so he was freshly shaven every day in hopes of her return.\nAfter studying the man Alan no longer knew in the mirror he slowly slumped out of the bathroom into his bedroom. The bedroom was quiet and dark. A quick flip of the night stand lamp switch illuminated the room with a dark glow. Alan unhurriedly and thoughtfully walked around the room so careful as not to touch a single item. He wanted to preserve the room as it always has been. A messy yet organized room that could only be created by one person, but never recreated by another.\nAlan slipped off his clothes in the usual spot that he always did and neatly put them into a laundry hamper he had just bought. As he made his way to the bed he switched off the light, careful not to bump anything on his way.\nThe bed smelled of fresh lavender. As Alan laid on his back to start the nightly routine of staring at the blank ceiling for hours he could feel the scent creeping its way into his lungs and eventually into his memories ever so easily. Nothing got to Alan more than this scent. As he laid in bed the flow of tears silently trickled down the sides of his burning cheeks and onto the white satin pillow. These eerie reminders of everything he once had always sent a flood of emotions through his fragile body.\nAs hours went by Alan gave up on waiting for the apartment door to open bringing in what once was the meaning of his life and now was the cause of his pain; he turned over and went to sleep.\n\tAs the birds sang their morning songs outside the window the next morning little light was shed into the apartment through the tightly closed blinds. Alan turned over and looked at the clock facing towards him on the night stand. It read 9:37 a.m. This was too early to be awake. Especially since Alan’s days now only consisted of waiting.\n\tAlan got on his feet and quietly made his way to the shower as if not to disturb anyone in their sleep, a habit since he was always the first to be awake. Alan turned on the shower, took off his wedding ring which he set on the counter, and hopped in.\n\tThe water felt cold and rigid running down Alan’s spine sending false feelings of refreshment through his body. After half an hour of standing silently in the shower letting the water turn his entirety into a weak and cold figure Alan decided it was time to wash his hair. He grabbed the light purple bottle of lavender shampoo and squeezed a small sized amount onto the palm of his hand, barely enough to wash his full head of hair. It was the last of the shampoo. Disregarding the full bottle of men’s shampoo that sat right next to the empty bottle of lavender shampoo, he washed his hair quickly and stepped out onto the cold tile. The empty bottle of shampoo meant that Alan had to make the rare occasion of leaving his apartment to go to the store.\n\tAlan got dressed carefully making sure not to disturb anything in his path while looking through dirty clothes, searching for an outfit that could pass as clean. He needed to do laundry.\n\tAfter a long search for a “clean” outfit Alan settled for jeans and an old t-shirt.\n\tPacing back and forth he did not know whether or not the trip to the store was worth the risk of leaving his apartment. Alan found himself becoming anxious when he left his lonely sanctuary, worrying that at any moment his wife would return and Alan would miss his chance to see her again.\n\tExcept this time Alan knew he had to go. He ran out of coffee two days ago and even though Alan didn’t have an appetite anymore he knew he needed to buy some food. Most importantly, Alan did not want the smell of the sweet, sweet lavender that he loved so dearly to fade from the apartment and escape his lungs. For that smell of lavender was the only thing Alan had left.\n\tFinally, after a long moment of debating himself Alan grabbed his wallet and started his short walk to the grocery store at the corner of the block. Before he left, however, Alan made sure to leave the door unlocked and cracked open just an inch to give his wife an inviting message, in case of her return. Alan wanted her to know he wasn’t mad about her leaving and that she could come back home where he needed her at any time.\n\tIn the store Alan picked up the few essentials he thought he needed to last him a couple of weeks so that he would not have to venture out again for a while. Canned soup, bread, coffee, toilet paper and lavender shampoo filled the bottom of his cart as he walked up to the cash register to pay. A quick swipe of his credit card and Alan was on his way back home.\n\tAs Alan approached the door to his apartment he noticed that it was now open a lot more than just an inch. His heart began to beat fast as he made quick steps towards his door. Excitement and adrenaline started to replace any sadness and anxiety that was once there. Alan flung open the door. Practically throwing the bags of goods he had just purchased at the store Alan looked around the room wildly. The living room was empty. Alan could feel the familiar burning of his cheeks approach as he ran to the kitchen only to find a room full of emptyness. As anger and disappointment was slowly rising inside of Alan he ran to the door of his bedroom. Before he opened the door Alan took a deep breath and squinted back the tears that were fighting to be set free. He opened the door to find his usual company named Loneliness attempting to eat away at everything in the room. Loneliness had a history of leaving nothing left, not even an ounce of hope.\n\tOut of a fit of rage Alan headed back towards the living room and punched the bare white wall. After a couple seconds of pure anger he collapsed on the floor and laid there absorbing all of the small details around him. The door gently swayed from the wind out in the hallway as Alan had realized that he had sent himself on an emotional roller coaster ride for nothing. \n\tAs the door continued to sway gently back and forth, back and forth through the day and night, Alan let himself eventually fall asleep on the floor of his living room making no noise but an occasional whimper of sorrow.\n\tThe next morning Alan woke to an uncomfortable feeling. The feeling of being watched. As he turned over on his stomach the light felt warm on his heavy body that was sprawled out on the wooden floor. Alan peered through the shining light looking for the entity that made him feel watched, knowing just what he would find.\n\tSitting across from Alan on the reclining chair was Loneliness. Alan looked Loneliness dead in the sinister eyes. Loneliness did not just consist of loneliness, Loneliness consisted of anxiety, depression, fear and hate. This had not been the first time Loneliness had overstayed his welcome.\n\tAs the two stared at each other with blank expressions Alan felt as if he was sinking deeper and deeper into the ground. A whole day went on with Alan not eating, crying, moving, or thinking. The two just existed with no purpose or meaning attached to their existence. As hours passed and the night grew longer. Alan decided it was finally time to give in.\n\tAlan slowly picked his stiff body up off of the floor. Paying no attention to Loneliness who had already consumed half of the living room he made his way to the kitchen. On the counter sat the phone that hadn’t been used in weeks, waiting for a phone call that would never go through. Alan picked up the now unfamiliar device in his hand and dialed.\n\t“Nancy, I’m sorry. I know you’re probably sleeping... Yes, it’s happening again. I’m sorry. Yes… I’m sorry. Okay, I’ll be here. Goodbye.”\n\tAlan took a seat on the kitchen floor and began to cry. His shoulders heaved up and down as he began to scream through the short gasps of breath that were barely escaping his dry lips. Alan’s realization of the situation began to set in as his neighbors called the cops due to the shrilling screams dancing down the apartment hallway making their routinely appearance.\n\tAlthough Alan was repeatedly told to let go he couldn’t. He repeatedly held onto the hope that always transformed itself into the monster that lead him to his insanity.\n\tThe door shot open as Nancy came in to see Alan in his state of weakness.\n\t“Get up Alan.” She stated as she gently coaxed him into a chair.\n\t“How long have you been like this?” Nancy looked around the house. It looked the same as it usually did when she came over. Alan was back to his old antics.\n\t“I don’t know. I thought she was coming back. I’m sorry. I just thought she was coming back.” Alan whispered as he buried his head into his lap.\n\tIt pained Nancy to see Alan this way. Ever since her sister had died Alan had had these occasional episodes of whatever it was that made him think her sister would return. No one was hurt by the loss more than Alan was. He had always said his love for her was undying. But he had taken that expression too seriously, she thought, as she looked down at the man who she no longer recognized.\n\t“Let’s go, Alan. Grab your things and we’ll go see Dr. Hoffman. She has been waiting for a visit from you. I called her. Let’s go.” She grabbed her bag and waited for Alan to get up. Without a single care for grabbing his belongings he walked to the door awaiting Nancy to follow.\n\n\tThree weeks later Alan opened the door to the apartment; returning from the mental institution. Not to his surprise the apartment was cleaned up, everything was not in its usual place. The apartment no longer smelled of lavender and cigarettes, instead it was replaced with the strong smell of bleach. Nancy always cleaned up the apartment when Alan was away. She didn’t think it was healthy for him to live in an environment that he tried so hard to preserve.\n\tAlan set down his belongings that he got from the mental institution at the foot of the door and started the interminable process of setting everything back just the way his wife had left it before she died. Undoing all of the hard work that Nancy did Alan carefully wandered around the apartment moving things to match the pictures that were engraved in his mind of what it used to look like when she was alive.\n\tAfter everything was back in its usual place Alan sprayed the last of his wife’s lavender perfume around the rooms. He inhaled the smell as if getting a high off the memories the scent brought to him.\n\tIn his bedroom Alan laid on the left side of the bed. The right side was reserved for his wife. As Alan fiddled with the ring on his middle finger he began to doze off to sleep. While sleeping Alan heard the front door of his apartment creek open and shut quietly.\nSoft familiar footsteps made their way to Alan’s bedroom and opened the door. Alan didn’t have to open his eyes, he knew who it was. As she got into the bed in her self proclaimed spot Alan felt like he could finally breathe again. A flood of relief made Alan’s body almost tingle as he turned on his side, careful not to open his eyes. “I’ve missed you,” he said as he dozed back off to sleep to the sweet smell of lavender and cigarettes.",

    "passage": "Chapter 31\nLEX\n\nLex’s punches flew fast, but the Valkyrie caught each deftly with her shield.  The sheer force of Lex’s blows knocked her adversary back a step.  Lex seized the opening and dove forward into her sparring opponent in a burst of flame.\n\n“Ouch!” exclaimed Brynn, rubbing her cheek.  “What the hell, Lex?”  Hell, eh?  Brynn was clearly an ‘adult,’ according to whatever bullshit definition the jester lady used.  The Valkyrie’s skin was slightly singed, but no serious damage, luckily.  Lex wasn’t supposed to use fire in their training — particularly not against an unsuspecting opponent.\n\n“Uh, sorry,” said Lex.  “I…didn’t mean to.  I just…argh…this – this – this woman!!  What’s her PROBLEM?!”\n\nThe Lady of Hyperion raised an eyebrow.\n\nLex continued.  “Flashfucker, or whatever her name is.”\n\nLex knew it was Flashfire.  She often said “Flashfire” during her dashes.  Well, those times were clearly over.\n\nBrynn looked slightly amused, but still more pissed than amused.\n\n“What about her?  And can you have a modicum of self-control?”\n\nNo, obviously not, thought Lex.  If you want that, Vonn’s in his room.  Brooding.\n\n“She…”  Lex paused.  “She says we can’t go into the back garden anymore.  …and she’s a total bitch!”\n\n“Lex,” said Brynn with a sigh.  “You’re going to need to learn to control your temper.  Not just for me, or the other people here, or even common decency.  If it’s a weakness, your enemies will use it against you.”\n\nIt’s a strength, too! thought Lex.  Lex looked angry.  She felt angry.  The fire welled up inside her again, and-\n\n“LEX!”  Brynn’s voice snapped her out of it.  She’d never heard Brynn raise her voice that loud.  Lex felt that burning rush of shame rising from her gut into her cheeks, and she bent her head, subduing herself demurely.\n\nThe Valkyrie went on.  “For all we know there could be a WAR coming, and I’ll not have you getting yourself killed, or worse, getting someone else killed, because you can’t keep it together when someone does something you don’t like!”\n\nA war?!  That was news.  With whom?, Lex wanted to ask, but she was busy being lectured and, given the look on Brynn’s face, decided it was prudent to keep her mouth shut.  Hadn’t there just BEEN a war with those shadow people or whatever they were?  Right before she and Vonn were woken up.  Of course she had missed out on the fun.\n\nBrynn paused for a moment, perhaps thinking she’d said too much.  She shrugged.  “Now, Miss FLASHFIRE is a cybersecurity expert that Meridian brought on to secure this facility, and she has suggested REASONABLE precautions.”\n\nIf there was any threat of war, it admittedly made a lot more sense.  But why’d that stupid woman have to be such a bitch?\n\n“She wasn’t very nice,” mumbled Lex, after a moment.\n\n“What?” asked Brynn.\n\nLex prudently changed tack.  “Uh, she said she was in charge,” said Lex.  “Is that true?”\n\nBrynn cocked her head sideways.  “In charge of security, sure.”\n\nOh.  So Lady Brynn was still in charge of everything else?  Lex felt stupid.\n\n“Um, okay, good,” said Lex, feeling the color rise in her face.  “I…I’m sorry about the fire.  Can I…help?”  What was she going to do, rub aloe on the Valkyrie?  Didn’t make for the worst mental image, admittedly…\n\nBrynn frowned and shook her head.  “Just work on controlling your temper.  It’s very powerful, Lex, but YOU must master IT, and not vice versa.”\n\nWhere did Brynn get off sounding so wise?  Maybe Meridian was rubbing off on her?  Or maybe the Valkyrie was a lot smarter than she let on.\n\nLex bit her lip and nodded.  “Yes, ma’am.”\n\n“Oh, and you have an appointment with Miss Flashfire tomorrow morning to have your cybernetic enhancements examined.  See that you’re on your best behavior.  And after that, there’s a good chance we’ll be heading to Atlas.”\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nChapter 32\nVULCAN\n\nIt turned out not to be a fire at all, but rather, steam.  Grey and Sebastian arrived to a room clouded with steam (invisible) and smoke (visible) — or perhaps condensation of the steam.  The young man — Othin — was standing on a chair, struggling to disconnect the smoke alarm, and his uncle Watt was standing nearby berating him.  Over in the corner was a strange, almost animal-like machine with claws, seemingly the source of the steam.\n\n“He got scared,” Othin was saying defensively.  “Of course he released some steam.”\n\n“You made it SENTIENT?” shouted Watt.  “Why in GAIA’s name…?!”\n\n“Sorry, Uncle.  Uh, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  Why not give it the extra processing power to be able to do solo missions?”  He lowered his voice.  “Also, Huginn needed a friend.”\n\nWatt looked at a loss for words.  His face was red, and steam seemed to be coming out of his ears, but that was really just steam in the room.\nGrey cleared her throat.\n\n“Ah!  Miss Grey.  Um.  Everything is under control.  I’m so sorry about the disturbance,” said Watt.  He followed Grey’s eyes over to the machine.  “Oh, this is that project my nephew and I were working on, the tunneler for the Depths. Apparently, er, my nephew thought it should be a real badger.”\n\nGrey’s poker-faced expression (aided by her visor) betrayed absolutely no reaction, but Sebastian leapt in.\n\n“More animals are always welcome, but someone has to take care of …him?”\nOthin nodded at the pronoun.  Watt looked stunned that Sebastian would speak before Miss Grey, but the heiress didn’t seem to mind (though who could tell behind that visor?).  Well, Sebastian was in some ways a PR person for Hawk Aviation so it stood to reason that he had some decision-making authority.  Or was he volunteering?\n\n“You can’t be on missions with Huginn and still look after it…him…” said Watt, looking at his nephew.  The stout man looked over at Sebastian, thinking a moment, then sighed.  “I’ll do it.  My project, after all.  He’ll need a name.”\nGrey and Sebastian gave expressions suggesting “don’t look at us.”\n\n“Muninn,” said Othin.  “Then he can be Huginn’s friend.”\n\n“You’re naming it…what’s that translate to…Mind?!”\n\n“Well, he is sentient now.”\n\nThe machine stumbled out of the corner and looked up at the four humans.  It was actually adorable, with a badger-like snout and giant digging claws.\n\n“Muninn should be a bird, like Huginn,” said Sebastian.  “This boy’s a digger.  Something earthen, with steam and claws.  A new facet of Hawk Aviation.”\n\nSuddenly, to everyone’s shock, the machine opened its snout and said its first words.  Its voice was deep and gravelly.\n\n“Hello everyone.”\n\nWatt looked like he was about to have a heart attack.\n\n“It can talk?!”\n\n“I maaaaay have done a few more modifications than I mentioned,” said Othin sheepishly.\n\nWatt continued to look completely stunned.  Finally, he regained his composure.\n\n“My talented nephew, everyone.”\n\nNo one clapped.\n\n“So — perhaps the creature should name itself?” said Sebastian.\n\n“Him,” corrected Othin.\n\nThe creature cleared its throat.  “Her,” it corrected in its deep bass.\nOthin looked thunderstruck.  Admittedly, the creature was not anatomically correct, as it were, so it was somewhat free to choose its own gender identity — not that it wouldn’t have been free to do so anyway…just…\n\n“I’m still downloading a lot of information about the world,” said the creature.  “So, I don’t have a sense of what a good name would be.”\n\n“Perhaps we could stick with the mythological theme?” offered Sebastian.  “Hestia, perhaps?”\n\nThe creature shook her head.\n\n“Freyja?” asked Othin.\n\nAgain, no.  A jet of steam shot out from its nostril.\n\nWatt threw up his hands.  “How about Volcano?”\n\nThe creature’s ears perked up.\n\n“Vulcana,” said Othin.\n\n“Vulcan,” said Vulcan.\n\nGrey finally spoke for the first time.  “Sebastian, discuss animal caretaking procedure with Watt, and perhaps remind Othin as well.  I look forward to Vulcan joining us on a mission to the Depths soon.  I think there are some puzzle pieces still to be found down there.”\n\nShe was referring, presumably, to her quest to avenge the events that had transpired down there so long ago, and take down Magnus Pretorius.  But of the others in the room, only Sebastian had an inkling of this latter goal.  And — close as he and Grey had become, she had spoken only little of it.  It seemed too painful.  No doubt the poor girl must have PTSD, thought Sebastian.\n\nHe escorted Watt and Othin from the room, Vulcan in tow.\n\nThey didn’t know it then, but Vulcan’s first “mission,” of sorts, would be of a very different nature.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n",

    "passage": "1983 America's Cup\n\nThe 1983 America's Cup was the occasion of the first winning challenge to the New York Yacht Club, which had successfully defended the cup over a period of 132 years. An Australian syndicate representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club fielded the _Australia II_, skippered by John Bertrand, against defender _Liberty_, skippered by Dennis Conner. _Australia II_ won the match races after fighting back from a 3–1 deficit to win the America's Cup, ending the longest winning streak in sporting history and ending U.S. domination of the racing series.\n\n\nThe defender: _Liberty_\n\nSkippered by team principal Dennis Conner, _Liberty_ won all the Defender trials and on 2 September 1983, the New York Yacht Club confirmed that _Liberty_ was to represent the NYYC as defender of the America's Cup.[1]\n\nDuring the summer preceding the trials, Conner had been the focus of extensive media attention in the U.S. He was even featured on the cover of _Sports Illustrated_ magazine, a rare recognition for a sailor.\n\nThe crew included Connor as skipper, Tom Whidden, navigator Halsey Chase Herreshoff, Scott Vogel, and mainsheet trimmer John Marshall.\n\nLiberty had competed with John Kolius' _Courageous_ and Tom Blackaller's _Defender_ in a defender series before being selected by the New York Yacht Club.[2] Gary Jobson was the founder and tactician of the Courageous/Defender syndicate.[3]\n\n\nThe challenger: _Australia II_\n\nAlan Bond arrived at Newport with _Australia II_, billed as one of the biggest threats to American dominance of the 12 Metre class. The boat was designed by Ben Lexcen and skippered by John Bertrand. The revolutionary “winged keel” of the Australian yacht was a subject of controversy from the outset of the challenger series, with the New York Yacht club alleging that the winged keel boat was not a legal 12 Meter, and that the keel design itself was the result of Dutch engineers, and not by Lexcen. This second point would have made _Australia II_ illegal under the requirement that the boat be “designed and constructed in country” as the Deed of Gift that governed the competition stipulated.[4] The boat was ruled a legal 12 Meter, and she was allowed to participate in the regatta. The speed of the new contender, along with the controversy and protests intensified international media attention to the series.\n\n_Australia II_ dominated the challenger series and entered the America's Cup finals as the most promising contender to date.\n\n\nThe races\n\nThe U.S. yacht won the first and second races by margins of more than a minute when the Australian yacht suffered equipment failure, but the _Australia II_ took the third race, and came back to win the fifth and sixth races after _Liberty_ won the fourth. This was the first time the America's Cup had needed a sixth race, let alone a seventh.[5]\n\n  Date                Winner           Yacht   Loser            Yacht   Score   Delta\n  ------------------- ---------------- ------- ---------------- ------- ------- -------\n  14 September 1983   _Liberty_        US-40   _Australia II_   KA-6    0-1     1:10\n  15 September 1983   _Liberty_        US-40   _Australia II_   KA-6    0-2     1:33\n  18 September 1983   _Australia II_   KA-6    _Liberty_        US-40   1-2     3:14\n  20 September 1983   _Liberty_        US-40   _Australia II_   KA-6    1-3     0:43\n  21 September 1983   _Australia II_   KA-6    _Liberty_        US-40   2-3     1:47\n  22 September 1983   _Australia II_   KA-6    _Liberty_        US-40   3-3     3:25\n  26 September 1983   _Australia II_   KA-6    _Liberty_        US-40   4-3     0:41\n\nThe cup title came down to the seventh and final race. For the seventh and deciding race on 26 September 1983 the wind was light at around eight knots. The pre-start was not a typical match race start. “Neither party wanted to make a mistake and end up in the protest room,” Conner would explain later.[6] _Liberty_ won the start by eight seconds ahead of _Australia II_ on paper but the Australians held a controlling position at the favoured end sailing toward the favoured side which gave them the early lead. _Australia II_ was subsequently overtaken by Conner who built up what seemed to be an unassailable margin. At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the America's Cup looked like it would stay in Newport. Conner failed to cover _Australia II_ which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing _Australia II_ to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark. Conner then engaged _Australia II_ in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks including a number of faked “dummy” tacks trying to break the Australians' cover. _Australia II_ held on until both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of _Liberty_ and sailed to the finish to take the race. _Australia II_ crossed the finish line with a winning margin of 41 seconds, becoming the first successful challenger in the 132 years “since the schooner _America_ won it in a race around England's Isle of Wight in 1851”.[7]\n\n\nAftermath\n\nThe final race was televised in Australia in the early hours of 27 September 1983 (Australian time) just before dawn, and the victory was celebrated in public venues across Australia. Prime Minister Bob Hawke was interviewed at the dawn celebration in Claremont, Western Australia. After humorously fending off repeated questioning by journalists about whether he would declare a public holiday he admitted this was a state matter and outside his power as Prime Minister. He joked that he thought it should be and that any state Premiers who disagreed with him might “find themselves in a spot of bother”. To rapturous laughter and applause he said with finality “Any boss who sacks a worker for not turning up today is a bum”.[8]\n\nThe loss of the 1983 America's Cup was considered a time of shame in U.S. sailing, as the U.S. had been able to defend the Cup for 132 years. Dennis Conner took the loss hard. Asked about how he felt initially after losing the Cup Conner said: “It was awful. I just did not want to get out of bed in the morning. I am usually full of life and energy... I just wanted to hide”.[9]\n\nThe America's Cup was transferred from the New York Yacht Club to the Royal Perth Yacht Club located in Perth, Western Australia, which subsequently hosted its first, but unsuccessful, defense in the 1987 America's Cup. After losing the Cup the U.S. had been determined to bring it back. Conner went to work on the next US America's Cup Campaign. With the help of designers Britton Chance, Jr., Bruce Nelson and David Pedrick, the boat _Stars and Stripes 87_ was created which, after progressively gaining speed in a grueling challenger series, became the 1987 challenger. Stars and Stripes sailed against Kookaburra, the Australian defender, with Conner winning the 1987 America's Cup and returning it to the U.S.[10] The 1992 film _Wind_ portrays in large part the loss of the 1983 Cup and the journey to regain it at the 1987 Challenge. While parts of the film take some creative license with the actual events, _Wind_ has generally been acclaimed as the single most accurate and realistic sailing film ever made, capturing not only the technical and physical challenges of sailing, but also the realistic and daily culture and lifestyle of professional yachtsmen and yachtswomen.[11]\n\nIn retrospect, Conner said that losing the Cup in 1983 had been good for the sport of sailing and the Cup itself: “Me losing after 132 years was the best thing that ever happened to the America's Cup and the best thing that ever happened to Dennis Conner...Before the win by the Australians, the America's Cup was only big in the minds of the yachties, but the rest of the world didn't know or care about it at all. But when we lost it... it was a little bit like losing the Panama Canal - suddenly everyone appreciated it. If I hadn't lost it, there never would have been the national effort... without that there never would have been the ticker-tape parade up Fifth Avenue in New York, lunch with the President at the White House and all the doors of opportunity that it opened”.[12]\n\n[1] [http://www.americascup.com/en/acclopaedia/circlinggalaxy/bateau.php?idIndex=&idContent=4883 Liberty - US 40] _America's Cup 32nd Official Site_\n\n[2] Bertrand, John _Born to win : a lifelong struggle to capture the America's Cup_ (as told to Patrick Robinson).

    "passage": "New Jersey is in the crosshairs of a major winter storm that could paralyze parts of New England and dump in excess of a foot of snow on the Garden State by Saturday. The forecast remains highly volatile and may change dramatically in the coming 24 hours.\n\nThroughout the day, The Star-Ledger will provide updates here (newest on top) as new information comes in, watches and warnings are issued and the forecast changes.\n\n10:30 P.M. Weather forecasters tonight reiterated warnings for drivers and residents that a potentially dangerous portion of the storm will be hitting much of central and northern New Jersey during Friday's evening rush-hour. Major travel delays are expected late Friday and Friday night as rain turns into snow, the National Weather Service forecast said.\n\nMORE SNOWSTORM UPDATES\n\n• Friday, Feb. 8: N.J. snowstorm: Live updates on blizzard, traffic, flooding and more\n\n• Saturday, Feb. 9: N.J. snowstorm update: Power outages, snow totals and other storm news\n\nAfter periods of rain, heavy snow is expected to be falling in many places by late Friday afternoon , the forecast said. In some places north of Interstate 78, snow is expected to come down between 1 and 2 inches per hour. In counties like Sussex, Morris and Warren, expected snow accumulations range from 6 to 16 inches.\n\nFor many towns from Jackson in Ocean County to Somerville in Somerset County and out east to Long Beach Island, snow accumulation is expected to range from 4 to 10 inches. High winds are expected throughout the region, topping out in Monmouth County, with gusts up to 45 mph possible.\n\nBy daybreak Saturday, flurries will taper off, giving way to a sunny, blustery day, the latest forecast said.\n\n9:12 P.M. With forecasters still predicting a major winter storm to hit New Jersey, many schools throughout the state are preemptively canceling or delaying classes Friday.\n\n8:45 P.M. In advance of the storm, NJ Transit has announced it will be offering full systemwide cross-honoring all day Friday and all day Saturday, enabling customers to use their ticket or pass on an alternate travel mode — rail, bus or light rail.\n\n5 P.M. The signatures of thunder-snow (which is just what it sounds like -- thunder and lightning during heavy snow) are showing up on several models, according to NY NJ PA Weather meteorologistSteven DiMartino.\n\nThis indicates the potential for extremely heavy snow to fall in eastern New Jersey tomorrow night, and adds to the unpredictability to totals.\n\n\"Where you get some of this convective snow, when it comes down, it's going to come down very, very hard,\" he said. \"It's difficult to pinpoint just where these bands are going to occur. You could end up with a situation where one town has 18 inches of snow and the next town over has three.\"\n\nDiMartino stressed the volatility that remains in the forecast, and urged state residents to pay close attention to changing conditions. Many of the details of what ultimately will happen in local areas will not be determined until the storm beings to come together tomorrow.\n\nHe said the potential for these heavier snow bands to develop may be why some forecast models (like the NAM, above), are predicting much heavier snowfall totals than the National Weather Service.\n\n[]\n\nThe North American Model (NAM), released this afternoon, showed well over a foot of snow falling over many areas in New Jersey.\n\n4:13 P.M. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for parts of northeastern New Jersey, including Newark and Jersey City, and the five boroughs of New York, where upwards of 14 inches of snow are expected along with howling winds and severely reduced visibility.\n\nThe blizzard warnings are in effect from 6 a.m. Friday until 1 p.m. Saturday and warn of 10 to 14 inches of snow, with locally higher amounts and white-out conditions with wind gusts of up to 45 miles per hour. Blizzard conditions are expected in coastal northeastern New Jersey, in southern Bergen and Passaic Counties and Eastern Hudson, Essex and Union counties.\n\nFurther north and west, 10 to 14 inches of snow are also expected, but winds are not expected to reach blizzard criteria. Winter storm warnings are in effect there.\n\n3:24 P.M. The National Weather Service at Mount Holly has issued Winter Storm warnings for several counties in northern and central New Jersey and extended further them further south than the areas the previously issued watches covered.\n\nThe winter storm warnings have been issued for Sussex, Warren, Morris, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and northwest Burlington counties. In Sussex, Warren and Morris counties, the National Weather Service is expecting between ten to 16 inches of snow to fall, while other counties in the warning areacould receive six to ten inches. The warnings are in effect from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\nExpect the National Weather Service's Upton, N.Y. office, which covers northeastern N.J., to follow suit shortly.\n\nFurther south, winter weather advisories have been issued for the rest of the state, where between two and five inches of snow is anticipated.\n\n3:07 P.M.The private and public sectors in New Jersey are now bracing for major storm impacts.\n\nMore than 350 United Airlines flights, many based out of Newark-Liberty International Airport, have already been canceled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. NJ Transit announced they will cross-honor tickets across its entire system. Utilities like Jersey Central Power & Light and PSE&G say they will have extra crews on hand to deal with potential power issues caused by heavy snow and wind.\n\nAdditionally, several events are being postponed across the state, such as two sectional high school track championships. The state Office of Emergency Management has not yet opened its operations center in Trenton, but it remains a possibility. Mary Goepfert, a spokeswoman for OEM, said the state is monitoring the storm closely and has been in contact with local emergency managers in preparation.\n\n2:07 P.M. The European model is in and it looks snowy, much like many of the other models that ran earlier. Were this to verify, a six to 12-inch plus snowfall is definitely in the cards for north and central New Jersey, particularly north of Interstate-195.\n\nFreehold-based meteorologist and owner of NY NJ PA Weather Steven DiMartino said he likes the European solution best, so far, and agrees with totals.\n\nWhat does the NAM look like, you ask? Well the snowfall printout is posted below, but Eric Holthaus tweeted a picture of the simulated radar produced by the NAM model for tomorrow night. An absolute monster.\n\n1:50 P.M. The most-affected regions of Hurricane Sandy along the New Jersey coast are about to take another hit. With defenses already weakened, coastal communities could see major impacts from coastal flooding, with the worst coming Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"I'm really worried about the areas worst hit by Sandy,\" said NWS meteorologist Gary Szatkowski. \"Time is starting to work against us...We could see substantial beach erosion. I know people have been working hard, but there's less to erode. We could easily see waves and water coming into areas you typically wouldn't.\"\n\nSzatkowski said he is concerned about the Raritan Bay shore in particular, where a three foot storm surge is possible at high tide Saturday morning, with five to seven foot waves breaking over top of it.\n\n1:22 P.M. Tomorrow night's commute could be awful in northern New Jersey. By 7 p.m., there is a threat that snowfall rates could reach two inches per hour across large swaths of northern and central New Jersey. Snowfall rates of this magnitude could reduce visibility substantially, wreak havoc on roads and make travel dangerous, if not nearly impossible.\n\nGary Szatkowski, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service's Mount Holly office, said he is going \"very worried\" about deteoriorating conditions in the afternoon, and posted a map on Twitter showing where the threat of intense snowfall will be at 7 p.m.\n\n12:34 P.M. An important thing to remember about this storm is the volatility in the forecast remains high, even though models have been trending snowier. State Climatologist David Robinson said the bust potential for this forecast is \"tremendous\" and the slightest shift in the forecast track could mean the difference between a major snowstorm, and a primarily rain event for much of the state.\n\nEric Holthaus, of the Wall Street Journal, points out that how much warm air enters region prior to storm will be crucial\n\n12:04 P.M. The National Weather Service at Mount Hollyand Upton, N.Y. both issued briefing packages on the coming storm this morning. Each warned that blizzard conditions may occur Friday night in northern New Jersey. Mount Holly suggested blizzard warnings may be necessary as the storm unfolds.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued during very specific situations by the National Weather Service. Anticipated winds of at least 35 miles per hour and visibility reduced below a quarter of a mile for a period of three hours is necessary before the agency pulls the trigger on such a warning. Travel would become all but impossible.\n\n11:53 A.M. David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University, said he does not envy forecasters today, calling this type of storm \"the most difficult forecast a New Jersey meteorologist will have to make.\" The forecast is complicated for a number of reasons, from New Jersey's geography to the thermal profile of the atmosphere. More on why New Jersey winter storms are so hard to pin down later.\n\n11:35 A.M. Forecast model guidance on the storm continues to vary but appears to be focusing in on a snowier solution for northern and central New Jersey. Overnight, several reliable models (The European, GFS and NAM) showed very different solutions to the storm, showing everything from minor event to a major winter storm that would have serious impacts on travel in northern sections of the state.\n\nThis morning, the GFS and NAM both showed the bulk of New Jersey north of I-195 receiving several inches of snow, perhaps exceeding a foot in some areas. The latest run of the European model, considered one of the most reliable, will be released at approximately 1:30 p.m.\n\n[]\n\nThe North American Model (NAM) shows an even snowier solution for New Jersey, with parts of the state easily exceeding a foot of snow.\n\nKeep in mind, each model run is just one of scores of pieces of data the National Weather Service uses to make forecasts and no single model should be viewed as a complete representation of what will happen.\n\n11:30 A.M. A winter storm watch remains in effectfor the vast majority of northern and central New Jersey. Current forecasts call for six to 12 inches of snow, with higher amounts possible in the northern most sections of New Jersey.\n\nBecause the storm is highly complex and much remains uncertain, particularly where the rain/snow line will fall, the National Weather Service is holding off on issuing any warnings until this afternoon.\n\n_The Associated Press contributed to this report._\n\nFollow @SStirling\n\nNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.\n",

    "passage": "In a shallow underwater cave off the southern coast of France, a team of scientists and conservationists discovered a stunningly pristine population of Mediterranean red coral.\n\n“I remember my first thought: ‘Man, I don’t think there’s anything so special in here,’” recalls Joaquim Garrabou, a marine ecologist with the Spanish Research Council and head of the research team. His colleague, Jean-Georges Harmelin, had discovered the site while surveying grouper populations in the Scandola Nature Reserve, off the coast of Corsica.\n\nGarrabou soon changed his tune, when the submerged cliffs of unassuming rock opened into a stunning sight: a cave over 3,000 square feet in area, full of the densest population of large red coral colonies ever discovered, let alone at such a shallow depth. The research team mumbled joyfully to each other through their regulators. The dome-like overhang put ecologist Silvija Kipson in mind of a past trip to the Sistine Chapel: “head constantly up, gazing in awe at a masterpiece crafted by nature.”\n\n“During my twenty-five years as a marine biologist, I’ve never seen something like this,” says Garrabou.\n\nIndividual red coral specimens, called colonies, spread vibrant crimson branches from the walls and ceiling of the overhang, their ghostly polyps waving in the current as they filter a meal of algae and zooplankton. Sponges cluster among the coral; a wide variety of fish species shimmer in the dim light.\n\n“For the first fifteen minutes, we were very focused, taking pictures and making measurements,” says Nuria Teixidó, another member of the research team, which was supported by the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas initiative. “But when we finished, we took a little time to ourselves, to observe, to leave the camera and really enjoy, really see…time stopped.” (See breathtaking photos of the Mediterranean from Your Shot photographers.)\n\nSee the Beautiful and Endangered Red Coral of the Mediterranean\n\nDivers explore a red coral population in Scandola Nature Reserve, only a short distance away from the Cave b site described in the team's study.\n\nThough the discovery was made in 2010, the team's study, published today in Scientific Reports, provides the first public glimpse into this unique site—and into the state of red coral throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nCalled Cave b, the place is “like a window to the past,” says Emma Cebrian, a marine ecologist and one of the study’s co-authors, imagining an era before human exploitation of coral.\n\nTo sustainably manage marine reserves, conservationists must understand what healthy, pristine ecosystems look like, in order to know how to shape strategies for recovering ecosystems. Cave b, with its mature coral population and thriving community of sponges, fish, zooplankton, and other marine life, paints them a clear target.\n\nMost coral populations in the Mediterranean harbor small, loosely gathered colonies—centuries of overexploitation prevent populations from recovering to full maturity. Prior to the discovery of Cave b, it was thought that larger colonies could only grow in deeper sites. Yet the size and health of Cave b at such a shallow depth contradict this thinking.\n\nThere, some colonies stretched to over a foot in length, the largest the team had ever seen in living specimens. Later analysis revealed that the Cave b population boasts one hundred times the biomass of the next largest population known.\n\n“It’s a museum full of treasure, but without doors and locks,” says Enric Sala, National Geographic explorer-in-residence and founder of the Pristine Seas project, who also co-authored the study.\n\nMotion detectors and laser grids may be absent, but this treasure is hardly unguarded: the Scandola Marine Reserve, where the cave was found, is a protected area and UNESCO world heritage site, often hailed as a global model of conservation management. Cave b is situated in a no-take zone, where all scuba diving, fishing, and other activities are strictly prohibited.\n\nOther sites have not been so lucky.\n\n\nA RED CORAL GOLD RUSH\n\nSince the Neolithic era, red coral has been harvested in droves, its skeleton—which, unlike other corals, is a brilliant red throughout, rather than sporting only a thin layer of reddish algae—polished and fashioned into prized jewelry. Considering the animal to be a potent charm, ancient Romans hung branches of coral around their children’s necks to protect them from danger. Kings and empires squabbled over control of key coral-harvesting sites, eager to benefit from a monopoly on trade of the precious ornaments, hauled up by the boatload. (Learn how archaeologists discovered 23 shipwrecks in 22 days.)\n\nIn the 20th century, the “St. Andrew’s cross” historically used to harvest coral—a heavy wooden cross with attached nets—was replaced by motorized vessels that dragged metal dredges through coral beds, devastating populations. While this practice was outlawed in 1994, it is still legal to harvest red coral by scuba diving.\n\n View Images\n\nA tube anemone inhabits a shallow Mediterranean cave. Caves were the last habitat where Mediterranean red coral survived industrial exploitation. Since the advent of scuba diving, even caves have been depleted. Photograph by Enric Sala\n\nAnd demand has only increased: the most valuable of the world's precious corals, _Corallium rubrum_ can today go for as much as $1,000 a gram, with Chinese consumers proving an especially eager market. In some cases, commercial interests have obstructed efforts to pass international legislation protecting populations from overharvesting.\n\n“The magnitude of loss of large red coral colonies due to overexploitation…is comparable to mass deforestation at a continental scale,” as in the Amazonian rainforest, the study finds. (See vibrant pictures of a surprising Amazonian coral reef.)\n\nAs an engineer species, red coral is the literal foundation of many Mediterranean ecosystems, shaping the physical environment and providing a habitat for fish and a variety of other marine life. But, the authors argue, its populations are now so decimated it is unable to fulfill that critical role, rendering it ecologically extinct.\n\n View Images\n\nRainbow wrasses are common in shallow Mediterranean waters. Red coral used to grow also on shallow walls and overhangs in the Mediterranean, before historical overexploitation.\n\nPhotograph by Enric Sala\n\nRed coral is long-lived and slow-growing: in the course of a year, the continents move over a hundred times farther than a single colony expands its diameter. \"A colony the size of your extended hand can be 300-400 years old,\" Sala pointed out. And while colonies damaged by fishing have a high capacity for survival and regrowth, age and resilience alone can’t shore up vulnerable populations against the tides of human exploitation—and of pollution, ocean acidification, and warming water.\n\nAs a relatively shallow sea, the Mediterranean is acutely affected by climate change, even in cooler areas where red coral is more abundant. “You only need to visit a coralligenous outcrop that is completely dead after a heat wave, when it was a hotspot of biodiversity and natural heritage only a few months ago,\" says Cebrian, in order to understand the impact of climate change on coral populations already weakened by overexploitation. (Read about why nature makes us happy.)\n\nHistorically overfished, heavily polluted, and host to hundreds of invasive species, the Mediterranean is \"a microcosm of what's happening in the global ocean,\" said Sala. \"Because of global environmental degradation, we face a serious problem of perception. What we believe is 'natural' is what we first saw as kids. Imagine what's natural for today's kids! Re-shifting our personal baselines is essential to make people care about conservation.\"\n\n\nTURNING THE TIDE?\n\nThe dazzling colonies discovered in Cave b are just that baseline, the scientists say: proof that it is still possible for Mediterranean red coral to exist in a pristine state. And although the road to ecological recovery may not be easy, and any positive effects will take decades to become apparent, this team believes it’s possible with public support and smart management.\n\n View Images\n\nThe Mediterranean dusky grouper, like the red coral, is an endangered species because of overexploitation. Its abundance recovers within marine reserves, like Scandola in Corsica.\n\nPhotograph by Enric Sala\n\nThe first step is to protect and preserve healthy populations, like that in Cave b, and use them as a model to expand protection to more debilitated areas. Research has even revealed coral genotypes that are more tolerant of temperature changes, which can be transplanted into more at-risk sites. However, this technique is a stop-gap—in the long term, it’s a matter of tightening harvesting regulations and establishing a network of protected areas throughout the Mediterranean in order to allow populations to reach maturity, the paper argues.\n\nDespite the daunting obstacles, some progress has been made, and further steps are being taken. The IUCN Red List notes that red coral is endangered, easing the passage of protective legislation at national and international levels. The Catalan government recently announced that a decade-long moratorium on fishing will be put in place by 2018. And some jewelry companies, recognizing the difficulty of sustainably sourcing coral, have even refused to carry coral products.\n\nFor marine ecologist and study co-author Cristina Linares, the discovery of Cave b’s astounding red coral population is a beacon of hope. “At this moment, for the first time, I am optimistic,” she said.\n\n_Follow Rachel on Instagram and Twitter._\n",

    "passage": "*Chicago* My first short story for a fiction class.\n\nThe clean, cold snow falls slowly on to the streets of Chicago.  The snow crunches loudly under William’s feet.  The sound echoes of the large buildings surrounding him, making it sound like a crowd of people all pulling Velcro apart.  His eyes dart back and forth, always on the lookout for danger.  His breath puffs out in front of him and begins to condense on his thin beard.  Two rabbits are hanging off his back, his pace is hurried, it will be the best dinner he has had in weeks.  The tall skyscrapers eventually give way to old neighborhoods.  A light blue two story appears in the distance and William’s face cracks the ghost of a smile.  As he nears he takes in the boarded windows that clash with the white trim running along the roof.\n“Home at last,” he whispers to himself.\nOnce inside he begins skinning the rabbits, one will be dinner and the other will be saved for later.  He is a small man with thinning light blonde hair.  He is days past his fortieth birthday, but the events of the last few months make him look closer to fifty.  His clothing is a mash up of whatever can be found.  A pair of faded jeans and a sweat shirt with Boston emblazoned on the front show their age.  The house sits on the North side of the city, a short walk from what used to be Wrigley Field.  A sturdy black pistol sits next him, reflecting light from the quiet fire.  William has barely survived these last six months and being a bit of a loner has not helped his situation.\n\tBlankets of all colors cover the walls in an attempt to keep what little heat inside the house.  Above the fireplace hangs a child’s blanket with a monkeys head on it.  Over across one of the windows hangs one with the Chicago Cubs logo splayed across it.  The red C clashing against the blue in the flickering light makes for a haunting reminder of days long gone.  He falls asleep in the chair, trying to keep warm on this cold Midwestern night.\n\tAh, not again, he thinks.  I can’t keep sleeping like this, I’m going to wake up one morning and not be able to stand.  William stands and stretches the kinks out of his body.  His shoulder pops, and he lets out a groan.  His body isn’t holding up like it used to.  One of the perks of getting old, he thinks.  He moves to the wall near the door and looks through a peephole out into the new day.  His tracks have been covered nicely by the fresh snow, and all seems quiet.  \n\tHe can hear the sounds of the gangs roaming the streets.  A patchwork of communities has sprung up throughout the city, some controlled by gangs, others free.  William has always stayed apart though, living like this even before the disaster that befell the world.  Many died in the first few weeks, mostly from hunger and fighting each other.  Suddenly a scream rings through the clear air, carried by wind that gave this city its nickname.  William hurries over and collects the pistol, checking the ammunition as he shuffles back to the peephole.  \n\tWhat could that be? The thought runs through his mind, as he waits tensely for the person attached to the scream to present themselves.  Suddenly, around one of the buildings on the next block, a figure comes streaking down the street being chased by a large man wearing the colors of one of the local gangs, bright yellow. He has a baseball bat and looks to be gaining on a small woman.  William can do one of two things; go back to his chair and stoke the fire back up, or intervene on behalf of the person being chased.  He usually keeps apart for a reason.  As they near, he can see now that the woman being chased is holding a baby.  That makes the choice easy.  William waits for them to near his home, and as they are running past he steps out and two shots ring out in the crisp morning air.  One bullet catches the large man in the shoulder, the other through the back of his neck. He dies instantly.  Deep red blood gushes from the wounds and stains the snow in a slowly spreading pool.  The snow retreats from the blood as if it poison.  Steam slowly rises from the body and young woman stares in horror at the sight.\n\tShe slowly sinks to her knees in shock.\n\t“Come on, get up.  Get inside while I take care of this body, someone will be along shortly to investigate the gunshot.”  William walks over and pulls the woman to her feet and nudges her towards the door. “You should get the baby in out of the cold.”\n\tThat snaps her out of it, and she glances down at the bundle in her arms and back up at William.  He smiles at her gently and gestures towards the door.  As she walks slowly towards the door, William begins his brutal work of moving the body into the park across the way and burying it in the snow for someone to find later.  He then grabs a shovel and starts throwing snow on top of the pile of blood.  When the street again looks white and clean, he heads back inside.  The woman is crouching by the fire with a look of apprehension in her pale blue eyes.  William slowly puts the gun down and away from her.  She has light brown hair that is cut short and is wearing baggy clothing that helps to conceal her form.  She has a thin face with a small nose and prominent cheekbones that make her look very striking.\nWilliam continues to stare intently at her.\n\t“I’m not going to hurt you, my name is William.  What’s yours?” William says, as he slowly gestures to himself.\n\t“My name is Linda.” She states quietly.\n\t“It’s nice to meet you Linda.  Would you like some food or water?” William asks with a gentle tone of voice.\n\t“No, thank you.”\n\t“Why was that thug chasing you?  The gangs don’t usually concern themselves with regular people very often; they are usually too busy fighting each other to worry about one woman and her baby.” William moves over to his chair and stares at her thoughtfully waiting for her answer.\n\t“This is Vincent Wilson’s baby….” Linda stares at the baby as she speaks the name of the leader of one of the gangs that controls the city. \n\t“Well, shit.” William stares at her in shock.  I can’t keep her here.  That will bring a whole army of goons down on us.  I need to figure out how to get her and the boy away from here.  Williams mind races with the beginning of a plan.\n\t“That is definitely a problem then.  You need to get away from the city.  As long as you remain here, you will be in danger.  Let’s get some food going and we can figure out what to do in the morning.  No one should be nosing around here for a few days.”  William starts pacing as he speaks.  “Can you protect yourself?”  His voice has on an edge to it and Linda shies away from him.\n\t“I just want to get out of the city with Michael,” Linda says as she clutches the baby a little tighter.\n\tWilliam rubs his face with his hands.\n“I’m sorry, I know this is happening fast, but you don’t have much time.  How do you expect a baby to survive in this new world if you don’t have any plan?  Let’s just button up for the day and night, and reassess the situation in the morning,” says Williams as he starts to gather blankets for an impromptu bed for Linda and baby Michael.  It has been six months since a massive solar flare knocked all of the electronics out throughout the entire world.  The government could not keep control and now the former United States is in anarchy.  \n\t“Thank you for helping me William,” Linda says as she walks over and squeezes William’s arm.\n\t“You’re welcome.”\n\tIn the middle of the night, William is awoken by movement off to his right, where Linda and Michael are sleeping.  He could see Linda’s figure get up and quietly make her way to the door and exit out into the icy night.  William gets up and checks on baby Michael, he is sleeping soundly, and then walks over to the peephole to check on Linda.  He sees a group of men outside with dyed blue rags tied around their arms, and Linda is in the middle of them pointing back towards the house.\n\tWhat the hell, thinks William as he runs over and grabs his pistol.  He checks the ammo, only six shots are left in it, and there are at least ten men outside.  He calls out to Linda, his voice ringing off of the buildings.\n\t“Linda! What is going on out there?” His voice sounds harsh as the reality of the situation slowly sets in.\n\t“I didn’t say I was Michael’s mother.  I stole him from Vincent so that I could get in with one of the rival gangs.  These gentlemen here have a vested interest in gaining an advantage over Vincent.”  A smile slowly spreads across her face as she regards William.  Though she is smiling, Linda’s eyes have become the cold and unforgiving eyes of a machine.  “It was no accident that I went by your place trying to escape.  You aren’t apart of any community, you live out here by yourself.  No one is going to miss you, and you make the perfect scapegoat for little Michael’s death.  These men are going to kill you and take Michael.  There isn’t anything that you can do to stop it from happening.”  There is a loud crack, and a red spot slowly spread across Linda’s chest.  Her smile wavered and she turned to regard the thug with the smoking gun standing behind her.  Her body topples into the snow like a doll discarded by a bored child.  All the men’s faces are hard, with scars and scowls giving them a menacing look, even though each face is different, they all have the same dead eyes and blank expressions.  They are more like robots than men.  \n\tWilliam shuts his eyes and looks back at baby Michael.  He walks over and regards him with sadness in his eyes.  Michael’s eyes open and stare at William with a wisdom that can only be found in the eyes of an infant.\n\t“I’m sorry I couldn’t do more to help Michael, but I don’t think I want to be here anymore after everything that has happened.  I can’t save you.”  William reaches down and strokes Michael’s soft cheek, and adds some more wood to the fire.  The orange flames lick at the new piece like a thirsty man who just spilled his water.\n\tWilliam walks over to the corner and slowly slides down to the floor.  The pistol is still clutched in his hand and the weight of it is somewhat reassuring.\n\t“I truly am sorry,” William says to the silence of the room.  For the first time in a long while, William is not alone.\n\tA gunshot echoes as the cold, harsh light of morning bathes the city in fire.   \n",

    "passage": "Gareth Griffiths (footballer)\n\nGARETH JOHN GRIFFITHS (born 10 April 1970) is an English former footballer. A defender, he played 337 league games in a 13-year career in the English Football League.\n\nStarting his career with Welsh club Rhyl, he made the move to the English professional game in 1993 with Port Vale. After around 100 games in five years for the club he transferred to Wigan Athletic in 1998. In another three years he moved on to Rochdale. A constant first team player at 'Dale, he made 184 league appearances in five years with the club. In 2006, he joined non-league Northwich Victoria, where he spent one season before retiring.\n\n\nPlaying career\n\nGriffiths started his career with Rhyl, before being bought by John Rudge, manager of Second Division club Port Vale, for £1,000 in February 1993.[1] He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Stockport County on 12 February 1994, though played little part in the 1993–94 promotion campaign, though found himself regularly appearing in the First Division from August 1994.[2] In November 1994 he developed a groin injury which required him to go in for a double hernia operation in January 1995, but by the end of the season had regained his first team place.[3] A regular member of the “Valiants” first team in 1995–96, he played in the 1996 Anglo-Italian Cup Final, as Vale lost 5–2 to Genoa. He made 31 appearances in 1996–97, as the club made its joint-second highest ever league finish. He spent November 1997 on loan at Shrewsbury Town, and made six Third Division appearances for Jake King's “Shrews”, before returning to Vale Park. He played three games for Vale in 1997–98, and was given a free transfer in the summer.\n\nHe signed with Wigan Athletic in June 1998. He played 26 times for the “Latics” in 1998–99, though did not feature in the play-off semi-final defeat to Manchester City. The club switched stadiums in the summer, moving from Springfield Park to the JJB Stadium, and also switched managers, replacing John Deehan with Ray Mathias. Griffiths played 20 times in 1999–2000, and was an unused substitute in the play-off Final defeat to Gillingham. He made 22 appearances in 2000–01 for manager Bruce Rioch, but did not feature under Steve Bruce.\n\nHe joined Rochdale in July 2001. Scoring four goals in 48 appearances in 2001–02, he helped “Dale” reach the Third Division play-off semi-finals, where they were beaten by Rushden & Diamonds. Manager Steve Parkin left Spotland in November 2001, and the club tried John Hollins, Paul Simpson and Alan Buckley in the role, before Parkin returned in December 2003. In his absence, Griffiths scored seven goals in 47 games in 2002–03, helping the club to avoid finishing at the foot of the table. He then made 35 appearances in 2003–04, as Rochdale avoided slipping out of the league by two places and five points. The defender scored four goals in 43 games in 2004–05, including a surprise hat-trick against Scarborough in a 4–1 win in the Football League Trophy on 28 September.[4] He played 29 games in League Two in 2005–06, before announcing his retirement from professional football in May 2006.[5] He then moved out of the Football League and joined Steve Burr's Northwich Victoria in July 2006,[6] and played 27 Conference National games before leaving at the end of the 2006–07 season.\n\n\nPost-retirement\n\nFor the last four years of his playing career he served on the Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association, reporting directly to chief executive Gordon Taylor and other senior members of the management board. Whilst playing he obtained a first class honours degree, a post-graduate marketing certificate, and qualified as a financial consultant.\n\nFollowing his retirement from football he began working in the financial services industry.[7] He became a trustee at the PFA, and co founded Pro Sport Wealth Management LLP, a Chartered firm of Independent Financial Advisers who specialise in bespoke planning for both individual and corporate sports professionals.\n\n\nStatistics\n\nSource:[8][9]\n\n  Club                     Season            Division              League   FA Cup   Other   Total\n  ------------------------ ----------------- --------------------- -------- -------- ------- ------- ------- ---- ---- ---\n  Apps                     Goals             Apps                  Goals    Apps     Goals   Apps\n  Port Vale                1993–94           Second Division       4        2        0       0\n  1994–95                  First Division    20                    0        2        1       3\n  1995–96                  First Division    41                    2        4        0       8\n  1996–97                  First Division    26                    0        1        0       4\n  1997–98                  First Division    3                     0        0        0       0\n  Total                    94                4                     7        1        15      0\n  Shrewsbury Town (loan)   1997–98           Third Division        6        0        0       0\n  Wigan Athletic           1998–99           Second Division       20       0        1       0\n  1999–2000                Second Division   16                    1        1        0       3\n  2000–01                  Second Division   17                    1        3        0       2\n  Total                    53                2                     5        0        10      1\n  Rochdale                 2001–02           Third Division        41       4        2       0\n  2002–03                  Third Division    42                    6        3        1       2\n  2003–04                  Third Division    33                    1        1        0       1\n  2004–05                  League Two        39                    1        2        0       2\n  2005–06                  League Two        29                    2        0        0       2\n  Total                    184               14                    8        1        12      3\n  Northwich Victoria       2006–07           Conference National   27       1        1       0\n  Career total             364               21                    21       2        40      5\n\n\nHonours\n\nPort Vale\n\n-   Football League Second Division runner-up: 1993–94[10]\n-   Anglo-Italian Cup runner-up: 1996[11]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n",

    "passage": "Ian Ruhte Part 1\n\n**Prologue**\n\nMy name is Ian Ruhte. I don't know why I am thinking that. Of course I know my name. I know who I am. I became who I am by choice. Not my choice, but the choice of that bastard Shiloh Conners. That's the man I'm going to kill.\n\nMy head hurts. I need something to drink. I'd drink a barrel of salt water right now to get this sweater off my tongue. I know who put me here. It was Shiloh Conners. He has to die.\n\nShiloh Conners beat me bad. I was just looking for a book. Yes, I was told that book contained the true history of the world. That book contained a lot more. It contained the true story of the downfall of the greatest leader the world had ever seen. It contained the true story about how trade was established from the fertile farmlands to the barren cities where everyone lived off what they could grow in their backyards and what animals they could cook.\n\nShiloh Conners didn't want anyone to read that book, and now I know why. Now I know and he has to die. There was a time when he didn't have to die. There was a time Shiloh Conners wasn't guilty. That was a long time ago. When he wasn't who he was now. When he didn't kill my wife. When he didn't beat me and leave me here. That was before I talked to a man who told me about the book.\n\nI need a drink.\n\n**Chapter One**  \n\nIan Ruhte slept peacefully on a straw mat, his wife pacing the fireplace. She couldn't sleep when he was going to leave just the next day. The next day arrived as she paced, wearing a rut into the floor in front of the embers. Ian turned over and saw his wife holding back tears, exhausted and tense.\n\n\"Doesn't make sense to kill yourself so slowly, girly. You need to stop worrying so much.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me not to worry. One of these days you're not going to come back. It's a dangerous job.\"\n\n\"Dangerous, yes. And it takes me away from you for long periods of time. But after this quarter I've passed the apprenticeship period and I get fellowship pay. That's the kind of money that can guarantee our lives.\"\n\n\"Is a guaranteed living better than a probable death?\"\n\n\"Red don't do this to me. You knew I was in training to be a field rigger. We met at a bar full of them!\"\n\n\"I just don't think it's worth it when there are so many safer jobs in town.\"\n\n\"Safer jobs won't make us wealthy.\"\n\n\"Wealth hasn't anything to do with it when you are laid out and dead.\"\n\n\"At least then you could collect some good insurance. You'd be set for quite a few years.\"\n\nRed glared at him. That was an enraging statement and always cut deep when Ian said things like that.\n\n\"That's cruel Ian. You're a cruel man.\"\n\n\"No crueler than I need to be. Honesty may be cruel but it has come to me quite nicely.\" He stepped closer and kissed his wife. Every kiss they shared was electric. That was what brought them together in the first place- that electricity. Ian washed his face and dressed. \"I'll send word if I'm going to be gone for more than a few days,\" he said. \n\n\"I pray you won't be. I need you here more often.\" Red sighed and wiped the weariness from her face. \n\n\"I love you Red. Please take care.\" Ian kissed her again, then went to the dresser. He grabbed his axe and hooks and strapped them on to his back. Then he grabbed a leather pouch and stuffed it in his pocket. He walked out of the door and Red sat down, breathed deeply, and fell asleep.\n\n**Chapter Two**  \n\nI remember the bar where I first met Red. It was called the Backwoods Game Lounge, and it was always hot. They kept it hot in there year round. The fire was constant and somehow managed to warm the whole place, while the drinks warmed me inside. It was the only place I could manage to go after rigging all day. It was physically exhausting to be an apprentice field rigger, but it made me strong. Not strong enough to kill that bastard, but strong enough to break into the Central House and find the book.\n\nI didn't only meet Red at the bar. I met the man who changed my life. Who opened my eyes to the truth. He called himself.. what did he call himself? The Wizard. Yes, that's right. He told me about the book. The history. Well, he thought it was a history. Or maybe he just told me it was a history. He probably knew what it really was. He knew who I really was, and he knew who that bastard really was and what he'd done. He probably knew what he'd do too. I think the Wizard should have died too. I don't know. Once I find and kill Shiloh, I'll find the Wizard and find out what he really knew. Then I'll kill him. \n\nThat book was no history. I read the chapter that I felt drawn to. It was clear that it may have been historical like a myth or something, but in reality I knew what it was. It was a prophecy. I was one of the subjects of the prophecy. Prophecy cloaked as a history. Clever, whomever wrote that. Whomever? Whoever? Not that it matters here in my mind. \n\nI wonder if the Wizard wrote this. He seemed like a smart man. Round face. Round glasses. Hair that curled out under his cap. He wasn't round, but every detail was. He cracked his knuckles a lot. He told me about the book and how I needed to read it. He saw me at the bar every day. He knew I liked to read. I'm a good reader. That's how I found the chapter so fast and figured out what it truly meant.\n\nHe had to have written it. He practically told me so himself. I wonder how old he really was. He didn't look more than forty. He had to be older. He begged me, pleaded with me to read the book. He knew it wasn't a history. He knew who I really was. He knew what I was going to do. \n\nHe knew what that evil man had done.\n\n**Chapter Three**\n\nIan woke with a start. His parents were arguing again. Five years young, he had a mane of wavy blonde hair. He didn't know much, but he knew when his parents argued it never ended happy. He hid himself away and listened to their yelling. His dad was always louder.\n\n\"I'm telling you Martha, they're driving the trade! He's paying off everyone and getting rid of anyone who won't take his money.\"\n\n\"Well then maybe your dad should just take his money. It couldn't possibly be worse.\"\n\n\"It is worse because he gets to dictate who trades what, when, and who they can trade it with. It's servitude. He has no right!\"\n\n\"He's young. The youngest ruler in the Central House that we've ever seen. He'll change as he grows into it.\"\n\n\"He lied and cheated his way in. Building his legacy on that foundation I don't think he's going to change. He's going to make the farmers his men with money or with violence. It's just wrong. My father and I are going to stand against him.\"\n\n\"You'll die.\"\n\n\"And I'll take out as many as I can with me.\"\n\n\"How could you be so cruel! Ian is only five. How on earth could I provide for him?\"\n\n\"You'll get my severance pay. You'll get income from the farm- my mother will see to that even if my father dies with me.\"\n\nMartha couldn't keep the tears from streaming down her face. Ian cried too, but no one could see him in his corner. He couldn't figure out what was going on. All he knew is that a few days later his dad was gone and his mom cried a lot. \n\n\"Ian, promise me you'll never leave me\" she begged of him.\n\n\"Of course mommy. I won't leave you.\" A child's promise. Pure, innocent, and sweet.\n\nIan took care of his mom for two more years until she died. She cried a lot. She didn't cry when she was dead. Ian thought that was better.\n\n**Chapter Four**\n\nI know why my dad died. I read it in the book. They thought it was a history. \"The Real History of the Central Houses\" it was called. Houses. As in more than one. I only ever knew the one. How can you have more than one center? It was in the book. There used to be two Houses. The City House and the Country House. \n\nI never knew there was a Country House. When I was a little kid all the country was were farmers and hunters and riggers. I knew I wanted to be a rigger. I didn't know what I'd wind up being. I didn't know I'd have nearly killed the man who lead the city house. I never called it the City House. I just knew it as the Central House. I went there when I was twelve to apply for apprenticeship. I was denied. Even without parents I couldn't apply until I was sixteen. Two years of apprenticeship and then I would become a fellow. Fellows got the good pay. No one likes being a rigger. Most people didn't make it past apprenticeship before they left and went to drive carts or take some city job.\n\nI was good at rigging. Taking down trees, moving them, digging, and building. It took a lot of work, and every day I was sore. That's why I went the the Backwoods Game Lounge. It was a place to relax and drink and just far enough to walk home and sober up some. Red came in one night. She was just a country girl who wanted a taste. Her first taste. I was seventeen. She was seventeen. I sat next to her and we hit it off. We were just sober enough to feel the electricity when we walked home.\n\nI grabbed a drink from a water barrel just a minute ago. Terrible water. City people get the worst of it. No water here. Used to be very little food. That's what the real history told me. The real history told me about how the Houses were united. I'm not sure if United is the right word, when one just destroys the other. The ruler of the City House killed farmers and replaced them with his own men. He was clever about it. He sent his men in two years prior to his taking the seat at the City House. He was raised to be the ruler, and his first act was to take over the Country House. He saved the realm. He saved the cities. He killed men and women and tore down the Country House. That's the truth of it. \n\nThe Wizard knew what I'd read, I know it. He knew I'd see past the history. He knew I'd see this as a prophecy. He knew that the ancient ruler was actually Shiloh Conners and that Shiloh killed my father and grandfather. Then he killed my wife. The ancient ruler was killed when he was 29, by a farmer's son. I am that farmer's son. It wasn't a history. It was a prophecy.\n\n",

    "passage": "[RF] Bright Eyes And Black Hearts Chapter 1 -That Disease Called Death\n\n Chapter 1\n-That Disease Called Death\n \nOne day, in the early fall of 2014, I was sitting in English class catching up on my long overdue homework. Now I’m sure you’d be able to classify me as the typical social butterfly in class; never shuts up, always has something to say, and everyone wants to hear it. If you assumed that, you would be right. My mom used to tell me the quietest she ever heard me is when I was a baby, but now I can't keep my mouth shut. I'm known pretty well here, mostly because I’m the kid that tried to steal the American flag from the flagpole just so he could get two packs of air heads(it was freshman year, I honestly don't know). The sad thing was I didn't even get the air heads.\nBack to what I was saying, I was doing my work and talking to my friend Seymour. Now Seymour, him and I have been best friends since I can remember. He has always been there for me, even though him and I are very much opposites. Brown hair, chiseled jaw, slight stubble that just makes the ladies drop their panties and declare their love for him. Unlike most guys who have those traits, he isn’t a complete douche. He is actually the biggest comic book fan I’ve ever met in my life. Ask him about football, the boy will have no clue, but ask him what issue Captain America’s shield got an inch wider and he will light up like a Christmas tree. Seymour was going on about this girl he met the other week, and how she seemed generally interested in what his personality and blah blah blah, I wasn’t paying enough attention to remember the details. All I could think about was Dana Roberts. The only thing I loved more than strawberries covered in chocolate. Dana and I had been dating for almost two years, and it was our anniversary soon. I had already spent my paycheck on a huge Costco bear and some roses. All I could think about was her. Nothing else seemed important. \n“Thomas are you even listening to me?” said Seymour.\n“What...oh yeah Seymour I’m glad you found a girl with a heart the size of your Batmobile replica.” I said (personally I love Batman, but I just have to insult my friend, because no one else will).\n“That’s the thing man, she is also a Batman fan! We were talking about The Long….”\nOnce more he lost my attention, but this time it wasn’t because of Dana. It was the police officers walking into the classroom. They were speaking to Mr. Thompson, my English teacher. He pointed at me.\nNow for whatever reason, the first thing I thought was “Crap, they’ve found my weed” which is stupid because I’ve never smoked, nor do I own any marijuana.\nThey walked up to me and I could hear Seymour quickly end his sentence about who Bruce Wayne is under the cape and cowl.\n“Are you Thomas Dickens?” said the slightly older looking one, with an expression on his face like he had just eaten some rotten candy.\n“Yes sir, is something wrong?\" I said, which is the universal translation for “I am about to get arrested”.\n“We’re going to need you to come with us” said Old Cop\n“Alright just let me…” I attempted to say.\n“We’ve already gotten your things” said the younger looking one with a 80’s cop mustache and eyebrows that were thicker than Fat Albert himself.\n“Please just come with us” said Old Cop\nI followed them out of the classroom, where I knew my classmates sat, staring at the boy they thought was just arrested.\nThe walk in the hallways was awkwardly silent, with the only thing close to a conversation being the back and forth squeaks of Young Cop’s shoes. I soon realized we were heading to Principal Tyrels’ office.\n The office sat dead quiet, with the woman who usually works the reception desk not being present. The air had a feeling of dread, like the roof was going to collapse on us all.\nThe cops lead me in to a room off to the side of his office I had never noticed before (I’ve only been once, you remember the flagpole incident). The room was small and looked like an interrogation room from Law and Order but with furniture around it and not as dark and didn’t have a Did-You-Kill-Her vibe. I saw Principal Tyrels sitting next to a older woman. 50’s, 60’s maybe by the looks of her. She was balling her eyes out into Tyrels shoulder and he had his hand around her, comforting her I assumed. When the officers walked me in, Tyrels looked up from the woman and gave me a glance that can only be described by “very sad” The woman noticed this look and turned towards me. Now her look, can be described as….hmm well let’s say “Holy Shit”. She stood up quickly and continued to look at me. She just stood there, no movements, just...watching me. Now being an expert of communication, I gave them an “Um, you needed me Principal Tyrels?”\nThe woman ran towards me and wrapped her arms around me in an extreme bear hug that, if any tighter, would have made me look like an empty bottle of toothpaste. Her tears made my shoulder instantly soaked, which kind of upset me because Dana had gotten me this shirt last Christmas. Tyrels had his hand covering his face, and the wiped his eyes, maybe wiping away tears, I still to this day don’t know what it was.\n“Thomas, your, um, grandmother is going to take you home now, we’ve put your things into her car” Said Tyrels.\n“Grandmother?” I questioned. I have never known I had a grandmother, or at least an alive one. Mom had told me she had died a few years before I was born.\n“Yes Thomas, your grandmother” said Tyrels\n“Come on now Thomas, let’s...let’s get you home now dear, thank you Richard” said my supposed grandmother after lifting her head from my tear-drenched shoulder. How did she know Tyrels first name? Some teachers here don’t even know it. I'm pretty sure his children don't even know his name.\nSeeing as I had no real choice, I followed my “Grandmother” out of the office and into the hallway leading to the parking lot. Old and Young Cop followed us until we reached the parking lot.\nWe arrived at her car, which looked like a Lexus but I didn’t really want to ask. I was too puzzled by everything to even think about stuff like that. My “Grandma” thanked Old Cop and Young Cop, and began to get into the car. Old Cop walked up to her and grabbed her shoulder. She turned in his direction and they locked eyes.\n“Julie...I…” He attempted to say before she pulled him into a deep embrace and she began crying again. This lasted for maybe 45 seconds or so. Young Cop stood there with his head down. After they left this embrace, Old Cop spoke.\n“Please, if you ever need anything just call me, you have my cell and work number”\n“I will. Thank you Michael” She said, and then stepped into her car. She beckoned me to get inside, which I did after some hesitation. Old Cop stepped away and we began to back out of the parking lot. Once we were on the road, she gave me a look and turned her focus back on the street.\nI watched trees and buildings pass, all the while, the woman never spoke a word. I would hear the occasional sniffle, but that was all\nI wanted to start conversation, but something kept me quiet, I don’t know what. It was maybe 15 minutes later we turned into my neighborhood. I finally had to say something.\n“Um...so can I ask who you are?”\nSilence\n“The Principal said you were my grandmother...is that true?\nOnce again, Silence\n“Hello...”\n“Please Thomas...just let me drive” she managed to say before erupting into tears.\nThat kept me quiet.\nI saw my house approaching a few minutes later. Maybe half a dozen cars were in my driveway. My supposed grandmother pulled off the road into the patch of grass that sat in front of my house.\n“Go inside Thomas, just please go inside” she whimpered.\n“Are you not coming?” I asked.\n“I...I can’t go into that house. Not with...Thomas please just go” She said. \"You're so much like her...I just wish...please go\".\nI exited her car, and right as I shut the door she sped away. I was left in a grass patch confused as hell. I swore I could hear her crying, even as she drove farther away.\nI began walking to my front door, but I didn’t want to go inside. Something was wrong, and I was afraid to find out what. It seemed every step I made sent me closer to the impending doom I was about to face. I made it to my front door and opened it and entered my house.\nGod, how I wish I had run away right then.\nI entered into a room of peeping eyes. My Uncle Rick’s being the biggest. My relatives sat in my living room, staring at me like I had walked in with a sword through my chest. My Aunt Barb stood up and walked towards me and hugged me in an embrace that felt loving, but mixed with pity. The rest of my Mom’s three siblings joined her, along with my four cousins.\n“Son...I...I’m so sorry. I wish..” My Uncle Ralph tried to say before I decided to find answers.\n“Uncle Ralph why are you sorry? What wrong? Why are you all here?” So many questions ran through my head, but those were the most important ones.\nI remember their next words like they were gunshots to the chest.\n I still bare their scars.\n“Thomas...” Aunt Karen started to say before she walked into the kitchen crying.\n“Thomas, earlier today...your mother she”\nBang\n “...She was hit by a drunk driver. She was..”\nBang Bang\n“Killed instantly. I’m so so sorry”\nBang. A shot to the head.\nI remember the things that happened next in blurs and pieces.\n \n\n\nI remember pushing my family out of the way and making my way to my bedroom. I wasn't in control of myself, a vessel of nothing but anger and desperation that was trying to claw its way out of the darkness. I remember finding myself on my bed with my phone clutched next to my ear. Bright white letters on the top of it read “Mom”\nUnder those, letters spelling “Connecting”\nThen a noise\nBeeeep\nAnother\nBeeeep\nAgain\nBeeeep\nThe words that sealed her fate soon came, and they were like a sledgehammer.\n“Hello, this is Kendal Dickens, I can’t get to the phone right now, please leave me a message and I’ll call you back later. Bye now!”\nI fell into something that can only be described as blackness, where nothing was real and everything was moving in slow motion.\n I don’t remember anything after that.\n Well that isn’t true.\nI remember the pain\nI remember the blackness\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I once heard that death is a disease, which infects one person and then kills that person. After this it spreads to others around them, but it doesn’t kill them. It just destroys them. They are brought down to their lowest, their darkest moments, and may never recover. Then death kills them eventually, and spreads again. This process has been infinite. And there is no sign of a cure.\nI believed maybe I had a vaccine, that maybe it wouldn’t spread to me quickly, that maybe I could hold it off for a while. Maybe, hopefully, death wouldn't give me a second glance as it passed by me.\nI was wrong.\nNo one can prevent its spread\nAnd now,\nI’m infected\n \n",

    "passage": "The cover up continues\n\nAn analysis of the New Zealand Defence Force response to the book _Hit and Run_\n\nNicky Hager and Jon Stephenson\n\n29 March 2017\n\nThe Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Tim Keating presented the NZDF response to the book _Hit and Run_ at a press conference on Monday 27 March 2017. For 45 minutes he and his colleagues suggested that everything in the book was incorrect.\n\nThe _Hit and Run_ authors have now had time to study the defence chief's statements. Our conclusion is that the NZDF criticisms are wrong – with one exception – and that they have failed to address almost everything of substance in the book. This is what a cover up looks like.\n\n1. The raid described in the book “is not an operation the NZSAS conducted”: INCORRECT\n\nThe information presented in Keating's press conference leaves no doubt that the book and the defence chief are talking about the same raid. Keating gave the name of the raid (Operation Burnham), the times and date (12.30-3.45am on 22 August 2010), the location in the Tirgiran Valley, and said the SAS arrived in two Chinook helicopters, used SAS snipers, found a quantity of ammunition in one building and had one SAS trooper injured by falling debris. All of these are details of the SAS raid publicised first in chapter 3 of the book. There were not two different raids with the same operation name at the same time in the same valley. It is obviously the same raid.\n\nAn NZDF power point presentation shown in the press conference showed three main SAS objectives in the valley called A1, A2 and A3. The book had already identified the SAS's main targets as being the house and guest house of an insurgent named Abdullah Kalta and the house of an insurgent named Naimatullah, neither of whom were present during the raid. The NZDF objectives A1 and A2 are the buildings belonging to Abdullah Kalta seen in a photo on p.60 of the book and NZDF objective A3 is the house of Nematullah shown on pp. 39 and 60 of the book.\n\n2. The SAS raid was in a different village with a different name: INCORRECT\n\nThe defence force claimed that the SAS raid occurred in a village called Tirgiran, not the villages of Naik and Khak Khuday Dad named in the book. This is not true. The locals know the names of their own villages and they are called Naik and Khak Khuday Dad. The raid occurred there.\n\n3. The SAS raid was about two kilometres from the position we gave in the book: CORRECT, BUT DOES NOT CHANGE THE STORY IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY\n\nAfter the NZDF press conference, Nicky Hager said that the authors stood by the whole story and that at most the NZDF denials might mean that the events in the book occurred two kilometres from where we thought they were, ie. a slightly different location in the isolated mountain valley.\n\nWe have checked the NZDF maps shown at the press conference and it appears the location of the raid and the villages is indeed slightly different to what our local sources told us. But the villages at that location are definitely called Naik and Khak Khuday Dad, and all the rest of the story in the book is unchanged. Likewise the photos in the book of the villages attacked in the raid are correct, as are the photos of the victims and destroyed houses.\n\nThe Defence Force leapt on this and tried to sow doubt about the rest of the book. Keating said the “central premise” of the book was incorrect; that there were “major inaccuracies – the main one being the location”. But the location is a minor detail, difficult to establish in mountains with no roads or detailed maps (there are no known maps of the valley that include the locations and names of the villages along it). Contrary to what Keating said, the central premise of the book is that the actions of the SAS and its allies in the villages of Naik and Khak Khuday Dad led to civilian deaths and injuries, destruction of houses, neglect of wounded people and then a cover up – and none of that has changed.\n\n4. The NZDF has now replied to the allegations in the book: INCORRECT\n\nThe defence force has not replied to most allegations in the book. Most strikingly, Keating's presentation did not address the deaths and injuries suffered by children, mothers and elderly people who were obviously not insurgents – which are the most important allegations in the book.\n\nThe allegations that the defence force has avoided or answered inadequately to date are:\n\n* SAS-controlled attack helicopters fired at civilians in Khak Khuday Dad village with many casualties, including the three-year-old child Fatima\n\n* SAS snipers appear to have shot at least one civilian, a recently graduated school teacher home on holiday\n\n* SAS-controlled attack helicopters pursued two farmers who opposed the Taliban along the valley and killed them\n\n* Twelve houses were destroyed despite there being no military necessity to do so\n\n* No assistance was given to the wounded at the time, including in houses that Defence now says it knew might have contained civilians\n\n* Nor did the SAS go back to render assistance later, despite knowing that civilians were likely to have been injured\n\n* The SAS returned for a second raid on the village Naik and blew up a house or houses\n\n* A bound and blindfolded prisoner was beaten by an SAS trooper while his colleagues looked on and did nothing\n\n* The prisoner was then handed over to the Afghan secret police who were known to have a notorious reputation for torturing prisoners\n\n* That prisoner was then tortured by the Afghan secret police and when the defence force learned about this it kept it secret\n\n* The SAS arranged the extra-judicial killing of some other insurgent suspects\n\n* The NZDF repeatedly denied and covered up what the SAS have done, and continue to do so to this day.\n\n5. An ISAF investigation has already occurred, there is no need for another inquiry: A WEAK SELF-SERVING ARGUMENT\n\nFirst it is important to explain about the investigation done in August 2010 by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) coalition headquarters, which was cited repeatedly during the NZDF press conference. In 2010 the subject of civilian deaths was very sensitive in Afghanistan and so ISAF was attempting to investigate all suspected cases of civilians being killed by ISAF forces. But these “assessments” were very far from being full or independent.\n\nThe ISAF investigation into the 22 August 2010 raid was completed in less than a week and did not involve anyone going to the area or talking to the affected villagers. It included a review of attack helicopter weapons system video and concluded that several “errant rounds”, caused by a gun sight malfunction, “may have resulted in civilian casualties”. However reports from SAS members and local people interviewed for the book describe multiple heavy attacks that wounded and killed civilians in different locations. Thus the hastily-conducted ISAF review appears far from being adequate. It is silent on most of the allegations in the book.\n\nThere is no need for New Zealand to rely on the brief and inadequate ISAF review. Most of the information needed to confirm whether or not the allegations in the book are correct is located here in New Zealand, in the SAS files. The best option is an independent inquiry where this information can be gathered and assessed.\n\n6. Keating said the insurgents may have used civilians as human shields; aircraft video showed insurgents were killed; the conduct of the New Zealand ground forces was “exemplary”; and so on: UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS AND SELECTIVE INFORMATION\n\nMuch of Keating's presentation was unsubstantiated assertions. This does not help the public find the truth since the defence force has an obvious interest in avoiding bad news about itself. He also said that the book claimed the SAS “deliberately killed civilians”, which we did not say. If we are correct that bad things are being covered up, we cannot expect the people at the heart of the cover up to provide impartial information. Once again, this means that the only acceptable option is a full and independent inquiry.\n\n7. Lieutenant General Tim Keating told the press conference: “The ground force commander was an NZSAS Officer who controlled both the ground activities and provided clearance, after the appropriate criteria had been met, for any involvement of the aircraft. These elements were co-ordinated by an air controller in his location.” CORRECT AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nThis statement contradicts earlier statements by the government (in 2014) where ministers suggested that if there had been any civilian deaths they were the responsibility of the US pilots, not the New Zealand SAS. It confirms what we said in the book: that the SAS commanders in charge of the raid have responsibility for deaths and injuries caused by the US attack helicopters, which they controlled and had requested to be part of the raid.\n\n8. Finally, Keating told the press that there were legal complications for having an inquiry: INCORRECT\n\nThis is not correct. We are not proposing an inquiry by the defence force about itself. The government has the power to launch a full and independent inquiry at any time. We believe the NZDF is trying to avoid a full and independent inquiry precisely because some officers are scared of what it will show. But the issue will continue to fester, as it has for years, until that happens.\n\n© Scoop Media\n\nJoin the Scoop Citizen Community\n\n20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving.

    "passage": "[ SFHR] The Shapeless thing Part 1\n\n\"Well, in layman's terms I can honestly say that I have no idea what it is\"\nI sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose, not bothering to mask my dissatisfaction in front of the Professor \"Can you explain to me what data you have in scientific terms?\"  I asked irritably \nThe scientist nodded, his bald head shining in the floodlights in the cave. \"Certainly\" he said as he picked up a data pad \"The composition of the device is a complex mineral containing both organic and inorganic elements, only a few of which we can readily identify. The rest are totally new to us. We do   know that it gives off very faint electromagnetic signals. Remarkably the frequency seems to shift randomly, going from infra-red and radio waves, down to the UV spectrum. So far the analysis of these signals has yielded negligible results. Sometimes we detect slight magnetic fields, coming from it and sometimes we don't. The origin of the  structure, the nature of its shape, its purpose, its power source (if any), its cultural significance, the means of its construction, and most importantly, what it does, are beyond  current comprehension due to  all our extensive experiments being completely inconclusive\"\nI groaned \"So, in other words...\"\n\"We have no damn clue what this thing is\" The Professor finished, wiping his head with a damp cloth. \n\"Seriously this thing could be anything, maybe  a xeno construct, or something from the lost colonies, whatever it is, it's old,  it’s been in this hole for a least six millennium, and is most likely much older than that\"\nI walked around the structure, set into the ground of the cave... well it wasn't a cave exactly; a cave implies an opening, something that can be accessed naturally. Not this place. I guess the best word to describe it is as a cavern, a deep dark hollow, inexplicably existing almost a mile beneath the surface of Hupp,   the official designation given to both the mining colony and the planet upon it resides.\n\n I took a closer look at the object, brushing a strand of black hair away from my eyes. I needed to get it cut, but outside of Sol, good barbers were hard to find and I didn’t trust Xeno barbers, mostly because the majority of them do not have hair , and are not used to shaping it,  plus most of them have horrible fashion sense.\n\"So, remind me, Professor Gunnson, what does this place mine again?\" \n\n“Well, this particular colony rests over a rich ore of the mineral Cooperite, which contains palladium and Platinum, quite common for an Outer-world on this Spiral. Hupp-town (what the miners call their colony) primarily works with the extraction of the ore, but it is shipped off to the Central Hub of this Solar System to be refined.\n\"And how long has this mine been operational?\"\n\n\"Ah...roughly 20 years, in earth time of course, Mr. Demmit\"\n \"Soooo\" I began \" Why  is it that  a sophisticated mining operation like this,  with over a decade’s experience working this patch of dirt, no doubt performing countless sonar and thermal underground imaging, had no idea that this place  existed until they  physically broke into it?\"\n\nGunnson shrugged his shoulders, 'That's another mystery, I guess. The funny thing is, after this place was found, subsequent imaging actually mapped out this very room, despite identical previous scans being unable to detect it. Perhaps it was some   sort of Obstruction field, made so that this cavern would be unidentifiable by any sort of scans unless physically broken into, which would support the idea of it being an alien device.\"\n\n\"Hmm\" I said and started at the structure again. It was indeed a most strange thing.  It was completely black, darker than Obsidian, without pattern or variation and quite tall, at least six feet. Its shape (if it even had one) was undeniably strange; the closest approximation I can give is of a three dimensional paint splatter, a chaotic conglomeration of artistry and design. Spheres which curved away into trapezoidal ridges resting on tiny poles that should not have been able to support its weight. On its top  a split hollow that looked like a mouth  with mismatched triangular teeth, resting diagonally atop a cyclopean lump, from which strands of the material branched off to form animalistic  designs, such as claws  and wings, and disturbingly, a human face. \nOn one side, a variety of non-Euclidian shapes seemed to have been fused together, haphazardly, like a child’s tower of building blocks. It was an incomprehensible work, almost schizophrenic when you'd thought you understood the shape from looking at one part, it would connect to something completely different and incompatible to the previous segment you saw. This inconsistency carried over to its construction. In one light you would swear it gleamed like iron pained black, others it had the texture of   polished rock, and some had no texture at all, just the sheer blackness of it. Like the mysterious shapes, whenever you sought to find the join, where the two different materials met, you could not find it, the distinction melted the further you looked, with the only results being a headache.\nThere was an indescribable wrongness to it, like it was something that had no right existing.  Even if it had been resting out in the sunlight it would have looked simply weird, but down here, in the oppression of the cavern, with the floodlights throwing shadows onto the surrounding walls and stalactites, it looked especially creepy. \nI pulled out a cigarette \"Is it safe to smoke in here?\" I asked.\nGunnson nodded \"yes, we hooked up an extra ventilation fan in the chamber, though I would prefer it if you would refrain from doing so\" \nI lit up and took a drag, feeling a little calmer. The professor sighed. \n\"So...Mr. Demmit\" The Professor broke the silence \"Why exactly did the Institute send you here?\"\nI Looked at him \"You received a transmission from the main office shortly before my arrival, what did it say?\"\nGunnson frowned confusedly \"Just that you were going to 'appraise' the artifact\"\nI nodded \"Well, Professor, that's exactly what I do. Whenever something new is discovered (or claimed to be discovered), be it a new breed of Digworm in a R&amp;D lab, a more efficient Warp-core in a parking garage, or an ancient ceremonial bowl from an archeological dig site, etcetera, the moment the Institute gets wind of it, they send me in to inspect it and then I advise them of what potential use they could receive from these discoveries.\"\n\n\"So, hypothetically speaking, if you were to make a judgment now, what would the fate of this artifact be?\"\nI shrugged \"Probably be shipped off to a museum somewhere. Since it has no apparent cultural or historical significance, it would either be labeled as an ' unknown curio' or 'ancient outsider art'...though the discovery and research teams will be acknowledged and suitably rewarded\" I added quickly, noticing the sudden shock on the professor's face.\nThe Professor smiled, visibly relaxing \"Well, that's good to know\"\n\"Yes, though I’m hoping it will not come to it. I must confess that this...\" I gestured to the statue, \"thing, greatly interests me, whilst there have been artifacts found in similar circumstances, none were like this. I...”\nSuddenly a beeping sound came from the professor’s coat. \"Excuse me\" he said bashfully. He took out his holopojector and activated it. The gas particles fanned out and took on the shape of a Sondhar, a fur covered creature, with a mass of feelers on its head.  \"Ah, Nul-Parast, Gunnson exclaimed\n\" what's the word?\"\nThe Projection started talking. \"None of the Old Songs mention any sort of artifact as the one we have found, and the Keepers of the Histories don't recognize it either so it's nothing from the Sondharian Empire.\"\n\nThe Professor grunted \"Shame about that, I was banking on it, what about Que and Dox, they contact you yet\"\nthe alien shook its head \"I believe they are still doing research, though I will put them through to you the moment they have a lead\" And with that the projection dissipated into a mist of glimmering particles. \n\nThe Professor tucked the device away again. \"Sorry about that, you were saying?\"\n\nI cleared my throat “I was saying that I hope this artifact does turn out to have significant value to the Institute after all\"   and to myself I thought inwardly.  The more valuable the find, the more I get paid, and I was hoping that this wasn't another dud. Its mysterious origins had certainly intrigued me, but the way this was going, it wasn't going to provide much of a paycheck.\n\nThe Professor grinned ruefully \"We can but hope, how long will your appraisal period be?\" He asked.\n\"One month, Earth Calendar, with additional time granted should I request it from the Institute and if they consent to it.\"\n\"Then we'd better get back to work then\"\nI smiled,  \"seems that way, I'm going to need all your findings, and data you have gathered so far\"\n\" Coming right up\" said Gunnson.\nI spent the rest of the day   reading over the data the Professor had provided; it had not been much help. Every test the scientists had preformed had spit up the exact same results, unknown or data not found. It was if the structure had simple appeared in this universe one day. Maybe someday someone could have discerned what it was, but the Institute never liked the phrase “someday” almost as much as they disliked “indefinite” or “worthless”. I sighed as I put the finishing line on my preliminary report.\nWill require more time to gather additional data on the object. Additional data will be provided in future reports.\n I pressed send, and the holoboard blinked. The message had just entered the fold-space. I yawned and stepped out of the small study tent that had been erected. To my surprise, the cavern was empty, whilst earlier it had been crammed with workmen and scientists, now only the solitary figure of Professor Gunnson remained, sitting on a small fold out chair, with one hand holding drink. When he saw me he gave a small wave. \n“How’d the report go?” he asked \n\n“Fine, just gave them the data and my current opinion on the object, where’d everyone else go?” I asked, looking around.\nGunnson pointed upwards with his free hand “Back to the surface, it’s past nightfall now, though you can’t tell it from down here. I like to stay down overnights sometimes, whenever I go to a dig site, in case I get an urge to run a test during the night”\n“Does that happen often?”\nThe Professor grinned “More often than you’d think, help yourself to a beer by the way, they’re little stale but nice and cold” He gestured to a cooler that rested at his feet. \nI reached in and pulled out a bottle, I twisted the top off and took a swig. The Professor had been right, it was old, no doubt it had been come from earth itself, but it was ice cold and, man after an afternoon working it tasted almost new.  I smacked my lips “Thanks Professor”\n“Oh please, call me Harold”\n“Only if you call me Wade” I said as I took a seat next to him. \n“So Wade, what’s your story” Harold asked “How did one like you become an “appraiser” for the Institute?” \nI shrugged, “nothing special really, was born and raised on Earth, went to University in England got a masters in Commerce, you know the score.  I did some work as a head hunter for hiring agencies, you know, finding fresh new talent for their companies, was pretty good at it too.  One day the Institute offered me this job.  Naturally I took it at once. Ever since I was a little boy I had wanted to go into space, well I suppose everyone does really.\n“Not me” The Professor interjected “Can’t stand space travel, never could. Even now, I need to anti-anxiety medication before I get on a craft, and God-forbid I should look out a window! Space always terrified me.”\n“In what way?”  I asked curiously \n“The blackness “The Professor replied “It’s seems so…hostile, you understand, I mean anything could be hiding in the darkness, and our worlds, everything we ever know and care for, are just pinpricks amongst the blackness”\nI had to laugh. “I’m sorry” I said, stifling a remaining chuckle “But I mean \"hiding in the blackness of space?\". You got to admit, it sounds pretty silly”\nHarold shrugged “maybe so but it still gives me the nerves. Anyway my story is a bit like yours really. Got a masters in Xeno archeology and studies, and got poached by the Institute, till I wound up here, nothing special really”\n\nFor a while we just sat and drank our beers in silence. I found myself staring at the statue again, something about it didn’t quite seem right.  Hadn’t   that wing been on the other side? And had that trapezoidal bit at the top always been there? And suddenly it hit me.\n“Harold” I said “does that statue seemed to have changed shape to you?”   I asked.\nThe Professor laughed nervously. “I thought it was just  me , but yes, it seems to  sort of shift its configuration and shape every so often, sometimes it happens once a day, sometimes  every other hour!” \n\n“Really?” I said in amazement, you’ve seen this happen?”\n“Well… not seen per se, it just sort of...shifts, one minute it looks like one particular object, the next it’s …changed”\n “What about video footage?”\n\nHarold shook his head “that’s the thing, after the first time it happened I set up a camera to record the statue. The next time it changed shape, I watched the footage, and found that the footage from before showed the statue in the *exact same shape*.  I tested all the cameras and found no faults; it was like something was actively retroactively changing all images of itself to suit its current one. I recorded it through five shape changes, every time I did, the previous footage would show the statue in its current state”\nI gave a sigh “More mysteries” I yawned, I needed some shuteye. I stood up and stretched. “Where can I sleep around here?”\n“There’s bunking on the surface, but the lift takes about half an hour to get there, alternatively, I set up a couple of cots in the  service tent.”\n“That’ll suit me just fine” I said, heading towards the area.\n“Good night and don’t let this place give you nightmares” the Professor called over jovially.\nI laughed; “The statue is creepier than anything my mind can come up with” I chuckled as I headed inside, and lay down on the bed.\n",

These novels contain mostly illustrations in anime or manga style. They are usually published in _bunkobon_ size (A6 – 105 x 148mm). Light novels are not very long. The length is comparable to a novella in US publishing terms.\n\nLight novels are very popular in Japan as you can see in Japanese bookstores.\n\n[Japanese Bookstore]\n\n\nWhere does the term come from and what does it mean?\n\nThe word “light novel” is actually not an English word. It is a _wasei-eigo_ (literally translated “Japanese-made English”) which is a Japanese term formed from words in the English language.\n\nThe term is everywhere used where you read such novels. In Japan you will use the word _raito noberu_ (sometimes also _ranobe_ or _rainobe_ as an abbreviation) which is the Japanese term of light novel.\n\nIn the western culture light novels are normally called Japanese Novella.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a novel and a light novel?\n\nIn short: Light Novels are usually shorter and they also contain few illustrations. In addition they are easier to read. This is particular because the text contains much simpler and easier to read modern _kanji_.\n\nThe illustrations are mostly at the beginning of capitals or when a new characters respectively a new place is described. On the picture below you see an example on how a light novel is build up. Left an image from the scene and to the right the text to read.\n\n[Example Page]\n\nIn typical light novels you will find mostly black and white illustrations. But today you also find many novels that include colored illustrations.\n\n[Colored Illustration]\n\n\nWhy is a light novel styled like an anime or manga?\n\nThe reason because light novels are styled like anime or manga is because of their history and they are actually from Japan.\n\n  Light novels are an evolution of pulp magazines. To please their audience, in the 1970s, most of the Japanese pulp magazines, which had already changed from the classic style to the popular anime style covers, began to put illustrations in the beginning of each story and included articles about popular movies, anime and video games.\n\n  The narrative evolved to please the new generations and became fully illustrated with the popular style. The popular serials are printed in novels.\n\n  In recent years, light novels' stories have been popular choices for adaptation into manga, anime, and live-action films, though in the case of the former two, usually only the first two novels are adapted.\n\nInformation\\ from\\ wikipedia,\\ englishlightnovels,\\ animanga.wikia,\\ tvtropes.\n\nPictures\\ from\\ englishlightnovels,\\ afrobonzai.unblog.\n\nanswered Aug 7 '14 at 14:07\n\n[]\n\nWhen referring to a novel, you'd be talking about...\n\n  A fictitious prose narrative of book length, typically representing character and action with some degree of realism.\n\nTherefore I always assumed a light novel to be a short story of sorts, something you could read on the bus or on the train. After looking it up, I was wrong. A light novel apparently is a Jenglish or wasei-eigo expression for a novella, which would be a short novel, but not as short as a short story according to it's wiki page.\n\nSo before I continue and answer your questions, I'll let wikipedia explain what a light novel would be.\n\n  A light novel (ライトノベル raito noberu?) is a style of Japanese novel primarily targeting middle and high school students (young adult demographic). \"Light novel\" is a wasei-eigo, or a Japanese term formed from words in the English language. Such short, light novels are often called ranobe (ラノベ?) or LN in the West. They are typically not more than 40,000–50,000 words long (the shorter ones being equivalent to a novella in US publishing terms), rarely exceed 200 pages, often have dense publishing schedules, are usually published in bunkobon size, and are often illustrated. The text is often serialized in anthology magazines before collection in book form.\n\nIS THIS TERM ONLY USE IN JAPAN?\n\nYes it is. If you would use the term in the west, you would be referring to Japanese novella.\n\nHOW IS A LIGHT NOVEL DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR NOVEL?\n\nI guess novels would printed in the A5 format, but a light novel would be printed in the Bunkobon format, which would be the A6 format.\n\nIS A LIGHT NOVEL USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR ANIME OR MANGA ADAPTATION?\n\nSince the target group of light novels are primarily middle and high school students, it wouldn't surprise me if most of them are. They aren't exclusively used for anime or manga adaptations though. If you read further on the wiki page it is mentioned that popular movies as Star Wars have also influenced the content. But they do mention that\n\n  In recent years, light novels' stories have been popular choices for adaptation into manga, anime, and live-action films, though in the case of the former two, usually only the first two novels are adapted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile searching about Light novels I encountered the wiki how page on Light novels.

In the English usage, the term is only used to refer to such books produced in Japan (i.e. there cannot be a legitimate American light novel just in the same way as there cannot be American anime).\n\n\nHow is a light novel different from a regular novel? Except for light novels being... light, are there any other differences?\n\n-   A light novel is short in page length and usually features intermittent manga-style illustrations --- but that same description can be said of many Japanese children's novels! IN CONTRAST, LIGHT NOVELS ARE FOR ALL AGES & DEMOGRAPHICS. Although it is approximately equivalent in length to the Western novella, THE LIGHT NOVEL CANNOT BE CALLED A JAPANESE NOVELLA: the Japanese term for \"novella\" is 「中編小説」(_chuuhen shousetsu_), and is not used to refer to light novels (it is used for short stories by Murakami Haruki, for example, which are considered high-quality literature).\n-   Though each published volume is short, light novels can stretch into long series. Some of the series premier in magazines, so you can think of those like LITERARY SERIALS (think Charles Dickens); a serial is EPISODIC, \"a printed format by which a single larger work, often a work of narrative fiction, is published in sequential installments.\" As such, a serial is written differently than a full-length novel that gets published into a chunky book at once. A serial must grab the reader's interest in the first chapter, and plot out the development so that at least one exciting thing happens in each chapter. It intentionally ends chapters with a cliff-hanger when possible. It cannot leisurely build to the climax, or take a whole chapter or so to only tell you what a minor character is doing somewhere else (which a novel printed all at once is free to do). Thus, THE FORMAT OF THE STORY IS STRUCTURED IN A SPECIFIC WAY THAT OTHER NOVELS ARE NOT BOUND TO. This is another aspect in which the light novel differs from average Japanese children's novels. This is also why, if _Harry Potter_ had been written in Japanese with manga-style illustrations, it still would not have been a light novel: it is not short in length and it was published all at once rather than serialized.\n-   A large percent of light novels are read by people involved in some sort of SUB-CULTURE, such as manga, anime, and/or gaming. However, just because a certain percentage of light novels include _moe_, light novels are not limited to such content and tone; ALL GENRES ARE INCLUDED, from horror to romance to sci-fi. Some are the novel-equivalent or adaption of shoujo manga and are marketed at young girls. Some genres are less likely to be exported based on the otaku demographics outside of Japan, so those genres are less well-known to the international subculture community.\n-   IN CONTRAST TO STANDARD JAPANESE (AND WESTERN) NOVELLAS AND NOVELS FOR ADULTS, light novels are OFTEN ILLUSTRATED.\n\n\nAre light novels used exclusively for anime or manga adaptations?\n\n-   No, some light novels are serialized as their own original works in non-manga magazines and NEVER HAVE A RELATION TO MANGA.\n-   Some light novels now ORIGINATE ONLINE and never have a relation to manga or any other mediums.\n-   Some light novels are created as ADAPTIONS of manga/anime/games after the manga series or game has gained a lot of popularity.\n-   Some light novels start as original works and then GET ADAPTED into manga/anime/games/live-action afterward.\n\n\nAre there any light novels that do not use manga-style drawings?\n\nYes. Artists of the earliest light novels included those who worked in 油絵 (_abura-e_ = OIL PAINTING) and 水彩画 (_suisaiga_ = WATERCOLOR). In 1987, the 少女小説 (_shoujo shosetsu_ = girl's novels) genre began, and for the first time shoujo manga style was used, which helped establish the trend of manga-style art as the standard for light novels from the 1990s.\n\nWhile illustrations are a common feature, SOME LIGHT NOVELS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ILLUSTRATIONS WHATSOEVER. The ones without any illustrations are less likely to be exported to other countries and are therefore less well-known outside of Japan.\n\n[]\n\nanswered Jun 1 '15 at 0:36\n\n[]\n\nseijitsuseijitsu\n\n10.3k49 silver badges76 bronze badges\n\n  Is this term only use in Japan?\n\nIt originated in Japan but not exclusive of Japan. There are light novel writers in Korea and China, since it can be used for anything written within certain criteria.\n\n  How is light novel different from regular novel?\n\nIf I had to describe it in few words: a easier to read novel.\n\nIf you check out some novels, like _Another_ and see most Light Novels the difference is evident. Light novels have shorter paragraphs, characters less complicated to read (i.e. the appearance of obscure Kanji in a sentence is rare), and generally shorter.\n\n  Is light novel use exclusively for anime or manga adaptation?\n\nActually, most light novels (LN from now on) don't make it to anime production, and some are adapted to manga to promote the novel itself rather than to make a illustrated carbon copy of the LN. This is, as with all business, mostly motivated by marketing reasons, rather than some secret rule. Granted, if your LN is popular, it will get advertised in more media (manga, anime, live action, etc.) than if it's not popular.\n\n  Is there any light novel that do not use manga style drawing?\n\nDrawing depends on the artist, and most artist also do other things like doujins or the very manga. The drawing is merely a representation of what they know to do, rather than following a predefined style.\n\nanswered Aug 12 '14 at 0:24\n\n[]\n\nBraiamBraiam\n\n1,4981 gold badge11 silver badges37 bronze badges\n\nThe expanded definition and description of \"light novel\" appears to correspond to pulp fiction which started as magazine serials in the 19th century in English and Western European language markets - with the exception of it having the sensibility to be age appropriate for young-adults or the modern YA market. The format length appears to be driven by the market, and series light novels are much like series pulps - but with aiming the stories to be age appropriate for 10 and 11 year olds (and up).\n\nanswered Apr 11 '18 at 14:08\n\n[]\n\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

    "passage": "Tripping and Finding a Dollar\n\nSherry Masood\nMeeting a Stranger\nTripping and Finding a Dollar\n\tThe bay always makes the sunset a much bigger event. It’s like you’ll miss it twice, once for the reflection, once for itself. A man is leaning over the bridge, contemplative. The bridge is bustling and honks are as common as laughs. Couples walk hand in hand and bicyclists fly past in their separate lane. An Asian family passes by the man. The mother leads the family, looking at her surroundings for threats against her children. A scowl painted on both of the parents faces; you can tell it’s been a stressful day. The first three members of the family of four walk past the man without skipping a beat, but a little boy with a short black mop on top of his head pulling up the rear stops to stare. The man turns to stare. For a few seconds they analyze each other, imaging life on the other side. “Kenji! Pali Pali!” The boy reaches into the pocket of his coat and pulls out a piece of chocolate. “Here, this’ll make you feel better; it’s what my Appa gives me when I’m sad.” The man smiles for the first time in what seems like his life and pats the child on his head as a worried mother grows an impatient look on her face. “Run along now”. \n\tThe sun’s golden lining disappears over the coast line leaving behind a dark purple afterglow. It’s one of those dawns that has the moon coming early to say goodbye to the sunlight- a full moon, he’s been waiting.  In what seems like minutes to the man, dawn turns to pure night and people file off of the bridge. Each car passing by has a more significant impact on the near silence of salty waves and the low whistle of the breeze. He wasn’t on Earth time anymore. Time is like a balloon- the more you fill it, the heavier it becomes. This particular balloon was filled with just the very basics: the night air, starlit darkness on a rippled reflection, and *thump*,*thump*. A new sound emerged- the sound of concrete being slapped by the sole of a boot. A Hispanic man, a stranger looking to be in his early 40’s emerges out of the darkness. Shaggy brown hair lies messily atop a wise looking face, empathetic grey eyes seem to stare into the man’s soul. The stranger stands maybe five feet from the man and leans over the hanging of the grey bridge. “Do you know what serendipity is?” asks the stranger. “Yeah… kinda”. “It’s like a happy accident”, the stranger explains. “Like tripping and finding a dollar?” “Yeah… kinda.” \n\tThe two men, one quite older than the other, stand side by side as if swallowed whole by the bright white gem. “Ya know, I saw you here last week, and again two nights ago” the stranger said. Silence responds. “Are you not sure about it? Or were you waiting for something?” The man looks at the stranger, then at the moon, gesturing with his chin. “I see”.\nThe stranger pulls out a flask. “Do you have something you can use as a cup?” he asks the man. The man looks down and thinks. He reaches in the inside of his coat and pulls out a mint container. “There’s some left, want any?” he asks the stranger. “I’m about to drink liquor”. \n“Oh… Right”, the man empties the mints into the bay. \n\tThe stranger pours the man a shots worth of amber, he asks, “What do we toast to?” “How about to the liquor?” “To the liquor!!” exclaimed the stranger as they tip their vessels together. Down the hatch the shots of gasoline go. “Ya know, I kinda hate whiskey but right now, this is all right” said the man. “It’s an acquired taste. Let’s get you on your way”. Two more shots poured, two more warm stomachs, two happy brains. *Braaaawaarooop*, the stranger lets out a devastating belch, the man responds with his own, less powerful, but nonetheless impressive, belch- the sounds of solidarity in the night. Two piss streams go into the bay. The darkest part of the night has already passed.\n\t“So what is it anyway?” the stranger turns and asks inquisitively. “What’s all gone so wrong?” \nThe man starred at his own two feet. “Where do you want me to start?” he looks down at the strangers’ feet.  “I’ve just moved to this city and my whole worlds back on the other side of the country probably falling in love without me. My family doesn’t give a damn about me and they don’t even notice I’m gone most of the night. The one thing that cared about me as much as I cared about it, my dog, was just put down for being a potential killer. My whole fucking life has been swept up from under my feet and now I’m having drinks with a stranger on a bridge well past midnight in a town I know nothing about...” the man sounded like he’d wrung out the last of the words he could manage for the moment. Turning with sparkly moonlit eyes and a manic kind of smile he asks, “So, how’s that?” The stranger looks back alarmed and sorry, “Listen I-*pop*…. *pop* *pop*.\n\t“Those sounded just like suppressed .45 rounds!” the man exclaims as they both turn to face the west entrance to the bridge. They start running, pounding against the steelwork. As they approach the entrance they see two shadowy figures running quite a distance away; turning into an abandoned side street. They were running from the scene they had left. The man and the stranger approached the first café adjacent to the bridge and found themselves in a horrific scene. A sprawl of spilled out purse objects: lipstick, lotto tickets, napkins, a cleaned out wallet. It was all fallen in a trail leading up to a woman’s hands-pale and relaxed. A pool of dark blood was collecting under her abdomen; a stream began flowing across covering her face down figure, dying the tips of her straight black hair. The blood was approaching her other hand which was clutched onto tight by a smaller hand.  A sudden rustle caught both men off guard and they turned to see a small child clutching his leg, a quiet terror erupting from his eyes. His mouth was open like he was screaming but hardly any sound could be heard. “Oh, fuck” said both men, one taking a step back, the other shocked frozen. This small boy, no older than 8 had a hole going through his entire left thigh, past the muscle and bone, and all the way through to the other side. The man kneels down and holds the boys hand, “Can you hear me? You’re going to be okay. We’re going to get help and you’re going to be okay.” The boy, still looking as if he was screaming, shook his head yes as tears glided across his face. “I don’t understand it, why can’t he speak?” asked the stranger. “He’s… he’s a- a mute.” said the man. “We’ve got to get him to a hospital, is there one close by?” “Only a block away on Grant” said the stranger “There’s a Sutter.” The man gently as possible placed one arm under the boy’s jeans, damp and warm from the blood and the other on the top of his back and lifted the boy up. “Let’s go”. “Wait. I need to call the police and wait for them here. You take the boy.” The man looked at the stranger firm in the eye and nodded, “Okay”. \n\tThe boy had been in the E.R. for three hours now. The sun had risen. The police had come to gather information. He had none for them. They told him the woman couldn’t be identified. There was nothing to go off of. They didn’t mention the stranger so neither did he. He starred at his own two feet and thought about if the boy would ever be able to walk again. It looked bad. He knew he didn’t have to stay. The operators room swung open and an older doctor came through, “You must be Jack?” he asked. “How is he?” “Well we were able to save the leg.” “Oh thank god” Jack said, exhaling relief. “But the boy is still in no condition to walk. It’s still too early to tell when that’ll approve but it’s safe to say he will recover.” “That’s such a relief doctor, thank you so much.” “I think if there’s someone that boy should be thanking, it’s you Jack. You know I bet he’s been wondering about you. I’d like him to rest some more but you can come visit him in an hour or so if you’d like.” “Thank you doctor.” \n\tJack went into the chair and slept for the first time in almost two days.\n\t“Hey”\nThe boy was lying in the hospital bed with a cotton leg and sad eyes that looked straight into and out of Jack. “I know this must be horrible for you.” The boy raised his arm and ushered Jack to come closer. The boy had something clutched in his hand. Jack approached him and raised his hand. The boy wrapped both hands around Jack’s hand and held on. Jack began to tear up as he felt something small and cold put into his hand. The boy closed Jack’s hand around the golden ring that had once belonged to his mother’s right hand. He had been holding it this whole time. ",

    "passage": "Susan Wallace\n\nSUSAN ARNOLD ELSTON WALLACE (December 25, 1830 – October 1, 1907) was an American author and poet from Crawfordsville, Indiana. In addition to writing travel articles for several American magazines and newspapers, Wallace published six books, five of which contain collected essays from her travels in the New Mexico Territory, Europe, and the Middle East in the 1880s: _The Land of the Pueblos_ (1888), _The Storied Sea_ (1883), _The Repose in Egypt: A Medley_ (1888), _Along the Bosphorus, and Other Sketches_ (1898), and _The City of the King: What the Child Jesus Saw and Heard_ (1903). She was also the wife of Lew Wallace, a lawyer, American Civil War general, politician, author and diplomat. Susan completed the manuscript of Lew Wallace's two-volume autobiography following his death in 1905, with the assistance of Mary Hannah Krout, another Crawfordsville author. Wallace died in Crawfordsville in 1907.\n\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSusan Arnold Elston was born on December 25, 1830 in Crawfordsville, Indiana. She was the third daughter, the fourth of nine children, born to wealthy and influential parents, Isaac Compton, a Crawfordsville dry goods merchant, and Maria Eveline (Akin) Elston, whose family were Quakers from upstate New York.[1][2] Susan was educated at home in Crawfordsville and at Dr. Gibbons' Friends' Boarding School in Poughkeepsie, New York.[3][4] While at boarding school, she studied literature, geometry, and writing, but preferred music, especially playing guitar and piano.[5][6]\n\n\nMarriage and family\n\nSusan married Lew Wallace on May 6, 1852.[7] The couple first met in 1848 at the home of Joanna and Henry Smith Lane in Crawfordsville. Joanna was Susan's older sister; Lane was Wallace's former military commander during the Mexican War and became one of his closest associates.[8] At the time of their courtship, Wallace was a prosecuting attorney in Covington, Indiana. His earlier reputation for getting into trouble caused Susan's father to disapprove of him initially, but the courtship continued.[9][10][11] Susan accepted Wallace's marriage proposal in 1849. Three years after their first meeting, the couple were married at the Elston family home in Crawfordsville.[12] Late in life she still described him as “my first, last, and only love.”[13][14]\n\nThe Wallaces established their first home at Covington, where Lew continued to practice law, but moved to Crawfordsville in 1853, to be closer to her family.[15] The couple had one son, Henry Lane Wallace, born on February 17, 1853, in Covington. He was named for their brother-in-law, Henry Smith Lane.[16]\n\nAlthough Susan was a talented writer and musician, she preferred to remain largely in the shadows as her husband's companion and advisor.[17] Lew became a major general during the American Civil War, who was later appointed governor to the New Mexico Territory and served as the U.S. Minister to the Ottoman Empire. He also went on to become one of the most celebrated American authors of the 19th century, following the publication of _Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ_ (1880).[18]\n\nOn occasion, Susan accompanied her husband to his various posts, but Crawfordsville remained their home.[19][20][21][22] In February 1879, Susan joined Lew in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he served as the territorial governor, but she disliked its dusty, dry climate, and returned to Indiana in October.[23] In 1881 Susan accompanied her husband to his diplomatic post in Constantinople, Turkey, and traveled throughout Europe, Egypt, and the Holy Land during their years abroad.[24] When Lew's diplomatic assignment ended in 1885, the Wallaces returned to Crawfordsville, where Susan was prominent in the town's literary community. She befriended other local writers, including Mary Hannah Krout and her sister, Caroline Virginia Krout, and continued to write.[25]\n\n\nCareer\n\nSusan Wallace was a published author long before her husband was.[26] “The Patter of Little Feet”, one of her best known poems, first appeared in the _Cincinnati Daily Gazette_ on April 17, 1858. Largely forgotten by modern readers, her works focused on home, friends, travel, and Christianity.[27][28] She was also very interested in women's roles, especially after traveling with her husband to Turkey and the Middle East. Her travel writing is described as more reflective and poetic than a detailed travel guide. She offered romantic and sentimental narratives of her travels in addition to vivid descriptions, with touches of realism and humor.[29]\n\nSusan's writing first appeared in American magazines and newspapers, but collected essays later appeared in her books, which were published between 1883 and 1903, after she had reached the age of fifty.[30] During her brief time in the New Mexico Territory in 1879, Susan described her experiences in a series of articles that she had previously sent to the _Atlantic Monthly_, the _New York Independent_, and the _New York Tribune_. A collection of these essays were later included in her book, _The Land of the Pueblo_ (1888).[31] Susan also wrote about her travels abroad for American magazines and syndicated newspapers. Collected essays were later published in four books: _The Storied Sea_ (1883), _A Repose in Egypt, A Medley_ (1888), _Along the Bosphorus, and Other Sketches_ (1898), and _The City of the King: What the Child Jesus Saw and Heard_ (1903).[32][33] _Ginèvra; or, The Old Oak Chest, A Christmas Story_ (1866), which is based on a Samuel Rogers poem, initially appeared in 1884 in the _New York Independent_.[34]\n\nIn addition to her own writing, Susan was involved in her husband's literary career. Lew acknowledged Susan's role as his editor, reader, and critic, and attributed much of his success in writing to her literary criticism.[35] Wallace was writing his memoirs when he died in 1905, and Susan completed his manuscript with assistance from Mary Hannah Krout, another Crawfordsville author. Using correspondence, speeches, notes, and other materials, they added another 204 pages to his two-volume work, _An Autobiography_ (1906).[36] In volume two, page 796, of the 1906 edition, Susan added: “And here the Autobiography ends. What follows must be a plain record of facts without attempt at polish or effect.”[37]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nSusan Wallace died in Crawfordsville on October 1, 1907, at the age of seventy-six.[38][39] She is buried beside her husband in Crawfordsville's Oak Hill Cemetery. A collection of her papers are preserved as part of the Wallace Collection at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis.[40][41]\n\n\nSelected works\n\n-   _The Storied Sea_ (Boston: James R.

    "passage": "Left the Cape at Home\n\nAny words in italics are supposed to be my internal monologue at the time.  Thanks for reading\n\n*I’m drunk, I’m out of shape, I worked out today and my muscles are still sore, I don’t even know those guys.*  A couple hundred really good reasons not to get involved crashed through my mind when I saw the fight break out down the street.  Two seconds into my sprint I had to admit all of those reasons sounded pretty damn logical, convincing even, but 5 guys had just jumped 2 young men and some part of me will always have an irrational hatred for assholes who don’t see the need to fight fair.  It didn’t look like any of them were older than 20 and I am reminded for the 100th time that night I am not nearly as young as I want to be.  The panic in my wife’s voice as she shouts “don’t” tells me that I’ll have another fight to deal with when I get home; I change that “when” to an “if” as I remember that I haven’t been in a proper fight in almost a decade. 30 yards in about 4 seconds, *not bad old man*, I still promise to put a little more time in on the jump rope collecting dust in the basement.\n\tBy the time I get there both of the friends are on the ground catching a couple of rounds of punishment, 2 on 1 victim and 3 on the other.  I’m praying that both the unlucky bastards know how to cover up properly.  I’m praying at least one of the attackers has a flash of conscience and backs off.  I’m praying one of the awestruck bystanders with their smart phones out had enough sense to call the cops before they tweeted about watching a curb stomping.  I’m praying that Blue Cross covers injuries incurred during a White Knight fiasco.  I’m praying, but I put down religion a long time ago and I don’t want to choke on my own hypocrisy…or spit…seriously I need to up my cardio.\n\tI grab one of the attackers from behind and rip him off the victim.  He’s big, real big; I thank god I was diligent in my leg workouts for the past month and put all my weight and a full hip rotation into slinging the jackass into the nearest wall.  The sound of his back hitting the glass makes me wonder who’s responsible for property damage in this situation.  I don’t dwell on it long, I just scream some dark rambling thought about him needing to get lost, it sounds great and dramatic in my head and the guy was smart enough to take off running.  The second guy barely noticed his friend’s absence and is still teeing off on the grounded kid.  He pulls a hand back to hammer another blow home and I hook his arm to stop the strike.  I use my other arm to put him into the sloppiest chokehold ever attempted *how the hell does this always work in the movies, is there like a height requirement to choke somebody out?* I want to tell the kid to get off the ground and get to safety but my wife is already helping him up.  Inside I smile and wonder if that poor schlub knew he was going to end this night being rescued by a 5’2’’ southern spitfire putting on her best Valkyrie impression.  I stop hoping the thug I’m restraining will pass out from boredom and opt to simply kick the back of his leg as I pull him backwards by the collar of his shirt.  The ground meets him with all the love concrete can muster but he bounces up quickly enough to start running after his wayward friend.\n\tI turn just in time to see a punch coming my way, *seems like lucky number three has decided to end your tiresome meddling*; 26 and I still think like a Scooby Doo extra.   My hands are way out of position to block but the punch is slow, a sloppy left handed jab that tells me the guy is either real drunk or a rank amateur at dishing out pain.  I drop my weight down and get as low as my jeans allow me to and instantly regret every squat and lunge I’ve done in my life.  A little bit of head movement and the meatbag’s fist misses me by just enough to remind me I’m human; human and a lot more fragile than I want to believe.  But his momentum has put me in perfect range to satisfy a craving almost ten years in the making and for one shinning second the years of rust and day-to-day boredom are burned away by the pure fire of righteousness and madness coming together in perfect anarchy.  I’m not a superhero, not even particularly strong, but I have a punching bag at my house and just enough job related stress to make the frame rattle 3 or 4 times a week.  I plant my feet so hard I make a blister and tear it at the same time, so hard my vanity tells me the sidewalk probably cracked, and I dig in with a body shot straight from hell.  Somewhere between a hook and an uppercut I connect with a lower rib and take his and my breath away.  I push him towards his still fleeing friends and he takes the hint.\n\t*Everything hurts*…keep standing….*visions a little blurry*…keep breathing…*you’re still outnumbered*……pussy.  Still 2 guys left and they’re raining down sloppy kicks on this poor son of a bitch like it’s a middle school soccer game and the ball just happens to be calling for help.  How long has it been?  A minute?  An hour?  Time loses meaning as the world tilts at an awkward angle forcing me to take a lurching step to keep from falling into the sky.  *You’ve done enough, this is insane!  Somebody else can take it from here damn it the cops should be here any second.  You’re not a hero*.  But I always told myself that if I could be a hero I’d try to be like Luke Cage.  I’d help the little guy and always stand up to fight for the underdog.  I’d take a beating so those weaker than me would be safe from harm.  And I seriously have an irrational hatred for people who don’t fight fair.\n\tThe last two nasty fucks throwing kicks have a wall about 3 feet behind them and I smile.  My friend is a personal trainer and she’s showed me an exercise she recently started having some of her clients do.  She starts people out by just doing a handstand against a wall and holding it for as long as they can, but as they get better she has them try to do a couple of inverted push up type things.  Of course I try it unsupervised like a man is supposed to and it’s hell on the shoulders, but I fill out a suit better than I have in years.  She tells me that one of her clients has gotten to the point where he can do a full set of 10 pretty easily.  I can do about half of one before every injury from high school football reminds me that I wouldn’t make it in the NFL, or CFL, or arena league, or high school football.  I plant a hand on each attacker’s chest and push; fancy battle tactic I got going on here.  Both goons travel about 5 feet to the wall previously 3 feet behind them and the impact makes me cringe and smile at the same time.\n\tI feel my needle drop to E and I know that I just burned up everything I had and then some.  The kid on the ground bolts to his feet and makes it half a block in a heartbeat.  Good survival instincts on that one, but he could have at least stuck around to watch me get my shit kicked in on his behalf.  My arms are useless and I might as well be wearing concrete shoes for all the good my legs are doing me.  For the first time I actually look at the people I’m fighting and I just want to scream at the two of them how young they are.  They have their whole lives ahead of them and they could be throwing that all away on some stupid fight in the middle of the sidewalk.  18, I wonder if any of them are 18 and would be tried as adults if something terrible had happened.  *Children, they’re just fucking children*.  One of the punks asks if I want a piece too.  My heroic reply is a wet cough that sounds like too many Gin and tonics.  I tell myself that it was a good run.  I tell myself that I did the right thing.  I tell myself that, worst case scenario at least I’m wearing clean underwear.  No man should die with dirty underwear on; I think my grandfather told me that.  But I see fear creep into the two attackers eyes, and with all the grace of a gazelle high on shrooms they bolt as a squad car shows up to the scene blue and red lights flashing.  I lean my back against the wall and listen to my heart play a nice salsa beat.  My wife and the cop ask me if I’m ok at roughly the same time and I answer both with a half dazed nod.  The world comes back into focus just long enough for me to hear that both the victims only sustained minor injuries, some bruises that’ll hurt like a bitch come morning and one bloody lip between the two of them.  I smile and the cop’s face makes it pretty clear he thinks I look like a madman but I couldn’t care less.  I haven’t felt this good in ages.  Neither kid wanted to press charges and distantly I wonder what those two did to deserve an ass kicking, but the thought doesn’t last long.  This isn’t a comic book, I don’t wear a cape, I don’t have to investigate and get to the bottom of the story.  I’m just a guy who feels a little bit better about his workout routine.  Both kids thank me for the help, I tell them to be safe in my best adult voice knowing damn well that I wouldn’t listen to me at their age.  I nod with what I hope is a grim look on my face, turn around and go home.\n",

    "passage": "Hou Junji\n\nHOU JUNJI (died April 29, 643[1]) was a Chinese general and official who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong in the Tang dynasty. He is best known for leading the Tang military campaigns against the Gaochang and Tuyuhun kingdoms. In 643, he was implicated in a plot by the crown prince, Li Chengqian, to overthrow Emperor Taizong, and was executed.\n\n\nDuring Emperor Gaozu's reign\n\nHou Junji's date of birth is unknown. Little is known about his family background other than that he was from Bin Prefecture (豳州, roughly modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). It was said that he was pretentious and always wanted to appear impressive. He favored using the bow and arrow; while he never achieved greatness in archery, he became known for his fighting abilities. At a point early in the reign of Emperor Gaozu, who was then still trying to reunify China after the collapse of the Sui Dynasty, Hou came to serve under Emperor Gaozu's son, the major general Li Shimin the Prince of Qin. While serving under Li Shimin, for his accomplishments, Hou was created the Viscount of Quanjiao. He also became a close associate of Li Shimin, often offering Li his strategies.\n\nBy 626, Li Shimin was locked in an intense rivalry with his older brother Li Jiancheng, who was the Crown Prince. He feared that Li Jiancheng would kill him. Hou, along with Li Shimin's brother-in-law Zhangsun Wuji, Zhangsun's uncle Gao Shilian, and the general Yuchi Gong, advised Li Shimin to act first and ambush Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi. Li Shimin agreed, and in 626 ambushed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, killing them. During the subsequent battles between Li Shimin's forces and Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's forces, Hou led Li Shimin's forces. Following these battles, Li Shimin effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to make him the crown prince, and then to yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong).\n\n\nDuring Emperor Taizong's reign\n\nLate In 626, when Emperor Taizong personally ranked the contributions of the generals and officials in order to grant them fiefs, Emperor Taizong ranked five of them—Hou Junji, Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, and Yuchi Gong to be contributors of the highest grade, and Hou was created the Duke of Lu.\n\nIn 630, Emperor Taizong made Hou the minister of defense and gave him the additional designation of _Canyi Chaozheng_ (), making him a _de facto_ chancellor.\n\nIn 634, Emperor Taizong, sending the senior general Li Jing to command the campaign against Tuyuhun's Busabo Khan Murong Fuyun, made Hou and Li Daozong the Prince of Rencheng Li Jing's assistants on the campaign. By spring 635, Tang forces achieved initial victories, but Tuyuhun forces then burned the grazing grass to cut the food supplies to Tang horses. Most Tang generals wanted to withdraw, but Hou advocated continued advance, and Li Jing agreed, eventually allowing complete victory, as Murong Fuyun was killed by his subordinates, allowing his son Murong Shun, whom Tang supported, to become khan (as Yidou Khan).[2] Around the new year 636, after Murong Shun was assassinated by his subordinates, Emperor Taizong sent Hou with an army to try to secure the throne for Murong Shun's son Murong Nuohebo.\n\nIn 637, as part of Emperor Taizong's scheme to bestow prefectures on his relatives and great generals and officials as their permanent domains, Hou's title was changed to Duke of Chen, and he was given the post of prefect of Chen Prefecture (陳州, roughly modern Zhoukou, Henan), to be inherited by his heirs. Soon, however, with many objections to the system, the strongest of which came from Zhangsun Wuji, Emperor Taizong cancelled the scheme, although Hou's title remained Duke of Chen.\n\nIn 638, Tufan's Songtsen Gampo, after hearing that the rulers of Tujue and Tuyuhun were all able to marry Tang princesses, requested to marry one as well, but was rebuffed by Emperor Taizong. In anger, he launched a major attack on Tang, capturing a number of prefectures. Emperor Taizong sent Hou to counterattack, assisted by other generals Zhishi Sili (), Niu Jinda (), and Liu Jian (). Niu was subsequently able to defeat Tufan forces at Song Prefecture (松州, roughly modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan), and Songtsen Gampo, in fear, withdrew, but still requested to marry a Tang princess. (This time, Emperor Taizong agreed, sending Princess Wencheng, a daughter of a clansman, to marry Songtsen Gampo.)\n\nAround the new year of 640, Qu Wentai (), the king of Gaochang, formed an alliance with Western Tujues who are hostile to Tang. Emperor Taizong sent Hou, assisted by Xue Wanjun (), to attack Gaochang. When Hou arrived at Gaochang, Qu Wentai died of distress and was succeeded by his son Qu Zhisheng (). Rejecting a proposal by some of his generals to ambush the Gaochang nobles when they were burying Qu Wentai (finding that doing so would be immoral), he put Gaochang's capital under siege, forcing Qu Zhisheng to surrender. Emperor Taizong annexed Gaochang territory except for three cities, which Gaochang had seized from Yanqi, and therefore were returned to Yanqi after the king of Yanqi met with Hou to congratulate him), and Hou returned to the Tang capital Chang'an with Qu Zhisheng and his subordinates as captives.\n\nUpon Hou's return to Chang'an, however, he found himself in trouble, as it was alleged that Hou had taken for himself treasures from the Gaochang imperial treasury and forced certain Gaochang captives to be his slaves. The other generals, seeing Hou's example, also did likewise, and he was in no position to stop them. Emperor Taizong, when he found out about these events, put Hou and some of his generals under arrest less than 10 days after their return to Chang'an. However, upon the advice of the official Cen Wenben, Emperor Taizong released Hou.\n\n\nDeath\n\nHou Junji was resentful that, despite his great achievement, he was put under arrest, albeit briefly. In the spring of 643, when fellow general Zhang Liang was sent out of the capital to serve as the commandant at Luo Prefecture (洛州, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan), Hou tried to provoke Zhang by asking him, “Who squeezed you out?” Zhang, in jest, responded, “Other than you, who can squeeze me out?” Hou responded, “I conquered a kingdom, but I ran into someone throwing a temper tantrum big enough to overturn a house. What strength do I have to squeeze you out?” He then rolled up his sleeves and yelled, “I am so unhappy that I would rather die. Do you want to commit treason? I will commit treason with you!” Zhang secretly reported this exchange to Emperor Taizong, but Emperor Taizong pointed out that this was a private conversation with no corroboration, and took no action on it.[3]\n\nIn 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Hou's was one of portraits commissioned.\n\nAround the same time, however, Emperor Taizong's crown prince Li Chengqian was becoming fearful because Emperor Taizong had greatly favored another son, Li Tai the Prince of Wei, and Li Tai was making designs on the crown prince position. Li Chengqian therefore gathered a group of political and military officials around him to consider overthrowing his father, including his uncle Li Yuanchang () the Prince of Han, his cousin Zhao Jie (), and brother-in-law Du He (杜荷, Du Ruhui's son). Hou's son-in-law Helan Chushi (), the commander of Li Chengqian's guards, was also part of the plot, and through Helan, Li Chengqian invited Hou to join the plot as well, as Hou agreed. However, he was deeply disturbed by his own involvement, and he developed insomnia. His wife sensed that something was wrong, and told him, “You, Duke, are an important official of the state, so why are you acting like this? If there is something you are doing wrong, you should report yourself so that your life can be spared.” However, Hou did not do so.\n\nHowever, Li Chengqian's plot was betrayed by his guard Gegan Chengji (), and after an investigation ordered by Emperor Taizong and conducted by Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, Li Shiji, as well as responsible officials from the supreme court and the legislative and examination bureaus of government, Li Chengqian was removed. The other conspirators, including Hou, were sentenced to death. Emperor Taizong initially considered commuting Hou's death sentence because of his accomplishments, but the other officials opposed, and Emperor Taizong stated to Hou, “I have to bid you, Duke, farewell. From now, I can only see your portrait!” Both he and Hou wept. As Hou was about to be beheaded, he stated to the general overseeing the execution, “I, Hou Junji, am not the type to commit treason, but I stumbled many times and reached this point. But as I destroyed two kingdoms as a general, please speak for me to His Imperial Majesty to request that I could have a son remaining to carry on the lineage, on the basis of my accomplishments.” Emperor Taizong, when he heard this, pardoned Hou's wife and children but exiled them to the modern Guangdong region, and confiscated his properties.\n\nIt was said that years earlier, after Emperor Taizong ordered Li Jing to teach Hou strategies, Hou reported to Emperor Taizong, “Li Jing is about to commit treason.” When Emperor Taizong asked him why, Hou responded, “Li Jing only teaches me basic principles and does not teach me the best strategies, keeping them for himself.” When Emperor Taizong asked Li Jing about this, Li Jing responded, “This is proof that Hou Junji will commit treason. China is secure right now, and the empire is united. What I taught him is sufficient to use against barbarians. If not for treasonous purposes, why would Hou want to learn all of the strategies?” At one point, Li Daozong also spoke to Emperor Taizong, stating, “Hou Junji has too much ambition and too little talent. He overvalued his achievements and found it shameful to be lower in position than Fang Xuanling and Li Jing. Even though he serves as a minister, he finds the position insufficient. I believe one day he will create a disturbance.” Emperor Taizong responded, “Hou Junji is very talented and capable of serving in any position. It is not that I am unwilling to give him the highest post; it is just that it is not yet his turn. How can I distrust him and believe that he will commit treason?” After Hou was put to death, Emperor Taizong apologized to Li Daozong.\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   _Old Book of Tang_, vol. 69.\n-   _New Book of Tang_, vol. 94.1\n-   _Zizhi Tongjian_, vols. 191, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197.\n\nCategory:643 deaths Category:Tang dynasty generals from Shaanxi Category:Chancellors under Emperor Taizong of Tang Category:Tuyuhun Category:Politicians from Xianyang Category:Tang dynasty politicians from Shaanxi Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Executed Tang dynasty people Category:People executed by the Tang dynasty by decapitation Category:Executed people from Shaanxi Category:Transition from Sui to Tang\n\n[1] [http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A4%D3%A9v&reign=%ADs%C6%5B&yy=17&ycanzi=&mm=4&dd=6&dcanzi= 兩千年中西曆轉換 ]\n\n[2] This account, contained in Hou's biography in the _New Book of Tang_, however, conflicted with Li Daozong's biography, which stated that _Li Daozong_ was the one who supported further advancement.

    "passage": "Halloween is tomorrow, and horror fans everywhere are probably getting ready to replay some of their favorite scary games to celebrate the spooky occasion. We've already listed some of our favorite horror games to play this Halloween, but it turns out some of the weirdest, creepiest, most disturbing video game sequences actually come from games that aren’t even part of the horror genre proper.\n\nHere are some of the scariest moments in non-horror games.\n\n1. The morgue in Batman: Arkham Asylum\n\nBatman is a dark series to begin with, but I wouldn’t classify the Arkham games as straight-up horror. That said, it was really awesome to see such a classically scary sequence in Batman: Arkham Asylum. It starts pretty tame: as you approach the double doors of the Arkham morgue, swarms of roaches begin to skitter across the dirty linoleum. Once inside, you might be prompted to roll your eyes: the spooky whispers and slamming freezer doors are a little cliche. But then you try to leave.\n\nThe room has looped in on itself, leading you back to the same morgue. Bruce’s parents taunt him from bodybags on the table and from the last bag, Scarecrow leaps out, plummeting you into a bizarre stealth sequence set across a hallucinatory obstacle course. One of the most clever and unexpected parts of the game.\n\n2. Ravenholm in Half-Life 2\n\nThe seasoned horror game fan won’t find much to fret about when it comes to Ravenholm’s generically spooky atmosphere, this is the place you run into some of Half-Life 2’s most feared enemies. The first Poison Headcrab awaits you here, as does the dreaded Fast Zombie.\n\nWhile it’s definitely a creepy level, the scare factor kind of fades when you’re running around slinging saw blades at everything with the Gravity Gun, but it would be a shame to leave this iconic level off the list.\n\n3. Grand Theft Auto 5’s ghost lady\n\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is a massive game brimming with fun easter eggs to find, from the Vinewood Zombie to the elusive Bigfoot, but it’s the Ghost of Mt. Gordo that makes this list for how unexpectedly creepy it is. This lady looks like someone I’d expect to run into in a Fatal Frame game or a Takashi Shimizu film, not hiking up in San Andreas. No thanks!\n\n4. Gone Home’s basement\n\nI know I’m not the only one who went into Gone Home expecting something spooky to happen and even though it never really does, that house wasn’t eerie on accident. Returning to a new home after traveling abroad to find your parents and little sister gone, a letter on the door demanding you don’t look for her, is freaky enough.\n\nLater, you find a crumpled up note warning you not to look in the attic, newspaper clippings that explain why the kids at school call your sister “The Psycho House Girl,” a ton of hidden rooms in the walls, a jump scare involving a creepy cross, and other clues that, among all the cute romance stuff, start to point to something having gone afoul while you were away.\n\n[]\nGetting into the basement is one of the high points of the game’s mounting tension, as it’s classic horror film fashion to have something go down in there. Nothing does, but Gone Home does have a disturbing backstory that the perceptive player will pick up on, and many of the clues that help piece that subplot together are located down in that basement...\n\n5. Max Payne’s drug trip\n\nThe gritty male action hero bent on revenge for the loss of his family is nothing new, but the first Max Payne really made us feel that… well, pain. Not only does the first game make you play the fateful day at the very start, when Max’s wife and baby are killed by violent druggies, but it forces the scene on you again much later when Max himself is administered an overdose of the same drug.\n\nHis ensuing trip is horrifying, set in a nightmarish funhouse version of his home where the echoes of his wife and child haunt the halls. A nauseatingly zoomed out camera makes Max’s return to that awful night that much more feverish, as does the surreal sequence at the end when he drops into a hellish abyss paved with the blood of his family. Jesus, Max Payne.\n\nQueue depressing piano track.\n\n6. Halo 3’s cavemen\n\nPlenty of games have cool, hidden places and people for the wandering player to find. Sometimes they’re friendly, like Half-Life 2’s singing Vortigaunt tucked away in Water Hazard. Other times, they’re super freaky and unexplainable and seriously what is this:\n\n[]\nYeah. In Halo 3’s Sierra 117 level, you can find a family of cavemen. They’re just sitting there, oddly proportioned and completely immobile. No idle animation, no way to interact… though if you shoot at them, blood does spurt out, so that’s pleasant.\n\n7. Colonel’s freakout in Metal Gear Solid 2\n\nAnyone who played Metal Gear Solid 1, with its infamous Psycho Mantis fight, should’ve been prepared for something like Metal Gear Solid 2’s twist involving the Colonel. But when it did roll around, the Colonel’s nonsensical rambling and glitchy skull face weren’t any less freaky.\n\n8. Fighting Giygas in Earthbound\n\nEarthbound may have been the inspiration behind weird horror games like Yume Nikki and the bizarre RPG Lisa, but it isn’t really a scary game in itself. Despite that, it still manages to have one of the most horrifying bosses of all time in the form of Giygas, an evil cosmic entity that looks like a swirling, screaming face.\n\nThe final fight against him is a hellishly psychedelic encounter, with Giygas constantly twisting and warping in the background. Fighting him is useless and eventually, the only thing you can do is pray. A bunch of kids trying to summon the love of the people they’ve helped in the face of evil incarnate is pretty intense. When Giygas is finally defeated, it goes out in an abrasive explosion of red static.\n\n9. The screams of Oolacile in Dark Souls\n\nDark Souls, among many other things, has masterful sound design. The combination of music, environmental sound effects, the growl of enemies, and other layers of sound are composed with such care that you could probably listen to the ambient track of each area and recognize it immediately. (There’s actually a website just for ambient Dark Souls tracks.)\n\nAnother thing Dark Souls is good at is storytelling. It trusts you to piece things together with little exposition: just things you pick up from characters, item descriptions, and the world around you. Few places in Lordran combine this type of storytelling and careful sound design as well as Oolacile Township, where over the heavy wind in the valley you can hear the screams of its residents as the abyss takes over.\n\nSure, it’s easy to point to New Londo Ruins and say that’s the scariest place in Dark Souls, considering it’s literally inhabited by ghost skeletons, but the subtle horror of the Abyss and the fallen Oolacile is too good to pass up.\n\n10. The Statue of Happiness in Grand Theft Auto 4\n\nGrand Theft Auto’s parody of American culture was never as scathing and dark as it was in Grand Theft Auto 4. Liberty City, the GTA parallel of New York where protagonist Niko Bellic makes his home, is also home to the Statue of Happiness. This Statue of Liberty-inspired monument stands tall and green off the coast, clutching a coffee cup in one hand and a tablet that mocks America’s treatment of immigrants in the other. Besides its maniacally grinning face, there’s nothing really scary about it on the surface.\n\nGo inside, though, and the sight is a little disturbing: suspended within is a huge, anatomically correct human heart, hung up with chains and still beating. Definitely one of the weirder easter eggs in a Grand Theft Auto game. If you get too drunk in The Ballad of Gay Tony and pass out, you can actually wake up in there. Not something I’d want to see with a hangover, or ever.\n\n11. Pokemon’s Lavender Town\n\nThe creepy theme song, all the urban legends about child suicide resulting from said creepy theme song, the ghost town vibe, the fan theory about Gary’s dead Raticate… even though only half of what makes Lavender Town scary are verifiable, this place is one of the most undeniably off-putting places in an otherwise pleasant game.\n\n12. Cave sounds in Minecraft\n\nWhy. Why, Minecraft? I’m just sitting here, digging for some coal, minding my own business, and you have to play _this_? I know I’m not the only one who’s played Minecraft into the late hours of the night, until my music playlist has reached its end, leaving me in utter silence down in the darkness of a deep mine.\n\nIt’s true that the hiss of a Creeper might cause more alarm for someone carrying a lot of valuable items, but for me, it’s when I’m lost somewhere underground and start hearing these otherworldly sounds in the absence of everything else that I start to freak out.\n\n13. When Ecco the Dolphin’s pod is abducted\n\nEcco the Dolphin looks like a pleasant game on the surface. You’re a dolphin in a bright, sunny part of the ocean, hanging out with all your friends, enjoying life, doing cool flips, ignoring all the creepy stuff the other dolphins are saying (“Ecco, if we breathe air, why do we live beneath the waves?”) when suddenly – aliens.\n\nJump too high in the air and a horrible sound freezes you in mid-air, sucking all the surrounding sea life out of the ocean, including your dolphin podmates. (Skip to about 1:00 in the video to see it.) When it’s over, you plummet back down into the eerie dark blue of the ocean, suddenly alone. If you think that’s scary, wait until you see the game’s final boss. Nope.\n\nThis list doesn’t include all the weird, scary, or disturbing moments in non-horror games, but these are some of our favorites. There are still classics like Thief’s Shalebridge Cradle and Ocarina of Time’s Bottom of the Well… we could go on and on.

    "passage": "Attenuated vaccine\n\nAn ATTENUATED VACCINE (or a live attenuated vaccine) is a vaccine created by reducing the virulence of a pathogen, but still keeping it viable (or “live”).[1] Attenuation takes an infectious agent and alters it so that it becomes harmless or less virulent.[2] These vaccines contrast to those produced by “killing” the virus (inactivated vaccine).\n\nAttenuated vaccines stimulate a strong and effective immune response that is long-lasting.[3] In comparison to inactivated vaccines, attenuated vaccines produce a stronger and more durable immune response with a quick immunity onset.[4][5][6] Attenuated vaccines function by encouraging the body to create antibodies and memory immune cells in response to the specific pathogen which the vaccine protects against.[7] Common examples of live attenuated vaccines are measles, mumps, rubella, yellow fever, and some influenza vaccines.[8]\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nViruses may be attenuated via passage of the virus through a foreign host, such as:[9][10]\n\n-   Tissue culture\n-   Embryonated eggs\n-   Live animals\n\nThe initial virus population is applied to a foreign host. Through natural genetic variability or induced mutation, a small percent of the viral particles should have the capacity to infect the new host.[11][12] These strains will continue to evolve within the new host and the virus will gradually lose its efficacy in the original due to lack of selection pressure.[13][14] This process is known as “passage” in which the virus becomes so well adapted to the foreign host that it is no longer harmful to the vaccinated subject.[15] This makes it easier for the host's immune system to eliminate the agent and create the immunological memory cells which will likely protect the patient if they are infected with a similar version of the virus in “the wild”.[16]\n\nViruses may also be attenuated via reverse genetics.[17]\n\n\nAdministration\n\nAttenuated vaccines can be administered in a variety of ways:\n\n-   Injections:\n    -   Subcutaneous (e.g. measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, varicella vaccine, yellow fever vaccine)[18]\n    -   Intradermal (e.g. tuberculosis vaccine, smallpox vaccine)[19]\n-   Mucosal:\n    -   Nasal (e.g. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine)[20][21]\n    -   Oral (e.g. oral polio vaccine, recombinant live attenuated cholera vaccine, oral typhoid vaccine, oral rotavirus vaccine)[22][23]\n\n\nMechanism\n\nVaccines function by encouraging the creation of cells, such as CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, or molecules, such as antibodies, that are specific to the pathogen.[24] The cells and molecules can either prevent or reduce infection by killing infected cells or by producing interleukins.[25] The specific effectors evoked can be different based on the vaccine.[26] Live attenuated vaccines tend to help with the production of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and T-dependent antibody responses.[27] A vaccine is only effective for as long as the body maintains a population of these cells.[28] Live attenuated vaccines can induce long-term, possibly lifelong, immunity without requiring multiple vaccine doses.[29][30] Live attenuated vaccines can also induce cellular immune responses, which do not rely solely on antibodies but also involve immune cells such as cytotoxic T cells or macrophages.[31]\n\n\nSafety\n\nLive-attenuated vaccines stimulate a strong and effective immune response that is long-lasting.[32] Given pathogens are attenuated, it is extremely rare for pathogens to revert to their pathogenic form and subsequently cause disease.[33] Additionally, within the five WHO-recommended live attenuated vaccines (tuberculosis, oral polio, measles, rotavirus, and yellow fever) severe adverse reactions are extremely rare.[34] However, similar to any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective.[35]\n\nIndividuals with compromised immune systems (e.g., HIV-infection, chemotherapy, combined immunodeficiencies) typically should not receive live-attenuated vaccines as they may not be able to produce an adequate and safe immune response.[36][37][38][39] Household contacts of immunodeficient individuals are still able to receive most attenuated vaccines since there is no increased risk of infection transmission, with the exception being the oral polio vaccine.[40]\n\nAs precaution, live-attenuated vaccines are not typically administered during pregnancy.[41][42] This is due to the risk of transmission of virus between mother and fetus.[43] In particular, the varicella and yellow fever vaccines have been shown to have adverse effects on fetuses and nursing babies.[44]\n\nSome live attenuated vaccines have additional common, mild adverse effects due to their administration route.[45] For example, the live attenuated influenza vaccine is given nasally and is associated with nasal congestion.[46]\n\nCompared to inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines are more prone to immunization errors as they must be kept under strict conditions during the cold chain and carefully prepared (e.g., during reconstitution).[47][48][49]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of vaccine development started with the creation of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century.[50] Jenner discovered that inoculating a human with an animal pox virus would grant immunity against smallpox, a disease considered to be one of the most devastating in human history.[51][52] Although the original smallpox vaccine is sometimes considered to be an attenuated vaccine due to its live nature, it was not strictly-speaking attenuated since it was not derived directly from smallpox. Instead, it was based on the related and milder cowpox disease.[53][54] The discovery that diseases could be artificially attenuated came in the late 19th century when Louis Pasteur was able to derive an attenuated strain of chicken cholera.[55] Pasteur applied this knowledge to develop an attenuated anthrax vaccine and demonstrating its effectiveness in a public experiment.[56] The first rabies vaccine was subsequently produced by Pasteur and Emile Roux by growing the virus in rabbits and drying the affected nervous tissue.[57]\n\nThe technique of cultivating a virus repeatedly in artificial media and isolating less virulent strains was pioneered in the early 20th century by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin who developed an attenuated tuberculosis vaccine called the BCG vaccine.[58] This technique was later used by several teams when developing the vaccine for yellow fever, first by Sellards and Laigret, and then by Theiler and Smith.[59][60][61] The vaccine developed by Theiler and Smith proved to be hugely successful and helped establish recommended practices and regulations for many other vaccines. These include the growth of viruses in primary tissue culture (e.g., chick embryos), as opposed to animals, and the use of the seed stock system which uses the original attenuated viruses as opposed to derived viruses (done to reduce variance in vaccine development and decrease the chance of adverse effects).[62][63] The middle of the 20th century saw the work of many prominent virologists including Sabin, Hilleman, and Enders, and the introduction of several successful attenuated vaccines, such as those against polio, measles, mumps, and rubella.[64][65][66][67]\n\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nAdvantages\n\n-   Accurately imitate natural infections.[68][69]\n-   Are effective at evoking both strong antibody and cell-mediated immune reactions.[70][71][72]\n-   Can elicit long-lasting or life-long immunity.[73][74][75]\n-   Often only one or two doses are required.[76][77][78]\n-   Quick immunity onset.[79][80][81]\n-   Cost-effective (compared to some other health interventions).[82][83]\n-   Can have strong beneficial non-specific effects.[84]\n\nDisadvantages\n\n-   In extremely rare cases natural mutations can cause a virus to revert to its wild-type form or mutate to a new strain, potentially resulting in the new virus being infectious, pathogenic, or dangerous.[85][86]\n-   Often not recommended for immunocompromised patients due to the risk of potentially severe complications.[87][88][89]\n-   Live strains typically require advanced maintenance, such as refrigeration and fresh media, making transport to remote areas difficult and costly.[90][91]\n\n\nList of attenuated vaccines\n\nCurrently in-use\n\nBacterial vaccines\n\n-   Anthrax vaccine[92]\n-   Cholera vaccine[93]\n-   Plague vaccine[94]\n-   Salmonella vaccine[95]\n-   Tuberculosis vaccine[96]\n-   Typhoid vaccine[97]\n\nViral vaccines\n\n-   Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)[98]\n-   Japanese encephalitis vaccine[99]\n-   Measles vaccine[100]\n-   Mumps vaccine[101]\n-   MR vaccine[102]\n-   MMR vaccine[103]\n-   MMRV vaccine[104]\n-   Polio vaccine[105]\n-   Rotavirus vaccine[106]\n-   Rubella vaccine[107]\n-   Smallpox vaccine[108]\n-   Varicella vaccine[109]\n-   Yellow fever vaccine[110]\n-   Zoster/Shingles vaccine[111]\n\nIn development\n\nBacterial vaccines\n\n-   Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli vaccine[112]\n\nViral vaccines\n\n-   Tick-Borne encephalitis vaccine[113]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3]  Vaccines|url=https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/types%7Caccess-date=2020-11-16%7Cwebsite=www.vaccines.gov}}\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35]  CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/history/index.html%7Caccess-date=2020-11-16%7Cwebsite=www.cdc.gov%7Clanguage=en-us}}\n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n\n[47] \n\n[48] \n\n[49] \n\n[50] \n\n[51] \n\n[52] \n\n[53] \n\n[54] \n\n[55] \n\n[56] \n\n[57] \n\n[58] \n\n[59] \n\n[60] \n\n[61] \n\n[62] \n\n[63] \n\n[64] \n\n[65] \n\n[66] \n\n[67] \n\n[68] \n\n[69] \n\n[70] \n\n[71] \n\n[72] \n\n[73] \n\n[74] \n\n[75] \n\n[76] \n\n[77] \n\n[78] \n\n[79] \n\n[80] \n\n[81] \n\n[82] \n\n[83] \n\n[84] \n\n[85] \n\n[86] \n\n[87] \n\n[88] \n\n[89] \n\n[90] \n\n[91] \n\n[92] \n\n[93] \n\n[94] \n\n[95] \n\n[96] \n\n[97] \n\n[98] \n\n[99] \n\n[100] \n\n[101] \n\n[102] \n\n[103] \n\n[104] \n\n[105] \n\n[106] \n\n[107] \n\n[108] \n\n[109] \n\n[110] \n\n[111] \n\n[112] \n\n[113] \n",

    "passage": "Clinging to Kayaks\n\n*Clinging to Kayaks is a project that I experimented with a bit. The term flash fiction has been thrown around me a lot lately. I enjoy the idea of brief bits of stories. CtK takes one paragraph stories and strings them together into a collection. Originally I wrote these (and others I did not include here) with no cohesive order and they are posted like that on my blog. I decided arranging them together would be nice for my first post here. Let me know if I inadvertently broke any rules!*\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.1.\n\n\nThe paper airplane had a note written on it. It was intended to help someone worse off than myself. Uplifting and hopeful it was sent flying out the 52nd story window where my office sat. I watched it spiral out of sight into the masses below. I knew nobody would catch it. That it would be trampled under the hundreds of hurried feet, unnoticed, unread, uncared for. Sighing I sharpened another pencil and pulled another blank sheet towards me. Then I clicked “next” on his computer screen, wondering what airplane design #143 looked like.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.2.\n\n\nYou say you hate the colour brown. I promise not to wear my favourite shirt around you. But I was joking. You didn't get it and probably never will and in all honesty it was a bad joke. You run when things get serious and are afraid of getting close to someone. I'm afraid I'll never get close to anyone. Maybe that's why you ran from me. At first I joked about Pulp Fiction and your tongue piercing. You had never watched it and didn't get that joke either. I realized that I wasn't a comedian of any sorts and asked if you wanted to watch it together. Plans were made. The plans fell through. I imagined you on a road in ragged clothes like Forrest Gump running away from me. I deleted your number after that.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.3.\n\n\nI looked up the distance to your house. 147.3 miles. Satellite images showed your little red car and backyard pool. You had invited me swimming one night. It was late. Even though it was hot and I felt like swimming I declined. You begged me to come. Promised me a great time. I quickly told you goodnight and exited the chat window. Instead I got wicked drunk, telling myself I could always go in the morning. That’s how it was for me. Always the next morning. Always the chat window, the alcohol, and the next morning.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.4.\n\n\nI feel the days like slow techno beats. Each morning I take an eraser to the whiteboard and refresh the countdown. Ninety days were forever, three months just an abstract. Habits formed and time ticked away. It didn't even occur to me when I hit thirty-three. But twenty got my attention. Then single digits came and the whiteboard became the center of my universe. A monk's dedication was nothing compared to my daily diligence. Large, bold, blue numbers announcing to my dining room your arrival. Tomorrow is three and each day drops heavy in my mind. I hope that when you draw zero we can change the beat.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.5.\n\n\nI had no idea what you were saying. Likewise you couldn't understand me in the slightest. Instead of a barrier it became a game. Each of us laughing at the others failed attempts at communication. When words failed we used our hands, tracing our thoughts until smiles erupted on each of our faces. As I kissed you the smiles traveled from our lips to our eyes, locking them together. And as your arms wrapped around me I knew I was in over my head.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.6.\n\n\nYou poured sugar in my coffee just to see my reaction. $1.40 later I was black and bitter again. You told me my life needed to shine more and you didn't understand why I was never happy in the morning. You grabbed another sugar packet and I growled. I didn't understand why you couldn't just let me wake up experiencing the worst part of my day, knowing that it was over by the time I started work, with your smile to look forward to by the time I came home.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.7.\n\n\nWe sat on leather seats and let the radio blend with the raindrops. Both were a background to our soft conversation. We talked about stars and no stars and lights and no lights. We didn't mention darkness, just the absence of light. We talked like the darkness was temporary, as if it was only a matter of time before the light would return. We had confidence in this and confidence in ourselves. Arms were intertwined and I could feel your chest rising and falling against mine. Together we watched the world spin through the rain streaked window, letting the morning sun brighten everything. Just like we knew it would.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.8.\n\n\nWe sit silent as these nights start to come earlier and the temperature drops more than the night before. Your depression worsens with each snowfall. You have always been desperate for the warmth of spring. I watch the thermometer with heightened anticipation. Every lost degree is another chance to pull you closer to me. I love the cold simply because it keeps you around. I know as soon as the sun reappears again I will lose you, gone to the distant hills. Yet for now your wanderlust is frozen. You are mine for the duration.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.9.\n\n\nI found a camera that shows the future when I look through it upside down. My pack of cigarettes is crumpled and short seven or eight. The last few I’m sure are crooked and bent. I pull one out and discover I’m right. It’s nothing but sad. But smoke is smoke and I hang upside down letting it drift past my toes as I look at you through the lens. You twirl and spin for me. Your hair is let down and you are smiling. I think about what we’d see if you tried the camera on me. Perhaps a new pack of cigarettes. Or a clean shirt for a change. I figure that if in the future you are smiling then those things are definitely within reason. Regardless, we definitely have a long way to go from here.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.10.\n\n\nI came home to find you in my room. You were rearranging my bookcase, ordering all the books from sad to happy which resulted in no distinct order at all. You knew I was going to read them all sooner or later and wanted me to finish with a sense of happiness. Pulling one off the shelf at random I began to read. You were upset. “That’s longing turning to fulfillment! You have to start with empty and lost!” You thrust another book into my hands from the bottom of the bookcase. I told you that I was already lost and I wanted fulfillment. You asked if I was longing. I thought it was obvious. Neither of us realized that none of the books could fix us.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.11.\n\n\nThe television became an awkward bystander as you started yelling. Its flickering screen flashing on our faces. I stayed quiet. You wanted to know how I planned on fixing this. You didn't understand that I was silent because I had no answer. I looked around the room and let your words wash over me. The clock in the corner glowed in bold red. The computer had small blinking white lights everywhere. All of these lights kept glowing even though tomorrow was a mystery. You wanted to pull the plug on us for the same reason. Uncertainty was killing you, yet it didn't matter at all to the lights. The clock ticked over to eleven after eleven. And as you slammed the door I wished for you.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.12.\n\n\nYou asked me what I knew about it at all. You said that I had never been in your position. That I had never been at the bottom. You screamed that I could never understand. Silent under your attack I smiled softly. You were furious. In your mind I was judgmental and condescending. In your mind I was an alien to this world. You finally paused for a moment and asked if I had anything to say. I didn’t. I just showed you my wrist and walked away.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.13.\n\n\nThe crushed cans and spinning room was not the only scar you left me with as the door slammed shut behind you. All of those whispers in the dark, making plans and pathways to dreams that were eagerly shattered. Our world was full of hope and I thought nothing could ever change that. I learned that you loved to imagine love and that I was not enough. You told me to forget and never dwell. The way you held me so tight made me believe you were lying. That was when I finally realized that humans were the monsters hiding underneath our beds.\n\nClinging to Kayaks.14\n\n\nI drank for forty-eight hours straight and never threw-up. I considered that an achievement. I didn't consider the girl in bed with me an achievement. I don't remember half of what I said that night. Everyone else was proud of me though. They were impressed. Maybe. I lost my sandals that night. The next morning we cleaned and filled three full sized garbage bags with cans. None of them were mine. I threw my two empty glass bottles into the back of the truck. I almost threw them in the lake, just to watch them in the water. They chimed as they collided in the truck bed and my head hurt with the sound. I noticed then that the sun was too bright and the world too loud. My head spun and I laughed at myself. I gripped the edge of the sink, stared straight into my eyes in the mirror, and laughed at myself. They asked if I was okay with strange tones and then left me alone. I never did find my sandals.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.15.\n\n\nThey say if it’s meant to be you will come back. I stare at the sky and wonder what it feels like to be swallowed. By a mouth, by the sky, by time. I mark the spot I lost you and wait for the clock to tick back to the exact moment. My neck begins to ache from staring up after you for so long. But the universe is just too big and the clock never reverses direction. They say if it’s meant to be you will come back. I think they really mean that you were meant to be far away from me.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.16.\n\n\nSometimes I stare into the dark just to see you. When the sun is gone and the stars are hiding too I can feel you. They say at night to look just to the side of the object you want to look at. It has something to do with the rods and cones in your eyes they said. Sometimes I stare right at you. Sometimes I stare to your left. Sometimes I stare to your right. I never really find you. But I know you are there, just as the stars are there. I ask you to come closer. I ask you why the sky is dark at night if the universe is filled with hidden stars. You leave me to figure it out by myself which is the best way to learn. I take lessons on astronomy and how to strengthen my night vision. I whisper what I learn to you. Every time I step closer to you I know that you step back. I really want to see you. But I think you know that.\n\n\nClinging to Kayaks.17.\n\n\nI said the sunset was cotton candy and you laughed at that. The water beneath us looked cold and what I imagined death might be like. Somewhere in the distance someone was frantic. There were sirens. You unscrewed one of the supports of the dock which brought it closer to the water. You said you felt sorry for the dock. All the boats led exciting lives. Even docks wanted to see the world. I just nodded and tossed an anchor into the water, tying the other end of the line tight to the slats we stood on. You had moved on to the third support with your screwdriver by then. As the sirens faded I said the sunset was cotton candy and you asked me if I knew how to swim.\n\n\n-Ryan Avery",

    "passage": "My buddy Jordan has been writing short stories. Here's one of them!\n\nBefore I tell you this story, please, understand that I am NOT crazy. I swear. I've lived a completely normal life until this school year. I don't know who to go to for advice; I'm sure I'll get locked in an asylum. These past events have made me lose sleep, focus, and sanity.\n\tIt all began on the first day of school. Normally I would be ecstatic to return to school. That day, I was completely excited. I had been in my room everyday of the summer, hoping to improve my orchestral skill. I studied each and every note of my favorite movements carefully, reading each bar with great concentration. I play any music, from classical to modern music, and while I can honestly say I enjoy it, I feel like I can never improve. Last year, we had a very high strung woman conduct us. Ms. Gibbens never seemed to give us good advice, and was always on the edge when the quarter-annual concerts would swing around. Despite all of her flaws, I came to like her, because what she couldn't express through words without stuttering, she could play through music beautifully. Each note was pure and graceful, connecting her spirit with sound. I would always look forward to Orchestra class, until May 14th. On May 14th, Ms. Gibbens didn't show up to class, and we were all seated, ready to play our instruments. A few minutes after the morning announcements, people began to lose concentration. Jokes were made about Ms. Gibbens, people would say: \"She has to feed her cats, she's too old for real company\", or \"Maybe she couldn't handle the stress of teaching anymore\". Students were laughing and enjoying themselves. After all, Ms. Gibbens had not shown up, and it had been well over 20 minutes. After a few more minutes of complete chaos, the principal frantically opened the room door, with a face as pale as the Alps in the winter. \n\"K-k-kids, you can pack up your instruments. There's been a terrible accident.\" he stuttered, still in obvious shock.\n Many students began to converse as they packed up their cases, wondering what happened. I was still in my chair, desperately hoping that Ms. Gibbens would be okay. After a few questions, the principal finally came to tell  me that Ms. Gibbens had committed suicide. I felt sick all of the sudden, and requested to go home. I can't remember the next few days of my life during that period. The feeling of losing someone you deeply care about is unlike any other. I dealt with it the only way I knew how to: music. I played my heart out each day, crying after every session, wishing I could turn back the hands of time, or just say good-bye to Ms. Gibbens. Near the end of the year, I started to slowly become myself again, and I decided that I would devote my life to music, to honor Ms. Gibbens. \n\tFast forward 5 months of practicing, and there I was, in orchestra class once again. The entire room had been renovated, and the chairs and stands were brand new. The teacher that had been selected was said to be one of the best in the area, and a few students even claimed they had been taught by him before. Keep in mind, I'm not a judgmental person. I've lived a life of solitude for the past 5 months, so pointing out flaws is something I'm not entirely comfortable doing. But this teacher, man, he was a wreck. He was wearing a wrinkled blue collar-up shirt, stained black slacks, and his hair was a sloppy combover. He smelled like he had just ran around the school track more times than the entire football team had in their lives. \n\"Hey guys, my name is Mr. Broadfoot!\" he said with great excitement.\nWhat an odd name for a teacher. It sounds very familiar. I think I may have had him as a teacher too. He looks a hell of a lot different, though, I thought to myself.\n \"I know that you've all had a fair share of sadness this past year, but remember, music can do great things for a person!\" he exclaimed, his excitement even more present than earlier. \n\tI began to quickly feel anger towards him. Who was he to bring up the death of Ms. Gibbens? He didn't know her like we did. Many kids began uncomfortably shifting in their chairs, and he narrowed his eyes. \n\"Look, I'm not going to spoon-feed you guys. You're all old enough to get your shit together, right?\" he growled, his tone severly dropping.\n\tI felt even more anger towards him, and as I played that day, all I could think about was about that anger. This jerk doesn't deserve to take this place, I thought. However, my anger slowly subsided, as he grew more and more stern throughout the session. I couldn't tell what it was, but something seemed off about him. I felt intimidated. I quickly shrugged it off that day, and was glad to leave the room. I left school afterwards, because I only have orchestra and P.E. on mondays, and I wasn't going to go to P.E. with a lousy attitude.\n\tAs I walked down the hallway, I could feel people staring at me. Their eyes burning into me. I couldn't blame them though, as I probably looked like a wreck too. I had been so focused on music that I hadn't seen anyone in months. I just shrugged it off, like usual. Why should I care about people's opinions? After all, I'm my own person. They have no right to judge me. Music can do great things for a person.\n\tThe next day, I woke up, grabbed a quick bite of breakfast, and stopped by Starbuck's for a quick coffee. Mr. Broadfoot started off the day ecstatic as usual, but gradually became more stern. Every student was very nervous in that class, and began fidgeting and even a few cried. I felt anger again that day too, but I was still spooked by Mr. Broadfoot's presence.\n \tIf only I knew what it was about him; he seems so familiar, I thought, trying to probe my mind for possible answers.\n\tAs I walked to math class, I could feel even more students glaring at me. I was confused, but still neglected them. I just shrugged it off. As I sat down in a desk in math class, the teacher looked at me oddly, but didn't say anything. I returned a concerned glance, and she simply nodded and began classroom expectations. I was so tired, despite the coffee I had drank prior to arriving at school. I began to slowly doze off.....\n\tThe math teacher, Mrs. Alan, prodded me with a ruler. I woke up, startled.\n\t\"What time is it?\" I frantically asked, embarrased.\n\t\"About 11:30. You were asleep for 3 hours. Is everything okay, Trevor?\" she asked, her voice filled with concern and confusion.\n\t\"Yeah, I guess I just couldn't sleep well last night. Sorry to bother you!\" I said, quickly leaving the classroom.\n\tThis is where things start to really fall off. Please remember, I'm not crazy. \n\tI woke up that morning, and did the usual routine, a bite of breakfast, and some Starbuck's. I felt ready to play music that day. As I entered the Orchestra room, EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE began whispering and staring at me. The sheer power of an entire room looking at me was so immense, that I couldn't look back. I slowly made my way to my seat. As I sat down, I could still feel people staring at me. At that moment, I was so fed up with it. I quickly snapped around and yelled:\n\t\"What the hell do you guys want?!\"\n\tA few students flinched, and some became angry. I quickly felt regret for yelling at them. \n\t\"Well, are you going to conduct or not?\" a student yelled.\n\tI froze in confusion. Why would they want me to conduct? At that moment, I realized Mr. Broadfoot had not shown up to class that day. I shrugged it off and began to conduct. About halfway through the class period, I realized Mr. Broadfoot was not going to show up. I scoffed. \n\tJust like an ass, to not show up for his students, I thought.\n\tI reached to pick up my cup of coffee, and spilled it all over my black slacks. The combination of frustration and pain surged through me and I stormed off to the bathroom. As I cleaned myself up, I looked in the mirror. What I saw in the mirror will haunt me forever. I saw myself in the mirror, with a sloppy combover, with a wrinkled collar-up blue shirt, and stained black slacks. \n\tAt that moment, I began to cry. I was so distraught and confused. I couldn't think straight. How the hell did this happen? No, this can't be real. It can't be. I'm dreaming. I'll wake up to my regular morning routine and everything will be right again.\n\tI ran as fast as I could to Mrs. Alan's room. I had to find someone who actually cared about me. As she saw me approaching her nose wrinkled in disgust. I couldn't blame her. \n\t\"What do you need, Mr. Broadfoot?\" she asked sternly.\n\t\"I... I don't know who I am anymore.\" I said with confusion.\n\t\"You need to go see a counselor. First you come into my room and sleep, and now you verbally abuse your students? If I had the power to, I'd fire you right now. Leave my room.\" she retorted.\n\tI met with my therapist, and he diagnosed me with a split-personality. It turns out that last year, I was a college grad, and I was the student teacher in Ms. Gibbins' class. Part of me wanted to cling onto the past so much, that I remained a student partly. However, I had to take up teaching the class to finish my credit hours. I hated myself for trying to fill her place as an orchestra teacher. I began to live two lives, one as the student, and one as the teacher. Despite the huge differences, we were both Trevor Broadfoot. \n\tRight now, I'm writing this letter because I've decided I don't want to live anymore. I've lost everything. My family refuses to meet with a mentally insane person, every student hates me, and I hate myself equally. I'm raising the gun to my head. Wait.. I can hear the music. The music I studied all summer. It's calling for me to stop. To press on and get help. No. It's too late. I'll just shrug it off.\nInspired by Mr. Hale- the biggest asshole orchestra teacher ever",

    "passage": "Kickapoo State Recreation Area\n\nKICKAPOO STATE RECREATION AREA is an Illinois state park on in Vermilion County, Illinois, United States. Located between Oakwood, Illinois and Danville, Illinois, this park is easily accessible through route I-74. It is away from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and from Indianapolis. According to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the name Kickapoo originated from the Kickapoo village that once existed near the junction of the Salt Fork and Middle Fork branches of the Vermilion River. After Europeans settled in the area and displaced the Native Americans, the Europeans began to dig wells to harvest salt from salt springs, called salines.[1] In the early 20th century the land was then strip-mined for coal. Kickapoo State Park was the first park in the United States to be located on strip-mined land.[2] The state of Illinois purchased the Kickapoo State Park Area in 1939 with donation money from Danville residents and the land has since recovered from the extraction of these resources.[3]\n\nToday, Kickapoo State Park has of ponds and lakes with nearly of hiking trails for many types of recreational activities including camping, canoeing, hunting, mountain biking, and fishing.[4] In the winter season, ice fishing and cross-country skiing are popular pastimes for visitors to the park. Campsites are available year-round with RV and electric hookups available. There are 22 deep water ponds which are accessible to electric motor boats, canoes, and kayaks. Visitors to the park may rent a canoe or kayak to paddle down the Vermilion River, which runs through the center Kickapoo State Park. Scuba diving is also allowed within the park.[5]\n\n\nHistory\n\n[Allhands Cemetery, located in the southeast corner of Kickapoo State Park, is the final resting place for many early European settlers from the early 20th century.]\n\nNative American History 500-1500\n\nAccording to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, archaeological evidence indicates the existence of a village inhabited by Native Americans of the Woodland and Mississippian cultures somewhere between 500 and 1500. This village was located at the junction of the Middle Fork and Salt Fork Rivers. The village was home to Kennekuk, a Native American known as the “Kickapoo Prophet,” who brokered many treaties between the European settlers and Native Americans. Kennekuk was a proponent of a new form of Christianity that had elements of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.[6] The Native Americans lived in the area which is now Kickapoo State Park until sometime during the 16th century.\n\nSalt Production 1819-1848\n\nEuropeans were drawn to what is now the Kickapoo State Recreation Area with the discovery of salt springs in 1819.[7] Most of the immigrants to this area were English.[8] After the Europeans settled in the area, they began to dig wells all over the land. From these wells they harvested salt brine and boiled it down to produce salt. This salt operation continued until 1848, producing as much as 120 bushels of salt per week during the peak of its production process.[9] One of the iron rendering kettles used in the production process can be seen at the Salt Kettle Rest area on I-74.[10] Many European settlers from the early 20th century are buried in Allhands Cemetery, which is located in the eastern section of the park. Other settlers such as John Cox, an Indian fighter and scout in the Black Hawk War,[11] and his wife are buried at the entrance to Fox Campground in a small pioneer cemetery.\n\nCoal Strip-Mining 1850-1940\n\nBetween 1850 and 1940 the park area was strip-mined for coal, leaving many mine pits and spoil piles.[12] The mine in Kickapoo State Park was one of the first in the country to use mechanization for strip-mining.[13] Over the years these mine pits have filled with water and become lakes and barren areas have been largely reforested.\n\n1940-Present\n\n[Entrance sign to Kickapoo State Recreation Area] The state of Illinois initially purchased 1,290 acres of land from the United Electric Coal Company in 1939 and added additional area to the park in subsequent years.[14] Clint C. Tilton, a local newspaper owner and historian, began the drive that brought this park to Vermilion County.[15] Since then the park has gradually recovered from the mine pits and spoil piles left behind from the strip-mining process.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, a shortage in the state budget of $2 billion led to the threat of park closure.[16] The state was planning to close 11 parks on November 1, including Kickapoo State Park, to help meet its budget. Kelley Quinn, a spokeswoman from former Governor Rod Blagojevich's office, said “[p]arks are closing across the country; people are being laid off...[you] have to consider the national economy. The national economy is part of...[why we must close the park].” [17] The decision to close the park was met with much resistance. More than 300 protesters, made up of a conglomeration of local Danville residents and University of Illinois students, met at Kickapoo in late August 2008 to protest its closure.[18] Due to the protests, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich decided to allow Kickapoo to remain open while 7 other state parks were closed. In celebration of the park remaining open, a cleanup day of Kickapoo was scheduled on April 25, 2009.[19] Volunteers were provided with the equipment necessary to remove litter from campsites and lakes. Since then there have been many cleanup efforts by local residents.[20]\n\n\nPlant and Animal Species\n\nKickapoo State Recreation Area is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species. Middle Fork Woods Nature Preserve is located within Kickapoo State Park and is the only known location of the silvery salamander in Illinois.[21] This nature preserve of 69.2 acres [22] is home to many different tree species including white and black oak, hickory, blue beech, sugar maple, basswood, ironwood, redbud, and sassafras. Cypress trees have been planted along pond edges while strip mine banks have been naturally covered by cottonwood and ash trees.[23] This variety of hardwood species colors the park in the fall season and attracts many visitors. In the springtime, a variety of wildflowers can also be seen including: violets, bluebells, spring beauties, Dutchman's-breeches, and nodding trilliums.[24]\n\nOf the 100 different bird species spotted within the park,[25] the belted kingfisher, pileated woodpecker, red-winged blackbird, great blue heron, and least bittern are the most commonly seen. A birding checklist is available at the park office. In addition to the multitude of bird species spotted within the park, there are also a variety of mammals including white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, cottontail rabbits, and muskrats.[26]\n\n\nRecreational Activities\n\nCamping\n\nBetween the two campgrounds within the park there are 184 sites available for tent camping and trailer camping.[27] Reservations can be made at online at Reserve America, however there are a number of walk-in sites for back country tent campers. The maximum length of stay is 14 days within a 30-day period. Almost half of the sites have electric hookups and there are two shower houses which are open from May 1 through November 1.[28] Note that campers staying at sites with electric hookups must pay for the availability of electricity even if it is never used. Campers must also have their own camping equipment as well as their camping permit before entering the campgrounds.[29]\n\nFishing\n\n[Two fishermen on the Vermilion River near the entrance to the Kickapoo State Park.]\n\nThere are many fish species found within the park's 22 ponds and the Vermilion River. Some of the most common catches by fishermen are largemouth and smallmouth bass, catfish, bluegill, crappie, and redear sunfish according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Rainbow trout is another popular fish species to catch in the fall and spring months when the lakes are stocked.[30]\n\nBoating\n\nFor boating activities, there are 12 launching ramps on 9 of the lakes in Kickapoo State Park although only electric motors are allowed on these lakes.[31] Kickapoo Adventures, previously known as Kickapoo Landing, is a concession place within the park offering canoe, paddle board, tube, and kayak rentals, shuttle services to parts of the Middle Fork of the Vermilion River, bait, firewood, and a restaurant for visitors to enjoy.[32][33] Visitors may rent boats by the hour for use on Clear Lake within the park, or sign up for a trip down the Middle Fork of the Vermilion River with a canoe, kayak, or inner tube. The tube trip is 2 miles long starting at Sportsman's Lake and ending in the state park. For visitors wishing to partake in kayaking or canoeing activities down the river they may choose between a 13-mile trip beginning at Kinny's Ford, an 8-mile trip starting at Bunker Hill, or a combination of 2 miles on the Vermilion River and paddling through 3 lakes in the park.[34] In addition to rental services, Kickapoo Adventures sells fishing licenses, tackle, and an assortment of worms for bait. The concession also has live music at the dockside cafe Tuesday and Friday nights all summer long.[35]\n\nHiking\n\n[Trail in Kickapoo State Park near High Pond]\n\nThere are 7 marked hiking trails within Kickapoo State Recreation Area. One of the more challenging trails is the 7.6-mile Out and Back running trail [36] which winds through forest and edges of cropland. The Out and Back trail is also the longest trail in the park and runs from the group camp area across the Johnson Hill Bridge. However, the Johnson Hill Bridge was demolished in 2006, significantly limiting the length of this trail.[37] The Mountain Bike Trail is a 6.5-mile trail which circles Stump Pond and is located in the northeastern corner of the park. Some of the other shorter trails are: Clear Lake Trail (3 miles), Nature Trail (0.75 miles), High Lake Trail (1.5 miles), Riverview Trail (2.0 miles), and Brian Plawer Nature Trail (0.9 miles). High Lake Trail also has a 0.2-mile portion which is ADA accessible.[38]\n\nMountain Biking\n\nOver 200 acres have been allocated for mountain bike use in the park.[39] There are 11 mountain biking routes in this area, ranging from easy to difficult, located in the northeast section of Kickapoo State Park.[40] Some of the more difficult trails have 1–2 foot jumps, steep inclines, switchbacks, and benchcut ravines. The bike trails wind through the forest, abandoned strip mine area, and along the Vermilion River. Mountain bike trails are open for visitors to use year-round, although they close during the annual fall firearm hunting seasons (usually falling on 2 to 4 weekends in November and December), and occasionally due to extended muddy conditions such as the spring thaw or damage following heavy storms.[41]\n\nHunting\n\nRegistered hunters (using firearms or bows) are allowed to hunt white-tailed deer, cock pheasant, rabbit, and squirrels in the park twice a year.[42] There are over 1,000 acres of land for hunters to use each fall.[43] Trap and archery ranges are available to visitors to Kickapoo State Park as well.\n\nOther\n\nOther recreational activities at Kickapoo State Recreation Area include cross-country skiing and scuba diving, and is one of the few state parks in Illinois that allows scuba diving. Certified divers may explore the depths of Inland Sea and Sportsman's Lake.[44] A company by the name of Thunder Wolf Trail Rides used to offer horseback riding lessons, trail rides, hay rides, and birthday parties in the park area but it closed in 2015.[45][46]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n",

Its most powerful attack is a large laser beam that can instantly destroy anything within its radius.\n\nPursuit Mode\n\nPURSUIT MODE (高速フォーム _Kōsoku Fōmu_, \"High-speed Form\") is the second form used. In this form, the Great Sacred Treasure shifts into a slimmer appearance, equipped with a Gatling turret capable of firing powerful lasers, as well as rapid fire bullets.\n\nMech Armor Mode\n\nMECH ARMOR MODE (格闘フォーム _Kakutō Fōmu_, \"Fighting Form\") is the third form used. In this form, the Great Sacred Treasure shifts into a more humanoid appearance, gaining arms and legs. It fires projectiles from the five points on its golden insignia.\n\nAfter Hades detaches the top half of the Great Sacred Treasure from the bottom half, the Mech Armor form gains a new weapon in the form of a long, blue energy blade, which Pit then uses to slice Hades in half.\n\nUltralight Mode\n\nULTRALIGHT MODE (飛翔フォーム _Hishō Fōmu_, \"Flying Form\") is the fourth form used. Appearing as half of the previous form but with golden wings, this form is incredibly nimble. It can rapidly shoot green energy beams from its palms, as well as launch powerful waves.\n\nFinal Strike\n\nThe FINAL STRIKE (最後の一撃 _Saigonoichigeki_, \"Final Straw\") is all that remains of the Great Sacred Treasure after it is destroyed by Hades, with its only usable component being a single cannon. Fueled by Palutena's divine power, it fires a large laser powerful enough to destroy Hades's physical form.\n\n\nAppearances\n\nChapter 24: The Three Trials\n\nAfter the Three Sacred Treasures have been destroyed, Pit and Palutena seek out Dyntos to create a new weapon for them. However, Dyntos is reluctant to help, forcing Pit to participate in three trials to prove himself worthy first.\n\nFor Pit's final trial, Dyntos forces him to fight the Great Sacred Treasure, which proves to be an admirable foe. After its defeat, Pit begins piloting the Great Sacred Treasure, eagerly zipping around the room until he crashes it into the ground.\n\nChapter 25: The War's End\n\nThe Great Sacred Treasure enables Pit to keep up with Hades for their final battle together, switching forms and adapting to everything that Hades throws at the angel.\n\nHowever, Hades destroys the treasure in a single clap, sending Pit plummeting to the Overworld. Viridi then grants Pit the Power of Flight while Palutena charges the remaining cannon of the Great Sacred Treasure, which they use to defeat Hades once and for all.\n\n\nBattle Style\n\nDespite being quite the sizeable mech, the Great Sacred Treasure is as nimble as it is powerful. It is capable of shooting a wide range of projectiles, summoning whirlwinds, charging full speed at its foe, inflicting a multitude of Status Ailments, and dodging predictable attacks by rolling or teleporting away.\n\nUpon taking enough damage, the Great Sacred Treasure's strategy will change. Not only will it use its former moves, but it will also charge a massive beam that destroys half of the battlefield and instantly kills anything caught in the blast. In addition, it can also summon an orb that will gravitate its opponent toward the center of the stage, as well as fire huge laser beams.\n\n\nIdol Descriptions\n\nGreat Sacred Treasure\n\n_The Great Sacred Treasure was designed by Dyntos to be the ultimate weapon. Used in the final battle against Hades, the weapon is huge and incredibly powerful, yet can stop on a dime and change its form to adapt to damage._\n\nGreat Sacred Treasure (Pursuit)\n\n_As Hades rushes to the surface world to refuel on souls, the Great Sacred Treasure jettisons its heaviest parts and enters the high-speed Pursuit Mode. Equipped with a gatling turret, its guns can fire both bullets and ring lasers._\n\nGreat Sacred Treasure (Mech Armor)\n\n_Shedding even more parts from Pursuit Mode, the Great Sacred Treasure takes a humanoid form. This versatile mode doesn't require any specialized controls; it actually moves as if it were an extension of the user's own body!_\n\nGreat Sacred Treasure (Ultralight)\n\n_The Great Sacred Treasure abandons all but its most necessary parts to enter this super-mobile mode. While it can keep up with Hades, the god of the Underworld destroys it with a single clap, leaving only its cannon behind._\n\nFinal Strike\n\n_When the Great Sacred Treasure is destroyed by Hades, the main cannon loses power, requiring Palutena to concentrate on using her divine power to restore its energy. Luckily, Viridi steps in to keep Pit flying!_\n\n\nGallery\n\n[Great Sacred Treasure Pursuit]\n\nArtwork of the Great Sacred Treasure's Pursuit Mode.\n\n[Greatsacredtreasurearcard]\n\n[Greatsacredtreasurepursuitarcard]\n\n[Greatsacredtreasuremecharmorarcard]\n\n[Greatsacredtreasureultralightarcard]\n\n[Finalstrikearcard]\n\n[Greatsacredtreasurescreencap1]\n\nThe Great Sacred Treasure, engaging Pit in battle in Chapter 24.\n\n[Pitgreatsacredtreasure]\n\nPit piloting the Great Sacred Treasure.\n\n[Greatsacredtreasurescreencap2]\n\nThe Great Sacred Treasure's Pursuit Mode in Chapter 25.\n\n[Greatsacredtreasurescreencap3]\n\nThe Great Sacred Treasure's Mech Armor Mode.\n\n[Greatsacredtreasurescreencap4]\n\nThe Great Sacred Treasure's Ultralight Mode.\n\n[Finalstrikescreencap]\n\nThe Final Strike.\n\nAdd a photo to this gallery\n\nEnemies in the _Kid Icarus_ series.\n_KID ICARUS_\nEelEye • Commyloose • Daphne • Eggplant Wizard • Erinus • Ganewmede • Girin • HEWDRAW • Holer • Keepah • Keron • Kobil • Komayto • Mcgoo • MEDUSA • Mick • Minos • Moila • Monoeye • Monolith • Nettler • Octos • PANDORA • Pluton • Pluton Fly • Reaper • Reapette • Rokman • Shemum • Shulm • Snowman • Specknose • Syren • Tamambo • Tanatos • Totem • Tros • TWINBELLOWS • Uranos • Zuree\n_OF MYTHS AND MONSTERS_\nBat • Big Toe • Busy Bee • Cyclops Hopper • Cyclops Skull • Eggplant Wizard • FIRE SERPENT • Fireball • Fuzz Ball • Globe • Gruff • Gubble • King Krab • Komayto • Lunus • Merc • MINOTAUR • Monolith • Octus • ORCOS • Putt • Pythagoras • Reaper • Shadow Mask • SKULL WING • Slime • Snake • Spitball Blob • Spunky • Sticky Talon • Stone Golem • Totem • Wormser\n_UPRISING_\nUNDERWORLD ARMY\nMonoeye • Wave Angler • MEDUSA • Octos • Keron • Gyrazer • Shemum • Nettler • Skuttler • Mik • Ganewmede • Crawler • TWINBELLOWS • Syren • Shrip • Porcuspine • Belunka • Handora • Coral • Boogity • Monolith • Splin • Specknose • Commyloose • Zurret • Shulm • Fire Wyrm • Shildeen • DARK LORD GAOL • Paramush • THREE-HEADED HEWDRAW • Komayto • Daphne • Stackjaw • Monomiknose • Minos • Merenguy • HEWDRAW HEAD • Mega Mussel • Gloomerang • HEWDRAW REBORN • Reaper • Reapette • Shelbo • Zuree • Orne • Tortolunk • Eggplant Wizard • Clubberskull • GREAT REAPER • Magmoo • Bluster • Fort Oink • Girin • Leox • Armin • PANDORA • Petribomber • Snong • Vakloom • Sinistew • Brawny Claws • Snowman • Frozum • Pluton • Zik & Zak • Bumbledrop • THANATOS • Remoblam & Remoblamling • Collin • Phil • Trailtail • Shootfly • UNDERWORLD GATEKEEPER • Igniot • Suit of Skuttler • Tempura Wizard • Erinus • Guttler • AMAZON PANDORA • Cellular Handora • Cellular Bluster • Cellular Monoeye • Cellular Komayto • Cellular Igniot • Cellular Sinistew • Cellular Snong • Cellular Skuttler • Cellular Gyrazer • Cellular Shildeen • HADES'S HEART • HADES\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSPACE PIRATES\nSpace Pirate • Space Pirate Sniper • Space Pirate Commando\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFORCES OF NATURE\nRESET BOMB • Nutski • Trynamite • Zert • Blader • Dibble Dop • Parashooter • Lurchthorn • Pew Pew • Pip • Urgle • Hugworm • Toxiecap • Lethinium • Jitterthug • Boom Stomper • Mahva • CRAGALANCHE • Badoot • Bumpety Bomb • Mudrone • Cacaw • Skreetle • Captain Flare • Meeba • Megonta • Forces of Nature Guard • RESET BOMB POD • Flage • Clobbler • ARLON • PHOSPHORA\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAURUM\nTribyte • Blit • Quoil • Jyok • Claxis • Dohz • Plixo • Kolma • Taklax • Xoneme • Sio • Zaurum • Baglo • Rezda • Zrink • AURUM CORE • Roz • Nukleen • Biota • Aurum Monoeye • Aurum Mik • Aurum Pip • Aurum Fire Wyrm • Aurum Specknose • Aurum Skuttler • Aurum Urgle • Aurum Shemum • AURUM GENERATOR • AURUM BRAIN • AURUM PYRRHON\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPALUTENA'S ARMY\nCenturion • Centurion Knight • Centurion Strongarm • Juggernaut • PIT'S BODY • PALUTENA\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAOS\nCHAOS KIN • Shadow Pit\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUNAFFILIATED\nTreasurefish • Rare Treasurefish • Souflee • Mimicutie • DARK PIT • KRAKEN • PHOENIX • CHARIOT MASTER • SOUL-EATING MONSTER • MAGNUS • PSEUDO-PALUTENA • GREAT SACRED TREASURE\n",

    "passage": "[]\n\n\nThe Internet and social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have democratized elections, made the world more interconnected, and allowed the velocity of information to be faster than ever before. \n\nBut an extensive eight-month investigation by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) released on Monday found these same forces can also be the greatest threat to America’s sovereignty _(visit campaignfundingrisks.com to download the full report)_. These technologies allow foreign donors to anonymously circumvent U.S. campaign finance laws and directly influence elections by donating repeatedly to candidates. \n\nThe 108-page GAI report found nearly half of Congress, both political parties and presidential candidates, and third-party fundraising groups that funnel money to political parties and candidates were vulnerable to fraudulent and foreign donations. This is a bipartisan problem potentially impacting all levels of government, as those whose organizations were found to have been vulnerable include President Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Republican National Committee (RNC), and third-party groups like ActBlue, which funnels money to progressive politicians.  \n\nAnd the report found that the website Obama.com, which is not owned by President Barack Obama’s campaign but redirects to the campaign’s official donation page, may make the Obama campaign the most susceptible to illicit foreign donations. Obama.com is connected to an Obama campaign bundler, Robert Roche, who is from Chicago but now lives and co-founded a corporation in China. Roche has direct ties to China’s state-owned banking industry. \n\nPeter Schweizer, president of GAI, told Breitbart News the ease with which foreigners could donate to American candidates puts America’s sovereignty in peril. \n\n“Foreign donations mean that we no longer make our election decisions anymore,” Schweizer told Breitbart News.\n\nSchweizer said he had initially thought “we would find some bloggers overseas with motivation to support a presidential candidate encouraging people to make donations,” but he was “very surprised” by the study’s findings, including how easy it was for foreigners to use “robo-donation” programs that allow foreigners to potentially make thousands of small-dollar, fraudulent and automated donations to candidates. \n\nSchweizer said he “never thought” the GAI would find mysterious redirect sites like Obama.com and was “surprised how little security is required to receive online donations.”\n\n“We are basically trusting political consultants and fundraisers to do the right thing when no one is looking,” Schweizer said. \n\nThe report found nearly half of Congress was vulnerable to fraudulent and foreign directions. Of the 446 House and Senate members who have an online donation page, 47.3% do not require the Card Verification Value (CVV), which is the three or four-digit security code on the back of credit cards, for internet donations. Those in Congress who are vulnerable to foreign donations can be seen at www.CampaignFundingRisks.com.\n\n“Candidates appear content with lax security, negligently inviting foreign or fraudulent cash into their campaign,” the report notes.\n\nAnd the Obama campaign seems to be the most content with the “lax security.” \n\nThe FEC requires campaigns to make their “best efforts” to collect identifying information on all contributors who donate more than $50.30 and even more specific information, such as the donor’s occupation and employer, for donations over $200. \n\nAs the report notes, donations less than $50, though, fall under the “Pass-the-Hat” rule, which means campaigns can report all such donations under a lump sum and do not have to make their “best efforts” to collecting information on these small-dollar donors. \n\nBecause foreigners can exploit the “Pass-the-Hat” rule, the report  found that “any campaign not using these industry-standard security tools is increasing its costs and unnecessarily increasing the risk of at least two types of potential fraud”:\n\n  The Fraudulent High Dollar Donor(s): -the fraudulent high dollar donor is politically motivated and is seeking to avoid detection by making numerous donations below the $200 dollar threshold, over which their donation must be identified; they may seek to exceed campaign donation limits. \n\n  The Unintentional Fraudster -a foreign national who is unaware of U.S. election laws but sympathetic to the campaign. Such an individual can easily end up on a campaign donation page. Given that a number of campaigns list the U.S. donation laws in an inconspicuous place on the “donate” page, it is easy to see how illegal donations can be made with no malicious intent. \n\nAnd the Obama campaign is most vulnerable to both types of fraudsters. \n\nFor example, the study found “the Obama campaign regularly and aggressively posts solicitations for donations and campaign memorabilia on Facebook,” and “the campaign does not make clear in these postings that only U.S. citizens or permanent residents are allowed to contribute.” Fundraising solicitations from the Obama campaign have gone out to foreigners, asking them to contribute in amounts of less than $200. Similar solicitations have been posted in Arabic, Taiwanese, and Chinese on Facebook and on Middle Eastern and Asian websites. \n\nEven though the Obama campaign is touted for its technological sophistication and sites run by top Obama technology advisers use the “CVV” feature, the Obama campaign itself does not use the “CVV” feature on its donation pages — even though it does use the feature on the merchandise pages where it sells campaign merchandise. \n\nThis means someone who donates $2,500 to the campaign online has to go through less security than someone who goes online to buy an Obama campaign mug. \n\n“This creates a security risk that is compounded by the considerable foreign interest in President Obama’s political history, personal story, and views,” the report notes. \n\nAnd according to the study, BarackObama.com, the campaign’s main website, receives approximately 43% of its traffic from foreign IP addresses.\n\nIn addition, popular websites touting Obama’s campaign and linking to its donation page have been found in places like China, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, Norway, Egypt, Hong Kong, and South Korea.\n\nThe report notes that not using the CVV feature “is quite possibly costing the campaign millions of dollars in additional fees,” but the campaign is still not using it. Perhaps this is so because the Obama campaign has benefited from donations slipping through the cracks in the past. \n\nIn 2008, the report discovered that an individual using the name “Doodad Pro” made at least 791 contributions totaling $19,065 to the Obama campaign while others named “Good Will,” “Test Person” from “Some Place, UT,” “gjtjtjtjtjtjr, AP,” and “QWERTTYYU” also contributed to the campaign. \n\nThe most interesting — or suspicious — site is Obama.com, which the campaign strangely does not own. According to the report, nearly 68% of internet traffic to Obama.com comes from foreign locations. And the website is connected to Robert Roche, who lives in China and co-founded a Chinese company called Acorn International. Roche, the report found, made 19 visits to the White House since 2009, including being seated at the head table during a State dinner with Chinese president Hu Jintao in 2011. \n\nUnlike the Obama campaign, the Romney campaign website uses the “CVV” feature but it is not without vulnerabilities.\n\nFor instance, Romney’s campaign also has Facebook and Twitter accounts in Arabic that give off the impression they are associated with the Romney campaign. These accounts link to the Romney campaign’s page and are presumably for a foreign audience. \n\nIn addition, the report found some of Romney’s top bundlers, like Akin Gump’s Tom Loeffler, have lobbied for foreign governments like Saudi Arabia. \n\nSince 1980, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, the Chinese government, powerful Indonesian families, foreign criminal gangs, and the Turkish government have tried to influence American officials through campaign donations. \n\nTurkish government officials, the report notes, once bragged about sending hundreds of thousands of dollars in “un-itemized contributions” to then Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert’s campaign between 1996 and 2000 and the government of Pakistan has shuttled campaign donations through intermediaries to presidential candidates and members of Congress who sat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, such as Congressman Dan Burton.\n\nWith the internet, foreigners can now attempt to influence American officials anonymously and conveniently — with the click of a mouse. \n\nAccording to the study, influential members of Congress had websites that made them vulnerable to illicit foreign donations. For instance, Rep. Ilena Ros-Lehtinen, Chairman of the House International Affairs Committee, had a campaign website that prior to May 1, 2012 did not require the CVV to contribute to her campaign. Though there was no evidence of illicit campaign contributions, her website was vulnerable to them. \n\nThe study also found that during Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2010 senate run, Rubio’s campaign did not require the CVV from his online contributors and foreign websites, including many in South America, often featured videos that urged viewers to “donate” to Rubio’s campaign. One potential reason for Rubio’s popularity abroad on websites was the idea of “ethnic solidarity” among Hispanics willing to support a rising star of the same heritage. \n\nThe report also noted foreigners can also donate to third-party organizations on both sides of the aisle that funnel money to political candidates.\n\nThe GAI study acknowledged “by design, social media’s expansive and viral nature disseminates information, ideas, and causes,” and as a result, “social media is difficult to control, and indeed should not be controlled.”\n\n“Campaigns need to be aware that the age of social media is an age where donation requests go viral, reaching the furthest corners of the world,” the report notes. “Failure to employ industry standard security and transparent accountability is almost an invitation to foreign money to inject itself into federal campaigns.”\n\nThe United States has laws against foreign campaign donations to protect its sovereignty and, in January 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld these laws banning foreign contributions were constitutional.\n\nThe GAI report recommends election officials: \n\n-   Integrate safeguards to limit the solicitation of money from foreigners by requiring donors with foreign IP addresses to provide proof of U.S. citizenship before they can proceed to the donate page \n-   Immediately require campaigns to use industry-standard anti-fraud security technologies including, but not limited to, the Card Verification Value (CVV) and a rigorous Address Verification System (AVS) \n-   Immediately require all campaigns to retain and disclose identifying information on all online campaign contributions, including those falling under the $200 nondisclosure threshold currently allowed under federal law \n-   Address the threat of “Robo-Donations”: The absence of industry-standard anti-fraud credit card security features render campaigns more vulnerable to so-called “robo-donations.” Robo-donations are large numbers of small, automated donations made through the Internet to evade FEC reporting requirements. \n\nSchweizer, president of GAI, put a particular emphasis on the “robo-donations” that “can literally make a thousand small contributions under different names to fall below the disclosure thresholds.” \n\nThese “robo-donations” essentially allow foreigners to threaten America’s sovereignty and potentially undermine its elections, which is why Schweizer said it is “absolutely essential” to mandate more disclosure and credit card security for campaign donations. \n\n“Amazon.com uses more credit card security for online book purchases than many federal candidates accepting $2,000 campaign donations via credit card,” Schweizer said. “To protect the integrity of U.S. elections, that must change.”\n",

    "passage": "[RF] The Boys of Boma\n\n\n\n\tSweat dripping from his brow, Zuberi strides from the middle of the iridescent soccer field towards the penalty box. He feels the roar of thousands urging him to make the game winning shot of the FIFA World Cup. The stadium seemed to stretch into the heavens. It was filled with thousands of people wearing shades of black, yellow, purple, and white. His sharp brown eyes wandered upward to the scoreboard behind the goal post. The long rectangular box covered in famous sponsors displayed the two large numbers. 3 on one side, and 3 displaying for the opposing team. In his long stride to the goal, he reminisces on his journey to this moment.\n\n\tHis first thoughts trail back to his small home in Boma. Everyday the people of Boma struggled to survive. He remembered the taste of the air the most. Always dry, rain was a blessing that never came. The lack of rain brought hunger for most of the people of Boma. In those days, Zuberi did not have shoes and always thought his feet would one day be like the elders, cracked and rough enough to not be pained by the gravel. The young man was always hungry; his skinny lanky frame reflected that. The village consisted of wooden huts with a well centering the village that on peaceful days provided sustenance for the cattle. A few trees provided shade, which was usually occupied by the wives and young children to work in, while the men tended to the cattle. \n\nThe village attempted to take care of Zuberi’s family, as his father was killed in action with the Swaziland army battalion in the north, after the rebels took his younger brother, but everyone was struggling. Soon after, his mother fell into madness and walked toward the safari in the middle of the night and did not come back. His family was toward the bottom of a long list of problems for Boma. To add to Boma’s problems, every night the village would fear that the rebel army would come and storm the village, setting fire to buildings, attacking or stealing cattle, and enslaving their people.\n\n\tThe first thing he did when he arose in the morning was walk the dry desert to a small mud pit. Zuberi measured the path to be about ten soccer fields long, or at least he felt as tired as he did if he had ran the same length. He used his hands and sticks to dig until he found a water reserve and would fill up an old plastic container until he had enough to get by for the day. Zuberi was a tall, lanky boy, but he was blessed with a strong grip. At times, the small logs would break from the pressure between Zuberi and the dry ground. The walk back to the village with his water bucket everyday had hardened his frame and made him stronger. He had a few reprieves in his long day and one of them was luncheon.\n\n\tZuberi and many other young children in his village considered the thirty-minute break during school to be heaven. It was a small brick house made by the Britains. They would sometimes have sweets and other goods for the children, but his favorite gift to the school was the old soccer ball and goal post. It was actually just three sections of fallen trees near the village that the military had put up, but it brought joy to his life. The school provided small lunches and after scarfing down their food most of the children would use the rest of their short break to go to the weedy soccer field. Most of the grass was in the center and the rest was mostly dirt with a few weeds here and there, but it was big enough and the children’s imagination could do the rest. \n\n“Oi! Zuberi! Oiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!.”\n\nZuberi heard his one friend from Boma that was his age that accompanied him to school named Kibwe. Kibwe was taller than Zuberi, but built much differently. His skin tone was much lighter, with a tremendous wingspan. Kibwe’s arms came down to right above his knees. He was thicker than Zuberi, but both boys were clearly not fed as well as some of the boys they had seen on the satellite television the military men had. He was dressed in an old white collared shirt with red stripes. The white was slightly off color, due to the dirt. He wore knee high baby blue shorts and he had no shoes just like Zuberi.\n\n“Zuberi, are you ready to play today?” Kibwe asked Zuberi.\nAs the words fell from his lips, a big smile spread across Zuberi and Kibwe’s faces. They were blessed with one thing and one thing only: an amazing intellectual and natural ability at soccer. The talent each of them possessed was beyond this world. Most days Zuberi and Kibwe would play against all the other children, and time and time again, they would always manage a way to win. It got to the point where they would dance with the ball with one foot, or Zuberi and Kibwe would have to play on opposing teams to make the game fair. The other children would always think of rules that Zuberi and Kibwe would always more than happily follow. The younger children would always admire them and joke about being the next Roger Milla, or Pele, or Eto, all North African soccer greats. Just names for most of the children, but some had the chance to have seen a few soccer games from the military troops, small satellite televisions or had heard from their parents about the World Championship game in the early nineties. \n\nZuberi and Kibwe would play a game against each other once or twice a month. They had been keeping score for 30 matches, 16 for Zuberi, 10 for Kibwe, and 4 were draws. However after their 31st match a small argument took place between the boys.\nKibwe swallowed his luncheon before he spoke about the match.\n“So, we’ve been playing matches for months now and we’ve come to a tie! A thirteen-thirteen split, with 4 draws!\n\nZuberi almost choked on his rice, while sitting cross legged in the brick school house.\n“I think not. You recall wrong.”\n\n“What makes you so certain?”\n\n“Whose snoring was it that shook the rafters in arithmetic? The score is now sixteen for myself, and 11 for you, and four draws.\n\n“I suppose that could be a good point.”\n\nSoccer was their favorite reprieve they had from their rough life. Between the rebel army and the government troops fighting and children being taken in the middle of the night, it was surprising that soccer brought them so much joy.\n\n The biggest thing the boys looked forward to was the semi-annual soccer tournament between the neighboring villages. It only consisted of three teams, one from each neighboring village, and sure enough every team had heard about the Boys from Boma. The tournament only drew a small crowd of no more than fifty spectators, but in the children’s minds it was as large as one of the World Cup games they had heard of in their books and through the words of elders. The cheers from their small village felt like thousands were screaming for them to win. The biggest worry for the boys was the neighboring village of Jelani. They had a full roster and substitutes and had soccer balls with an actual field to play in.\n\nKibwe and Zuberi game planned for weeks for this tournament. Of course, the two boys were the captains for Boma. They would train and drill the younger children at school after their short lunch breaks. The drills would have them juggling the ball around the small weeds, substitutes for cones, running back and forth across the field, and even the military men would come outside and cheer on the children from time to time.\nAs the morning of the tournament came, Zuberi, as on every morning went to the mud pits to fetch his remaining siblings water for the day. He felt exhilarated. He had the drive to win, and his sibling urged him to bring the honor to Boma. \nJelani was closer to the riverbank, and because of this had short fields of grass for the cattle and for the boys to play on. The men of Jelani had ushered the cattle the last few weeks to shorten the grass for the makeshift soccer field for the boys. The children were not to be fazed. A few of the boys who had siblings and mothers come to the game waved at them sitting cross legged on one side of the field. There were no field markings, but it was grass and Zuberi loved the feeling of the grass between his feet. The itchiness did not bother him, it was much softer than the gravel and dirt he was used to.\n\nThe tournament was setup so that the home town of Jelani received a first round bye and Boma and Mabani would face each other. Zuberi and Kibwe dominated all aspects of this game and scored goal after goal, which soon led to a four to nothing score after the final yell to declare time from an elder was blown. Zuberi glanced at the boys on the Jelani side of the field and saw in their eyes a level of respect.\nThe two boys were drenched in sweat, but kept their faces stiff and showed no signs of fatigue. Little did the players of Jelani know, the two stars were exhausted. They had rooted all their energy toward the first game.  Jelani was well rested and prepared. The other children of Boma would have to play hard this game to have the chance to defeat Jelani. \n“We need you this game, Zuberi,” Kibwe said as he put a hand on Zuberi’s shoulder.\n“I have played too hard the first game, I don’t think I can push that hard again,” Zuberi replied.\n\n“You’ve always been better than me. You’ve always been better than the soldiers and the elders. I don’t think I’ve seen you ever try as hard as you can. You see all those people are out there just for us. You must push. You are the best player in North Africa.”\n\nAn opening yelp from an elder began the game. Jelani started aggressive and pushed toward Boma. The Jelani team was on the Boma side of the field for most of the game, but the score was still drawn to zero to zero at the half. Kibwe called his for his teammates to play for each other and to give everything they could for thirty more minutes and not let their practice times at lunch go to waste.\n\n“For us sportsmen who want to be champions, the mind is as important, than any other part of the body. We have trained hard and we have come too far to lose now. The only way to win is as a team. Football is not about two or three stars. There is no trophy for this game, but there is still a prize. Bragging rights.”\n\nMentally reinvigorated, the Boma team stepped back on the field. Both teams pushed hard, but Jelani seemed to have the advantage, but as the referee called for extra time, with Jelani on the Boma side of the field, Kibwe dished his leg out toward the opposing striker and managed to steal the ball. Kibwe dribbled across the side line with the ball and saw Zuberi toward the half way mark. With so many players pushing forward for Jelani, the only players they had in the back field were two defenders and their goalie. The boys from Boma were both in the opponent’s side of the field, with Zuberi toward the penalty box and Kibwe more toward the far corner. One of the defenders was starting to rush toward Kibwe and he knew that Zuberi could beat anyone man to man. Kibwe launched the ball in the air toward Zuberi as he caught it up with the top of his foot. He didn’t have much time as the rest of the Jelani squad were rushing toward their side of the field. A small side step and a spin later the only thing left between Boma’s soccer team’s bragging rights was the goalie. Zuberi stopped feeling the ache in his shoulders, and legs and only felt the ball. Everything in his mind went silent and the world seemed to slow down.  All he could hear was Kibwe’s echo, “You are the best player in North Africa.” His whole body tuned into the kick, he raised his leg and all the sound rushed back into his head and felt the sores in his body once more. A defender had blind sided him before he could pull the kick off. Groans from the Boma side of the crowd were immediate as well as a few boys wrestling on the other side of the field. \n\n\tThe referee called for a penalty shot. As would happen in similar fashion many years later. Zuberi strided toward the penalty box, sweat dripping from his brow, and what felt like thousands cheering for him to make the game winning shot, but then as the ball was placed in front of him. He heard nothing but silence. His body still ached, but it was time for him to end the game. He rushed the ball, and lifted his leg once more to strike the ball toward the goal. It was all a young boy could take and as he struck the ball he fell forward, but he had barely touched the ground as his teammates hoisted him up on their shoulders.  He felt immense joy and he felt that his smile was almost too big for his face. All he saw was everyone looking at him pride and ivory smiles from all his teammates. Nothing seemed to go right for him, but this was his one time that he could feel happy and be prideful of something. \n\n“Oi! Eto or Pele can’t even stop Zuberi and Kibwe!” A teammate shouted.\nThe rest of the day the young boys chanted, “The Boys from Boma!”\nThe next day was the same as every day in Boma. The boys woke up, as always, dug in the mud pits and hauled their buckets of water back toward home. The older boys and men tended to the cattle, and the young children walked to school. Once again, the boys ate their lunches quickly, so they could spend some more time on the soccer field, but today there was a tall dark middle aged man on the field with his hands behind his back. A big smile was across his face, with a big gap in the middle. He was muscular, but not as tall as some of the men in the village, but definitely was eating much better. His eyes lit up as he saw all the young boys running toward him, kicking up dust in their strides.\n\n“Oi! Who are you old man! This is our field!” One little boy said aggressively.\nThe man replied, “I have come to see the Boys from Boma.”\nKibwe and Zuberi stepped forward, a little nervous hop in their steps.\n“I come from the capital Yaounde, and even I have heard about the two skilled strikers from Boma. I wish to play you both in a little match.” The long smile did not drop from the old man’s face as he brought his hands around to show the boys a brand new soccer ball. \n\nThe boys eyes lit up and a few even had their mouths open. \n“If you defeat me, you shall keep this.”\nThe other boys from the school had dropped to the sidelines and the only people left on the field were Zuberi, Kibwe, and the mysterious dark man and the whistle that sounded through the air. \n\n\tThe man dominated Zuberi and Kibwe, besting them at the game they were best at. The poor boys stood defeated without soccer ball in hand and felt the misery of Boma once again, but the man tossed the ball toward the children without a second thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Zuberi and his friend had constant victories up to the point where they meet the man. While it is not directly stated, it is implied that by meeting the man and experiencing defeat for the first time, Zuberi matured as a player. There is a concept of learning from experiencing mistakes. Prior to meeting the man, Zuberi knows the concept of losing but has not felt it for himself since he always wins. So while Zuberi has had a rival to grow with, he has never met an opponent who would be able to best him to a degree that he realizes that the sport he plays has so much more depth than he thought. This gives him an additional goal to reach or obstacle to overcome. While this kind of experience may not generally be a source of growth for all people (each individual has their own personalities), the narrative implies that it did apply to Zuberi. "

    "passage": "One Hundred Steps\n\n_I CENTO PASSI_ (English: _ONE HUNDRED STEPS_ or _THE HUNDRED STEPS_) is an Italian film released in 2000, directed by Marco Tullio Giordana about the life of Peppino Impastato, a political activist who opposed the Mafia in Sicily. The story takes place in the small town of Cinisi in the province of Palermo, the home town of the Impastato family. One hundred steps was the number of steps it took to get from the Impastato house to the house of the Mafia boss Tano Badalamenti. The film has been released on Regions 2 and 4 DVDs but a Region 1 release has yet to be made.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe film opens with Peppino as a small child singing the popular song “Nel blu, dipinto di blu” with his brother in the back seat of a car on the way to a family gathering. The family is of good standing in the community and they are celebrating this. In this scene, the relationship between Peppino and his uncle Cesare Manzella is established. His uncle is a Don or Mafia boss in the small town of Cinisi where the story is set. In a scene, soon after the happy family gathering, we see Don Cesare killed by a car bomb which was planted by a rival Mafia boss. This ends Peppino’s time of innocence. Even as a small child he is thrust into the realities of life in the Mafia.\n\nAfter his uncle’s funeral, he goes to a local painter, Stefano Venuti, who is also a very outspoken member of the communist party in Sicily, to paint a picture of Cesare. Stefano refuses and does not really give him a reason. He did not get along with Cesare when he was alive because of their great difference in political views but he cannot explain this to the sad stubborn little boy. Stefano ends up taking Peppino under his wing and puts his stubborn persistent energy to better use by working with the Communist Party in Sicily. The story then jumps to when Peppino is a young adult in his early 20s protesting against the government expropriating land that belonged to local farmers to build an airport with his Comrades in the Communist Party. They all end up in the local jail where Peppino is bailed out by his father.\n\nAfter this incident, Peppino brings Stefano an article he has written for a local propaganda newspaper titled “La Mafia è una montagna di merda” or “The Mafia is a pile of shit” which Stefano deems to be too extreme and very dangerous to publish. This is the point where there is a break between Peppino and Stefano. Peppino becomes more and more extreme in his hatred for the Mafia and his need to expose all of the corruption that is happening in the town. Peppino and his father get into an argument because of this article and this causes a rift between Peppino and his family.\n\n[The house of Gaetano Badalamenti, hundred steps from Peppino's family house] Peppino’s next step to expose the Mafia was to create a radio station with his friends called “radio Aut” which condemned the Mafia and told about don Tano’s participation in the drug trade. At this point, Peppino’s father is under a lot of pressure to make his son stop what he is doing. Peppino gets kicked out of his family’s house. His mother is still looking out for him. She brings him books and keeps him hidden from his father. Meanwhile, Luigi cannot handle the situation that Peppino has created at home so he goes to visit his relatives in America. They tell him that they can get Peppino a job in radio in America if he wants.\n\nShortly after Luigi returns from America, he has a conversation with Peppino and then gets hit by a car on his walk home from his restaurant. Peppino does not acknowledge his father's Mafia friends at his funeral. This was not unexpected from him and it was rude and dangerous. By this point, Peppino starts to doubt in the people's commitment to resist the Mafia. He feels like he is all alone in his resistance. He decides to run for office in a local election running under a very small leftist party while continuing his radio crusade.\n\nThe Mafia eventually gets tired of Peppino and decides that life would be easier without him. They have men follow him in his car one night and when he stops at a railroad crossing they drag him out of his car beat him until he cannot move, tie him to the railroad tracks with TNT and blow him up. His friends realize that something's up and go looking for Peppino. They cannot find anything until the morning when they find the police in the spot where Peppino has been killed. They can see the blood on the ground from where he was beaten. They protest vehemently to the police to investigate it as murder (as it obviously was from the evidence) but the police, having been influenced by the Mafia, rule the case terrorist act, and then later on as suicide and leave. At his funeral, there is a huge demonstration of support from the many people who he had made an impact on in his ten years of anti-Mafia and Communist party work.\n\nPeppino Impastato was killed on May 9, 1978. The case was originally treated as a suicide and no one was convicted for his murder until 1997 when the case was reopened and Gaetano Badalamenti was convicted and given a life sentence for the murder of Peppino Impastato.\n\n\nMain characters\n\n-   Giuseppe “Peppino” Impastato – Played by Luigi Lo Cascio is the young activist that this movie is based on. At a young age he became very aware of the harsh reality of the Mafia when his uncle was blown up by a car bomb. He becomes a very active member of the Communist party in Sicily. He creates a radio station, radio Aut, to get the word out on how bad the Mafia is and identifies the Mafia boss on the air. He also used it as an extreme form of free speech and a rallying point for the youth of Sicily.\n-   Luigi Impastato – Played by Luigi Maria Burruano is Peppino’s father and works for the local Mafia boss who is the center of all of the local drug trade.

    "passage": "Censorship in North Korea\n\nCENSORSHIP IN NORTH KOREA ranks among some of the most extreme in the world, with the government able to take strict control over communications. North Korea is ranked at the bottom of Reporters Without Borders' annual Press Freedom Index, occupying the last place in 2017.\n\nAll media outlets are owned and controlled by the North Korean government. As such, all media in North Korea get their news from the Korean Central News Agency. The media dedicate a large portion of their resources toward political propaganda and promoting the personality cult of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il[1] and Kim Jong-un. The government of Kim Jong-un still has absolute authority over and control of the press and information.[2]\n\n\nHistory\n\nKim Il-sung (Leader from 1948-1994)\n\n[Mural of Kim Il-sung outside Songdowon Hotel, Wonsan]\n\nKim Il-sung was born an ordinary man named Kim Sung-ju on April 15, 1912 at the peak of European and Japanese imperialism.[3] Kim Il-sung's rule was based on ruthless abuses, including frequent use of enforced disappearances and deadly prison camps to inflict fear and repress any voices challenging this rule.[4] Kim Il-sung's hardline views of limiting the freedom of expression of the North Korean people has been kept alive by current Supreme Leader and grandson of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un. Today, all local North Korean media outlets are run by the state. Radios and television sets are physically altered to only receive channels chosen by the state.[5]\n\nNorth Korea's biggest economic, political and military benefactor under Kim Il-sung was the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin reportedly handpicked Kim Il-sung, who was a fluent Russian speaker to lead North Korea.[6] To help consolidate power, Kim Il-sung launched the Concentrated Guidance Campaign; a massive ideological census and registration of the background and political purity of each and every North Korean. The Soviet influence in North Korea was endorsed under Kim Il-sung and the censorship seen in North Korea today began with the nationalization of major industries, labor reforms, seizure of privately owned land and a propaganda campaign to enhance Kim Il-sung's image in North Korean minds.[7]\n\n1946-present: The Korean Central News Agency\n\n[Propaganda in North Korea|left]\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the state news agency of North Korea that was established on December 5, 1946. The agency portrays the views of the North Korean government for other foreign powers and countries to consume. According to its website, KCNA “speaks for the Workers' Party of Korea and the government”. It is seen as the most influential news outlet in North Korea because its messages are geared toward foreigners and North Korea's population of 24 million people.[8]\n\nIt is the main, state-run news organization and is responsible for all news in North Korea and also distributes photos. Their content is available in Korean, English, Spanish and Japanese. From Jan. 1, 2011, the site also began offering video. The KCNA often broadcasts North Korean and pro-Kim propaganda. It has also reported fake achievements of North Korea, such as its space program and its standard of living as compared to the United States. It continues to label South Korea and the United States as “imperialists”.[9] The news agency acts as the nation's public relations and multimedia firm, with news that is not hard to tell from propaganda. South Korea's Ministry of Defence maintains a group of readers who try to interpret the significance of the news agency's output. Some themes the KCNA consistently cover include denouncing the actions of the United States and Japan as well as promoting the celebrity and personality of Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-il. Their 2,000 employees are under strict watch to make sure they report in favor of their country.\n\nJang Song-thaek was considered the second most powerful figure in North Korea next to Kim Jong-un before he was executed because he was seen as a “counter-revolutionary” to the government. After his death in 2013, it is reported that 35,000 articles of Korean-language original reporting were deleted by the KCNA and his name was taken off every article in one of the outlet's biggest censorship crackdowns.[10]\n\nKim Jong-il (Leader from 1994-2011)\n\nKim Jong-il was made commander-in-chief and head of the military affairs commission by his father Kim Il-sung in the spring of 1994. Later that year in July, Kim Il-sung died of a heart attack and Kim Jong-il became the next member of the Kim Dynasty to rule North Korea.[11] Kim Jong-il upheld his father's authoritarian regime and strict censorship. He was known for using military propaganda to distract North Korean citizens from their lack of freedoms and access to outside information. Despite only giving citizens access to hyper-militarized government propaganda, many cell phones and DVDs were obtained illegally under Kim Jong-il.[12]\n\nIn 1983, Kim Jong-il's book _The Great Teacher of Journalists_ was translated into English. In this book, Kim Jong-il guides journalists to take the best pictures of their leader, study their leader's works, and instill loyalty to their leader in others. Kim Jong-il includes stories of his own remarkable feats in this book, detailing when he saved a reporter from death and when he edited someone's political essay to perfection.[13] In the eyes of Kim Jong-il, a journalist's purpose is not to report the truth, but instead to loyally praise their leader.\n\n2004-2008: Cell phone ban\n\nThe North Korean government has implemented policies to prevent outside sources of information from reaching the people of North Korea. Starting in the 1990s when famine overtook the country, traders used cell phones as a means to illegally bring food and goods across the border.[14] Cellular devices were introduced in North Korea in 2002 only to be temporarily banned two years later.[15][16]\n\nIn December 2008 Orascom Telecom, an Egyptian company, introduced North Korea to Koryolink, a 3G network. Internet access is permitted only for foreign travelers or the elite.[17] By 2015, three million North Koreans had subscribed to Koryolink. Users of Koryolink must apply for permission to subscribe and are “subject to controls and surveillance by at least eight ministries and organizations between the party, state and army.” The network does not allow any access to international calls. Users sometimes will receive propaganda messages.[18]\n\nIn 2013, foreigners were granted 3G mobile phone Internet access by monthly data plan; the service could be implemented via USB modem or SIM Card.[19] Recently, with more government awareness of alternative access to external information, increased security measures to eliminate these resources have been enacted.[20] This includes higher border security where illicit cell phones gain access to China's mobile networks.[21]\n\nThese phones could be vehicles for releasing detailed news of harsh ruling within the country which is prohibited. Beyond punishment for those using phones within the country, danger exists for escapees spreading knowledge of the country's extreme laws. Text messages and cell phone photographs are sent to external journalists and activists in South Korea to spread knowledge of the conditions. Some North Koreans act as journalists and sources by sending information and sharing stories. Prominent news accounts surrounding Kim Jong-un's ankle surgery and his wife, Ri Sol-ju's 2012 pregnancy were released from these insiders.[22]\n\nAs social media and news applications via smartphone become the common thread of news outlets, North Korea pushes further curtailment. A tightly controlled cyberspace exists within the country where a small number of upper class citizens have access to an intranet, called Kwangmyong.[23] In contrast to the otherwise global World Wide Web, this independent resource provides communication between industry, universities, and government. It is used to spread information through chats and emails which are both monitored and filtered by the government, allowing only a select group of researchers, propagandists, and media workers to access state media and items which have been removed from the public's Internet.\n\nKim Jong-un (Leader from 2011-present)\n\n[Kim Jong-un in March 2018]\n\nKim Jong-un rules with a heavy hand and has worked to consolidate power since becoming the supreme ruler of North Korea on December 28, 2011.[24] He ordered the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, and allegedly commanded the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam.[25]\n\nKim Jong-un keeps North Korea under his surveillance through extreme censorship. As of April 2020, the regime has a press freedom score from the Press Freedom Index rankings (made by Reporters Without Borders) of 83.4, with 100 being the worst score, and is ranked last in global rankings of 180 countries.[26] North Korean journalists must belong to the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and adjust their reportings to positively reflect Kim Jong-un's leadership. Foreign media are not welcomed and are often used as scapegoats by North Korean media.[27] Failure to follow strict guidelines as set forth by the WPK can lead to imprisonment, forced labor or death.[28]\n\nHuman rights violations in North Korea raise global concern. Kim Jong-un's regime is notorious for torture, mysterious disappearances and sexual violence. Each layer of the government is structured to expel potential political threats and disseminate the ideology of Kim Jong-un, and those who attempt to circumvent censorship face steep consequences.[29]\n\n\nRadio and television censorship\n\nRadio or television sets which can be bought in North Korea are preset to receive only the government frequencies and sealed with a label to prevent tampering with the equipment. It is a serious criminal offence to manipulate the sets and receive radio or television broadcasts from outside North Korea. In a party campaign in 2003, the head of each party cell in neighborhoods and villages received instructions to verify the seals on all radio sets.[30]\n\nBecause North and South Korea have used different analog television systems (PAL and NTSC respectively), it has not been possible to view broadcasts across the border between the two countries without problems in reception or additional equipment.[31]\n\nAccording to the _Daily NK_, it is possible to broadcast news for North Korea through short-wave radio. Possessing a short-wave radio is against the law in North Korea, but the radios are allegedly confiscated and resold by corrupted agents of secret police.[32]\n\n“A Quiet Opening: North Koreans in a Changing Media Environment,” a study commissioned by the U.S. State Department and conducted by InterMedia and released May 10, 2012, found that despite strict regulations and draconian penalties, North Koreans, particularly the elites, have increasing access to news and other media outside the state-controlled media authorized by the government. While access to the internet is controlled, radio and DVDs are common media accessed, and in border areas, television.[33][34] Up to one in two urban households own a Notel (also called Notetel), a portable media player made in China which has been popular in North Korea since about 2005 and was legalized in 2014, and has been credited with facilitating the extension of the “Korean Wave” (_Hallyu_, the increase of the popularity of South Korean pop culture internationally) into North Korea.[35][36][37]\n\nAs of 2011, USB flash drives were selling well in North Korea, primarily used for watching South Korean dramas and films on personal computers.[38]\n\n\nJournalism\n\nNorth Korea is ranked at the bottom of the Press Freedom Index rankings published annually by Reporters Without Borders. From 2002 through 2006, the country was listed as the worst in the world and from 2007 to 2016, it was listed second to last (behind Eritrea) of some 180 countries.[39][40][41][42] In 2017 and 2018, North Korea was ranked the worst again.[43] In 2019, it was rated second to last, above Turkmenistan.[44] In 2020, it was once again ranked last.[45]\n\nTo become a journalist in North Korea, one has to graduate from college. After an ideology review and a strict background check, the student is drafted by the college dean and the managers. The drafted journalist will normally go through a probation period of 4 to 5 years and is then stationed after an assessment.\n\nIn North Korea, journalism as a job is to guard, defend, and advocate for and defend both the party and party leaders. Since the role is defined as being a political activist and a fighter who can mobilize a crowd, a journalist in North Korea should be a true Kim Il-sung-ist and a fervent political activist, with a war correspondent spirit and political qualification. Journalists in North Korea are reeducated continuously.\n\nThe organization that takes charge of the reeducation of journalists in North Korea is the 'Chosen Reporter Alliance.' It is the strongest and the most systematized organization among the reporters and journalists' political idea education organizations. The organization trains journalists and reporters on philosophy, economics, world history, world literature, and foreign languages.\n\nArguing about the contradictions in the system of North Korea itself is considered treason and is treated as a major violation in North Korean society. Over 70 percent of reports of Korean Central Broadcasting are allotted for Kim's idolization and propaganda system. The rest of the reports are spent on blaming and predicting the collapse of the United States, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nThe reporters in North Korea spend their time writing flattering articles about the Kim Dynasty. Kim Jong-il used to punish the people who wrote from different point of view, saying “Words describe one's ideas.”[46]\n\nAfter reeducation, a journalist who works for over 15 years and has made a major contribution is titled a 'distinguished journalist.'[47]\n\n\nInternet policies\n\nIn 2006, Julien Pain, head of the Internet Desk at Reporters Without Borders, described North Korea as the world's worst Internet black hole,[48] in its list of the top 13 Internet enemies.[49]\n\nInternet access is not generally available in North Korea. Only some high-level officials are allowed to access the global internet.[50] In most universities, a small number of strictly monitored computers are provided. Other citizens may get access only to the country's national intranet, called Kwangmyong.[51] Content on Kwangmyong is curated by Korea Computer Center.[52] Foreigners can access the internet using the 3G phone network.[53][54] However, the IT industry has been growing and Internet access is starting to increase within North Korea.[55]\n\nThe North Korean Ullim, an Android-based tablet computer available since 2014, has a high level of inbuilt surveillance and controls. The tablet takes screenshots of apps opened by the user and saves browsing history.[56]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] “World briefings: North Korea”, New York Times, June 4, 2004.\n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44]  RSF|website=Reporters Without Borders}}\n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n\n[47] \n\n[48] \n\n[49] \n\n[50] \n\n[51] \n\n[52] \n\n[53] \n\n[54] \n\n[55] \n\n[56] \n",

    "passage": "[TH] The Blackboard\n\nRufus and Daniel entered the classroom and sat down on their desks. A teacher followed them inside.\n\n“Do you know why you two are in here this time?” she asked as she stood in front of them with her arms crossed.\n\n“Yes, Ms. Flora,” they both said without any effort.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because we were throwing paper balls at you…”\n\nShe nodded. “This is the tenth time you’re in detention. The tenth! I hope you will both think about what you’ve done, and never do it again!” She grabbed a chalk and began writing on the blackboard. \n\nThe classroom was pretty ordinary. It had posters of the alphabet and numbers, the rules of the classroom, and how to have proper hygiene. The students’ desks were arranged in 6 rows of 5. Some of them were covered with poor graffiti like, “'X' and 'X' for life” and “so and so was here.” The walls were decorated with students’ artwork and stories. Ms. Flora’s desk was neat and organized. It had students’ finished homework on one pile, graded tests on another, and folders of what the students have done all year. That’s all there was. No picture of family, no apple on desk, nothing else. The rest of the homework and classwork for the students to do in the future was put away in her drawers—as well as pencils, paper clips, pens, thumbtacks, chalk, crayons, and any other tools she—or the students—needed to use for class.\n \nShe was writing down the lesson for tomorrow: adding and subtracting. She wrote down problems to solve. Rufus put his head down on his table and Daniel sat quietly. When Ms. Flora was finished writing, she put down the chalk. She opened the blinds, revealing a pleasant day. The sun wasn’t out, but the sky was blue, and it wasn’t too cloudy. Kids were having fun on the playground. They were swinging on the swings, playing tag, basketball, and played with their wrestling action figures in the sandbox; some just spoke to each other. She watched them all smiling, not worrying about life and having a good time. \n\n“Look at them,” she growled.  “How repulsive.” She stared at the blackboard, and then she picked up the chalk again. \n\n\nTwo plus two \n\n\nThree plus three\n\n\nFive minus four\n\n\nThe chalk tapped against the blackboard, with an inconsistent rhythm.\n\n\nTwenty minus eleven\n\n\nTen minus seven\n\n\nShe cringed when she heard the children’s laughter. \n\n\nFifty minus twenty\n\n\nShe kept hearing the children outside. She gritted her teeth, and tried to ignore them.\n\n\nOne thousand plus three hundred seventy five\n\n\nShe wrote vigorously.\n\n\nFive hundred thousand minus three hundred thousand, one hundred and seventy five\n\n\nThe writing became faster.\n\n\nSeven hundred thousand plus four hundred thousand, six hundred twenty one\n\n\nTheir voices went through one of her ears, but it didn’t come out of the other.\n\n\nOne million minus one hundred thousand, seven hundred and three \n\n\nShe grunted out of frustration and stopped. She took a deep breath, and then began writing with more intensity.\n\n\nIn all my years of teaching, I have never met such spoiled little brats!\n\n\nYou have done so many terrible things to me: super gluing me to my chair, ripping up homework and classwork that I had ready to pass out, putting gum on the blackboard, and even eating my lunch! That’s not to say that I didn’t hate any of my other students that I had over the years; I despise all of the students that I have ever taught. Well, maybe not all of them. Only a select few behaved. Each year, I would only have about four or five of those in each class. They were rare. But as for all those other pesky kids, I hate them all. They spoke during the middle of my lessons. They didn’t do their homework. They didn’t pay any attention to me at all. Many of them slept, not caring. \n\n\nYou delinquents made my job impossible! I have a bad reputation. Those other damn teachers, telling me that I’m not a good enough. They tell me that I don’t put in enough effort to try to keep you pests under control. They tell me that I should quit! I put all my heart and soul into teaching! And you know what I get in return? A slap in the face! You don’t care, none of you do! Only those few cared… but now they’ve moved on in life. And this year, I only like one or two out of all my students in each of my classes. Their numbers keep decreasing! So this doesn’t apply to those students that I like. You know what I’d like to imagine doing to all of you troublemakers? I’d like to imagine locking you all up in my basement. There wouldn’t be food or water for any of you to have in there, so you would all suffer and die.\n\n\nDaniel watched what Ms. Flora was writing. “Hey,” he whispered to Rufus, “look at what she’s writing.”\n\nRufus lifted his head up, half awake. He groaned. “But that’s so boring.” \n\n“Trust me, it isn’t,” said Daniel while trying to sound convincing. He pointed at the blackboard. “Just look!”\n\n“Okay, I guess…” Rufus watched what the teacher was writing. He frowned when he saw what the words said.\n\n\nI’d like to imagine tying your hands behind your back and blindfolding you all. I’d line you up. I would shoot you all down, one by one. You would all be terrified, waiting until it was your turn. \n\n\n“What? Why is she writing all this crazy stuff?” asked Rufus.\n\n\nI’d like to take you all to my home, and throw you into my fireplace. I’d enjoy listening to all of your screams of agony as you burn alive.\n\n\n“Did we hurt her that bad?” asked Daniel.\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\nI’d like to perform surgery on all of you, without any anesthesia. And I’m no doctor! \n\n\n“But what we did to you was harmless…” said Rufus out loud to the teacher. “And you want to make us suffer in the worst way possible? And then, have us killed?”\n\nMs. Flora didn’t pay attention to what he told her, and kept on writing.\n\n\nDo you know how hard it is having to deal with all of you? It’s a living nightmare! I dread every single day that I have to come into this classroom. Why should I allow you all to keep making my life miserable? No, not this time. You rodents deserve to die…\n\n\nShe put down the chalk and searched her desk. She checked through all her papers and tools, throwing them on the floor. She tipped the desk over and pulled out the drawers, one by one. She dropped out everything that was in them and threw the drawers against the walls. \n\n“Um… Ms. Flora, what are you doing?” asked Daniel.\n\nShe dug up the mess she made. Papers and tools went flying in all directions.\n\nShe picked up a gun that was in the pile. “Hah! This school has such lousy security.”\n\n“W-Why do you have that?” asked Rufus\n\nShe laughed.\n\n“No, please, don’t kill us!” exclaimed Daniel, terrified.\n\nThe laughter continued.\n\nRufus tugged on Daniel’s shirt and pointed at the door. \n\nThey both ran for it and tried to open it. It was locked. Ms. Flora stood there—for what seemed like hours to the both of them—facing the blackboard, while holding the gun in her hand.\n\n“We’re sorry, Ms. Flora. We didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. We won’t do it again! Honest.” Daniel backed away to the back of the room slowly.\n\n“P-please stop! If this is a prank to make us stop bothering you, then you win!” said Rufus.\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\n“It’s over!” said Daniel as he had his back against the wall, sliding down.  “We’re done for.”\n\n“We shouldn’t have bothered her… She’s gone insane.” Rufus sat at his desk and held his head in despair. \n\nThey both cried hysterically.\n\nMore silence. Ms. Flora flipped the gun over and over, staring at the ground. She observed all the words that she put on the blackboard. She heaved a sigh, and then picked up the chalk once more. She wrote:\n\n\nYou poor thing… suffering for all these years. Look at you, you’re so pathetic. You could never handle mischievous children, and you never will. The pain just keeps growing, doesn’t it? It’s gotten to the point where you can’t take it anymore. But don’t worry. It will all end. You deserve to die just as much as they do, too.\n\nShe put the chalk down, and put the gun to her head. She gave Rufus and Daniel an odious grin, and pulled the trigger. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head as she dropped the gun. Her body landed on the floor with a loud thud. \n\nThey both sniffled as the last of their tears were exposed. They stood up, mouths open. Petrification took over their bodies—they didn't make any noise. They couldn’t stop staring at the blood that poured out of Ms. Flora’s head.\n\n\n\n\n",

The way the sun shines on your skin and makes you almost as bright as the winters first snow. I breathe slowly, not to disrupt your sweet dreams. I love you.\n\nDecember 22nd, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYou stir to my fingers brushing your hair, softly, just like one would through a child's. You open your beautiful green eyes to start the beginning of your new adventure. Our fingers interlocked, the spaces filled perfectly. I couldn't ask for a better feeling. I love you.\n\nDecember 23rd, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nThe scent of warm hot chocolate fills the room. Your favorite. A smile spreads across your face, the smile that tells me you feel what I feel. Breakfast in bed was my early gift to you. A gift I could give you for the rest of our lives. I love you.\n\nDecember 24th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nThe excitement of our first Christmas together excites you. I hold you close, feeling the warmth and comfort of your body against mine. A small kiss makes everything perfect. You make me feel complete. I love you.\n\nDecember 25th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYou wake me up with a warm kiss on the lips. Merry Christmas my love, our very first holiday together. You're as excited as a child. That makes me smile. I give you your gift, it's small, but I know you'll love it. You open it and immediately know the answer. I love you.\n\nDecember 26th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nThe ring sits perfectly on your finger. I stroke the top of your hand and kiss your shoulder. You have to work soon but I don't want to wake you from your slumber. I don't want you to leave. I never do. I love you.\n\nDecember 27th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYou're restlessly tossing and turning. I do my best to keep the blankets over you. I lean over and put my arm across you and place my body against yours. You settle. I worry. I love you.\n\nDecember 28th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI wake up to the sound of you softly crying. The tears roll off your cheek, I pull you into me and you rest your head on my chest and quietly sob. The darkness has engulfed you again. I won't let it hurt you anymore. I love you.\n\nDecember 29th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYou're awake before me. Staring at the ceiling, caressing my hand softly. I kiss your cheek softly and you give me a warm smile. I see the pain in your eyes. It shatters my soul with every second I look at you. You have to leave for work soon. I want you to stay with me. I love you.\n\nDecember 30th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYour breath on my neck wakes me up. You look like you've been crying for hours. I hold you close and listen to your soft rhythmic breathing fill my ears. I'm afraid. I love you\n\nDecember 31st, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nNew Years Eve, you tell me that you don't want to get out of bed today. The darkness is getting worse. You take your medication and lay back in bed. I bring you tea and some scrambled eggs, just the way you like them. You only eat half then stare blankly at the television. I take your plate to the kitchen and wash it. When I come back in to the bedroom you're playing with your ring. You tell me that you love me and that you're gonna be okay. I know better. I love you.\n\nJanuary 1st, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYou've become pale, the dark circles under your eyes tell me that you are awake when I'm sleeping. You're eyes are bloodshot from all the crying. It kills me to see you in pain. I love you.\n\nJanuary 2nd, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nNo smile. You look at me and I know that you're fighting it. The darkness is stronger this time. I'll get you help, I promise. I love you.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYou take the new dosage doctor gave you. You've lost interest in everything. Your kisses are soft but have a chill to them. The warmth is gone. The sun in your soul is surrounded by a darkness that is darker than the midnight sky. I hope this dosage helps. I love you.\n\nJanuary 4th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI try to wake you up but you don't stir. The room is silent. The pain in my chest is excruciating. I shake you and your pill bottles hit the floor. I fall to the floor. There is nothing I can do but cry. I dial 9-1-1 but I can't speak, I cry so hard that I lose my breath with every sob. The sobs are loud. The ambulance gets here and they put you on a stretcher. I follow holding your hand tightly. It's so cold. D.O.A. I love you..\n\nJanuary 5th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nThe bed feels empty with you gone. I cried all night. The tears are stained on my pillow case. Your scent fills my nose and I cry. I could have saved you. I'm empty without you. I read the note I found yesterday over and over. I'm so sorry baby. I can't take it anymore. I love you so much and I will always be with you. My sobs grow more intense. I miss you.. I love you..\n\nJanuary 6th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI had a dream about you. You looked so happy, so free. You're wings matched your brightness. Seeing your smile made me feel good that you are no longer in pain. I love you..\n\nJanuary 7th, 2010 \nTime 7:00 am\n\nYour funeral is today. I cry as I think of how you are no longer with me. It tears me apart. I feel like part of me has been crushed by a steam roller. I made my side of the bed and got dressed. I love you..\n\nJanuary 8th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYesterday was hard. Seeing you lay almost as peaceful as you did when you slept broke my heart even more. You had an aura of serenity around you. Your skin glowed like it did when the sun hit you just right. I miss you so much. I love you..\n\nJanuary 9th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI made your favorite hot chocolate and scrambled eggs. I'm coming to visit your grave for breakfast. Even though you aren't here, I will still bring you your favorite things to wake up to. Even though I know you won't be waking up this time. I love you..\n\nJanuary 10th,2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI stayed at your grave for three hours. I poured the hot chocolate on the soil above you and dug a small hole to bury the eggs in. I hope you enjoyed them like you always did when you were still here. I cried when I got home, I hurt so bad. I miss you more than anything.. I love you..\n\nJanuary 11th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nHappy 2nd anniversary my love. I miss you. I love you.\n\nJanuary 12th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nIt's getting too hard to sleep in our bed. I slept on the couch in the living room last night with one of your t-shirts. It smelled just like your favorite perfume from the mall. I held it just like I would have held you. I love you..\n\nJanuary 13th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nYour mother called me to make sure I was okay. She's so hurt. The pain in her voice was so much to bear. We miss and love you..\n\nJanuary 14th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI'm going crazy without you.. I miss you.. I love you..\n\nJanuary 15th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI visited your grave again yesterday. I hope you liked the flowers. They were the kind I got you on your birthday in August. Remember how happy you were? I love you..\n\nJanuary 16th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI can't stand being without you anymore.. I love you..\n\nJanuary 17th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI visited you yesterday. I just laid by your head stone and imagined that it was our bed and that you were actually in it. Our nice warm bed, with your warm smooth body laying right by mine. It was a nice thing to think about. I love you..\n\nJanuary 18th, 2010\nTime 7:00 am\n\nI'm scared, but I can't take this pain anymore. I don't know about anything anymore. All I know is that I need you. I can't live with out you. There's a loud snap that fills my ears then a bright light. I see you approaching me, you look as beautiful as ever. Our fingers interlock and you kiss me. I feel no pain, no heartbreak. Just the love that I've felt since I fell in love with you. I'm home now and I'm happy. I love you.",

    "passage": "[SF] Waiting Room\n\n\"Please state the purpose of your visit.\"\nThe woman behind the desk looked at me with blank eyes. There was no one home.\n\"I want to apply for permanent VR residency.\"\n\"Please state your chosen payment plan. If you need help in choosing a payment plan, an appointment with a specialist can be arranged.\"\n\"I know what I want. I'm going to sell my meat.\"\n\"You understand that upon signing a Voluntary Body Custody contract, you are legally obligated to surrender your body to VR Corp and any deviation from, or violation of said contract will result in legal action and repossession without compensation?\"\n\"I understand.\"\n\"Please fill these out to the best of your ability.\"\n\nShe slid a much-abused screen over to me. I picked it up and tabbed through, stepping aside as someone took my place. Financial information, Personal information, and Account information. I found a chair in the back left corner of the room, as far as possible from the other applicants. Meat people make me uncomfortable. The air tasted stale and smelled of cheap carpeting and unwashed bodies. Beside me was a table with an ugly vase full of fake flowers that did nothing to help the odour. \n\nFinancial information was easy enough. The only jobs I have ever worked have been through VR. All my money is in VR banks. When I rent my meat it’s through VR reps. Every story, sim, joke, and game I have ever sold was through VR. That means they already know all about it, and my writing anything here is a formality. I've spent nearly all my waking hours of the last ten years in VR. They already know everything about me, certainly anything worth putting on a form. I dutifully entered my financial information.\n\nPersonal information was harder. I flew through the name-address-date-of-birth stuff, but how do you answer a question like \"Why do you want to permanently upload your mind to VR?\" More accurately, how do you stop answering it? My entire life, it's all I ever wanted, even before VR was a thing. Everything I hated about real life was so much better in VR. In meatworld, people have always judged me, and in a thousand ways, for things that I have never been able to change. \n\nI’m fat. I’ve always been fat. I know I should be skinny but how am I supposed to lose weight when the only way to rent your body to a corp doing physical labour is to already be fit? What am I supposed to do? Spend my days exercising my meat like a damn GenX? Maybe that would work, but only because I would also starve from not being able to work a VR job or rent my meat in the meantime. If only being fat were the end of my problems. After life suplexed me with obesity, puberty finished me off with a chokeslam in the form of perpetual, inflamed, all covering acne. What girl wants to date a guy who looks like a loaf of cheesebread? I just never felt at home in the house I was born in. Now I’m applying for a mortgage on a new one.\nIn VR, when people judge you, it’s for who you are and how you express it. When I got my first headset for my 16th birthday, I spent two days customizing my character in every conceivable way. Which represented who I am better? Two arms or six? Was my personality thin and whiplash strong, or hugely muscular? Would my soul have blonde hair, or black with a streak of purple? In those first two days I felt more pride in my appearance than I had in the 16 years that preceded them. I felt like what I saw in the character creator represented me better than anything I had ever seen in a mirror. \n\nIt wasn't just my appearance either. Nearly everything about how I presented myself was different in VR. I didn't stutter, I didn't censor myself, I was funny, interesting, even outgoing. I had more success with girls within weeks than I had ever dreamed of IRL. It seemed like every creative instinct, every ounce of motivation, every scrap of self-respect I ever had, had simply been waiting for me to find a place where it could come out. To be honest, I was just surprised there was anything worthwhile at all hiding within me. VR basically made everything I've ever liked in my entire life possible. So I guess that would be why I want to leave meatworld behind. The only thing I could possibly regret about this is that I didn't do it sooner.\n\nAs I was overthinking the question, an adfly exploded out of its hiding place, nestled in the stiff plastic leaves of the flowers beside me. As I reached to swat it away, it broke left and dodged my clumsy hands, slipping through my cheap adblocker like a mosquito through a shitty net. The adfly threw its many limbed body onto my face, latching on to my nose. It raised its needle to my left eye. I broke into a cold sweat as I surrendered, lowering my hands. I saw a light shine out of a hole on the ad's carapace, directly onto my right eye.\n\n **** MONSTER-REDBULL GIVES YOU POWER TM ****\n\nFrom above, I saw a version of myself, a bit uglier and noticeably fatter, walking down a street towards a woman sitting on a bench. She was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen, and as I watched, she looked over at my double with a faint air of distaste. My ugly lookalike had almost reached her when I saw a truck leap off the freeway and come crashing through the underbrush at the side of the road. He began to move as fast as his exaggerated build would let him, clearly hoping to grab the oblivious damsel and drag her to safety. They were both crushed as I looked on. Her face was the picture of contempt for her would-be rescuer.\n\n**** FEELING POWERLESS? ****\n\nSuddenly, everything began to move backwards, slowly at first but then faster and faster until the truck and my lame imposter were out of sight. As he moved back into the frame, I saw that my stand-in looked different. He was no longer grossly overweight, he was ripped. He also had a bandolier stocked with cans of Monster-Redbull© around his bulging chest. He locked eyes with the girl from before, who blushed but couldn't look away. The Adonis pulled a can of Monster-Redbull© from his bandolier, shotgunned it, and crushed the thick can between his bicep and forearm. Again the truck came off the freeway and hurtled towards the young woman. This time, however, the man moved towards the charging 18 wheeler, moving faster than the truck itself. He stopped just short of it and, bracing himself, caught the truck by its fender. He used its momentum to lift the truck up and over his head, spinning on his heel as he slammed it down on a man who had approached the girl. His competition vanquished, he caught the swooning girl with one hand while he used the other to shotgun another Monster-Redbull©.\n\n**** MONSTER-REDBULL GIVES YOU POWER TM ****\n\nThe ad left. Careening around the room, it sought its next victim. Shaking, I promised myself I would file a complaint against VR Corp for leaving their building unsecured. Not that there was much point. Monster-Redbull© is probably paying VR Corp to let them in. And I would never have to deal with anything like this once I left this shithole forever. My meatworld adblocker might have been worth fuck all, but my VR one sure wasn't. Yet another reason I should hurry up with this form.\n\nI finished off the other questions in Personal Information quickly. Next came Account Information. More name-address-date-of-birth stuff. I just couldn’t see the point in this. I already had an account, and that account already had all these details. I skipped all the fields until I found Account Number. I filled in all 16 digits, then almost kicked myself when the other fields filled themselves in. That’s it then. Finished. I went to press submit, and found I couldn’t. \nI knew what was next. I would press that button, return the screen, and then they would get a doctor to assess the value of my carcass. Funny that assessing meat is one of the last jobs you need someone to be in their meat for. They would plug me in, and I would leave my body and go live in VR. Forever. It would be the same thing I did every morning, only this time there would be no coming back. My meat would no longer be my meat. It would just be another thing at a desk, or a burger flipper, or a janitor, and it would spend five hours a night in one of those depressing shacks you see behind every strip mall. And I would be my character.\n\nI looked at the tip of my nose. I looked at my legs, my arms, my hands. I saw the scar from when I got over excited playing CoD: Ireland and fell out of my chair, putting spider web cracks in my VR screen and taking a chunk out of my thumb. I had been so mad at myself because the combination of those two disasters killed my promising fps career. Or at least put it off for a while, though I never got back into it… You’re stalling! Press submit dammit! This meat never gave you anything but pain and discomfort, while it took from you any chance you ever had of fitting in to the meatworld! I looked at it again. Now it seemed tired, worn out. I recalled every time I looked out the window at a beautiful day, then shut the blinds. Every time my brother messaged me to come out with him and I didn’t even respond. Every time I was “forced” to eat a tubepizza because my gaming schedule didn’t allow me to take long enough breaks to eat with my family. A sudden sense of clarity struck me.\n\nMy life could have played out so differently. I was weak. I am weak. VR makes it so easy to be strong. But maybe you can’t be strong when you never try to stand without having your hand held. I thought of my parents. They never liked VR. They never liked how much time I spent on it. They were born, grew up, and got married all without a butler whispering in their ear “She’s hitting on you” or “Kill the tension with a joke”. Were the girls I “fucked” in VR fucking me or the time I spent in character creator? Or the wit my butler fed into my ear? Had any of the banter or emotions we shared been real? What was the point? Why not get rid of the middlemen and let the butlers fuck each other, stick a dildo in a fleshlight? The only thing I have ever done in VR is masturbate, or enable another person’s masturbation. Maybe not always physically (though there had been plenty of that), but emotionally, mentally. My whole life I thought I was popular in VR because people were finally seeing the real me. But I wasn’t eight feet tall, I didn’t have rippling abs, and I couldn’t come up with one liners in 0.2 seconds. I am not really my character. I’m something more. I looked down at myself again. For the first time in ten years, I saw me.\n\nThanks for reading! Any comments or criticism are welcome!",

    "passage": "Unfinished piece.\n\nThe sun filters through the canopy of the light poles, trees, and houses. It covers small swaths of land in leprous splotches. The leaves sag and brush against the ground in silent supplication. Reaching towards the sunlight and dew stained grass, plagued with swarming insects that enrich and take away from the plants. Huge bulbs hang from the fibrous branches and a slug eats a rotten tomato in the potting soil. A worm crawls through the confines of the pot. \n\nThe leaves rustle against the breeze. A few errant leaves die and fall to the ground not yet rotted still retaining the semblance of life. Birds fly in ovals and land on humming power lines. They stare at the houses and shit. A car door slams in the distance and the day begins. In chaotic harmony other doors slam within fifteen minute intervals and the hums and roars of engines lead the townsfolk to their jobs.\n\nLily emerges from the house of her father and walks around its perimeter. She examines the plants and takes inventory. She pokes the soil and throws old fruit where she finds room. A truck pulls into the driveway and her father shuts the door silently and walks around the house.\n\nHe finds her pouring water into a pot. “That might be too much water.”\n\n“I don’t think so. There are three tomato plants here. They must all fight over the water and I’ve been diligent about watering them everyday, so I don’t think it’s too much. I could possibly skip a day though. How was work?”\n\n“Another ten hours of bullshit. Inspecting parts, counting inventory dealing with that dickhead Dave. Has anyone called you back yet?”\n\n“No, not that I’m aware of, however, I did just wake up.”\n\nHe lights a cigarette. “Keep telling jokes like that and you could go on tour.”\n\nShe walks to the empty potting soil and examines it. A stray shoot pushes through the ground towards the sky. “I think this red onion might have actually sprouted another onion. I can’t be sure yet, but there is a green shoot coming out of it.”\n\nHe walks over to the plant. “Well, wait and see is all I can tell you. With that, I’m off to bed for the day.”\n\n“Night.” She calls after him while he ascends the steps towards the house.\n\nShe walks around the rest, notes the weeds, and the old grass seed. A young woman walks by with a small dog. Lily waves at the woman. “Cute dog.” \n\nShe returns to the house and starts a load of laundry. The syrup like detergent dances around the centrifugal tube and water fills the basin. Lily searches the refrigerator for eggs and cooks one. She opens her laptop and clicks on the web browser. A message from an old boyfriend and several others checking on her. \n\n“I don’t know why you feel that religion is such an important thing, but I won’t stand in your way of worshiping as long as you don’t tell me I’m going to Hell or that I’m sinful. I won’t be judged by you. Go to your church, but don’t bother trying to date me if you think it will make such a major conflict between us.” No smiley face. Send.\n\nShe checks the two usual job sites and emails her resume to some temp service that promises her that their jobs can lead to full time positions. The usual forums offer no advice in the job hunt only the same mixture of cynicism and hope. Typing a post, she hears the egg sizzle. She walks to the stove and flips the egg, sprinkles pepper on it, and returns to the computer. \n\nThe weather offers no solace to her. Delayed rains only bring the hope of no flash floods. Snores from the bedroom assure her that her father remains asleep. A search brings up a redhead from England who exposes her breasts and pantomimes a blowjob. Lily stares at this woman. \n\nWe’d hold hands and make love. It would be beautiful and we’d be beautiful. We could use each other’s youth and then discard one another. I don’t see what’s wrong with that. Just to brush your soft lips or to run my fingers through your hair, would that be too much to ask. We could search for makeup together or play video games. We could feign gamer girl or be them, we could pretend that we hate men, but we wouldn’t. The men where you are aren’t insane like the ones here. They won’t lie and discard us. They’ll join us in our using of them and understand that we’re enjoying one another not lying to one another. If only,…if only…I could…see you. Ah.\n\nLily raises her panties and closes the laptop. Washing her hands and drying them on a dish towel,  she then returns to the egg and places it on a piece of buttered toast. The pepper tickles her nose and she stifles a sneeze. The toast crunches and the egg’s yolk explodes in her mouth. \n\nIn the distance, metalworkers carry empty canisters of Oxygen and Butane to a collection truck for refilling. The sun stops before the entrance of the metallurgist's shop and he closes the shop door. The truck drives off and whips dust. The metallurgist gulps from a water bottle and spits. He returns to the brick building and continues to spark steel.\n\nLily submerges her hands into the hot water and scrubs the dirt and grime of the dishes. In the basin, the water sloshes and spills onto the counter. Plates delicately klink in the drainer. Lily spies from across the street, the metal workers hoisting long tubes of Oxygen into the back of a truck. She sighs slightly and continues to wash.\n\nShe opens a book and starts to take notes and to underline passages. She marks a date on her calendar and then shuts it. She studies bastardizations of classic authors with half paragraph blurbs about their lives and their works translated from the original language. Twisting the top off of a beer, she sits back down and reads. \n\nHer father yawns and belches. He stomps into the room. “What are you doing?”\n\n“Studying for this class. It’s something to do with the Classics. Something about Shakespeare and Chaucer. I don’t really care about who else. I also need to study for that Chemistry test, but I really don’t feel like it. Did you know that there are people in the world that don’t go to college and they end up fine.” She sips.\n\n“Yeah, they end up working the same job for ten plus years and never go anyway. I’m not sending you to college to stay in one spot. I want you to learn something that will make you better. I don’t want you to end up like those idiots who take pictures of themselves in the bathroom of restaurants with their tits hanging out, or getting pregnant by accident. College will help you, it’s just that the help is abstract and non-practical. I don’t live by practical it’s worthless. That blond girl that worked at the fast-food joint, you remember?”\n\n“No why?’ Lily sips.\n\n“She got her degree in nursing through a technical program. She’s stuck there, because she can’t for two goddamn words to save her life. All she can do is suck dick. She’ll be lucky if anyone will want the corn husk of her shell after she’s popped out a few unplanned kids. That may be mean, but she’s stupid and she deserves to remain stupid. Or that nice homosexual boy, said that being a manager was his only dream in the world other than his boyfriend? He’ll be lucky if a small town like this doesn’t lynch him. He can be nice all he wants, but when he acts like that, then we’ll people don’t like that. Those people’s transgressions will come back to them and they’ll feel it one way or the other.”\n\n“I guess so. What time do you go to work?”\n\n“I leave at around seven. It’s enough time to read and to get  shower.” He walks into the bathroom and Lily can hear the shower head ignite.\n\nShe finishes the beer and tosses the bottle into the trash can. She returns to her work, and then a knock from the door. She answers. “Yes?”\n\n“Hi, can I come in?”\n\n“No Kyle. You cannot. Please leave and don’t speak to me again.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\nShe places a hand on her hip. “I don’t want to see you again. That’s all you need to know.”\n\n“I deserve more than that, sweetie.”\n\n“Fuck off.” She shuts the door in his face. \n\nKyle remains on the porch in front of the door. He sees a robin’s nest on the ground and steps on an eggshell. He opens the car door and slams it. The transmission sputters as he accelerates away.\n\nLily returns to her work and rubs her temples. She massages a loose strand of hair into a small knot and then untangles it. Her father emerges from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist and searches through the dryer.  He walks off into his bedroom and dresses. When he returns, the towel looks like a small wash rag in his leathery hands as he scrubs his hair, a practice that has lead to his need for a wig. \n",

    "passage": "Clifford Thornton\n\nCLIFFORD EDWARD THORNTON III (September 6, 1936 – November 25, 1989) was an American jazz trumpeter, trombonist, activist, and educator. He played free jazz and avant-garde jazz in the 1960s and '70s.\n\n\nCareer\n\nClifford was born in Philadelphia. The year of his birth has been reported as early as 1934 or as late as 1939. He briefly attended Morgan State University and Temple University. Jazz pianist Jimmy Golden was his uncle,[1] while his cousin, drummer J. C. Moses, had a jazz career that was cut short by failing health. Clifford began piano lessons when he was seven-years-old.[2] Several biographers report that Clifford studied with trumpeter Donald Byrd during 1957,[3] after Byrd had left Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, and also that he worked with 17-year-old tuba player Ray Draper and Webster Young.[4] Following a late 1950s stint in the U.S. Army bands[5] Thornton moved to New York City.\n\nClifford's political and musical motivations are epitomized by his statement: “For a lot of brothers like myself, we got no choice. What else can we do in this world that's not a slave job? Really, what are our options? We have to be creative musicians if we want to be somebody in this world.”[6]\n\nIn the early 1960s, Clifford lived in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn in an apartment building with other young musicians, including Rashied Ali, Marion Brown, and Don Cherry.[7] He performed with numerous avant-garde jazz bands, appearing as a sideman on records by notable artists Sun Ra, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, and Sam Rivers; many of whom were affected by the compositional ideas of Cecil Taylor. In the January 1976 _Black World/Negro Digest_, Ron Welburne states that during this period Clifford had been active in the Black Arts Movement,[8] associated with Amiri Baraka and Jayne Cortez. This musical and artistic network provided him with a variety of perspectives on ideas such as black self-determination, performance forms, outside playing, and textural rhythm; it also gave him access to performers who would provide the abilities some of his later compositions required. He was included in the dialogue around the developing thought of political artists, including Shepp, Askia M. Touré, and Nathan Hare, as well as the journals _Freedomways_ and _Umbra_.\n\nEarly albums\n\nThornton's interest in composition eventually became the focus of his musical career. He had worked with Marzette Watts on the latter's first recording sessions; Watts credited Clifford's organizational skills and management of the group dynamics with the success of the sessions in achieving their goals.[9]\n\nThornton's first album, _Freedom & Unity_ (1967), was recorded the day after John Coltrane's funeral.[10] The ensemble included Karl Berger, Coltrane associate Jimmy Garrison, and the first recorded appearance of Joe McPhee.[11] It also included Edward and Harold “Nunding” Avent, a black activist who a year later was suspected of being an informant and provocateur for the FBI.[12] Of the ten songs, only the twenty-second-long “Kevin” is credited to Thornton. Archie Shepp and Ornette Coleman both wrote liner notes for the album. In the AllMusic review, Rob Ferrier says: “As Albert Ayler and Archie Shepp hearkened back to field hollers and very basic folk forms, musicians like Clifford Thornton went in the opposite direction, building on the music of the sophisticates and expanding the possibilities for jazz.”[13]\n\nThornton was invited with Shepp to perform in Algiers for the 1969 Pan-African Cultural Festival of the Organization for African Unity. This visit had an important impact on his developing political thought,[14] and he claimed that it helped to integrate his musical and political aims. The next month he was in Paris, and over an eleven-day period at BYG Actuel he recorded five albums, including _Ketchaoua_, his second album as leader and first with his own compositions. In October a Thornton-led group performed at the Actuel Festival in Amougies, Belgium.[15] At this early European pop and jazz festival (which claimed Woodstock as an inspiration and included performances by Pink Floyd, MEV, and a Frank Zappa/Archie Shepp jam-session) Clifford got to hear and work with a number of young free-jazz artists from Chicago.[16]\n\nIn November he was back in Paris as a sideman on Archie Shepp's albums _Black Gypsy_ and _Pitchin Can_. He continued to work in France through the next year, recording in July 1970 with Shepp, and completing his own album _The Panther and the Lash_ in early November. During this two-year period, Thornton worked with many European free jazz musicians, as well as growing his network of contacts to embrace Americans who had not been in the early-'60s New York scene, such as Chicago musicians Joseph Jarman, Malachi Favors, and Anthony Braxton). Thornton also established political and intellectual connections to _avant-garde_ artists and musicians, including Frederic Rzewski, Philip Glass, and Richard Teitelbaum. During that period he also commenced a relationship with Cristine Jakob.\n\nTeaching\n\nIn 1968, music instructor Ken McIntyre recommended Thornton as a candidate for Assistant Professor in world music at Wesleyan University. He was hired in 1969; this position gave him the security to travel to Africa and France. His tenure ran through 1975; during that period he brought many of his network of jazz musicians as Artists-in-Residence on campus, giving the academic world-music community more exposure to current American music. Among those artists were Sam Rivers, Jimmy Garrison, Ed Blackwell, and Marion Brown. He arranged performances at Wesleyan by Rashied Ali, Horace Silver, McCoy Tyner and many other jazz musicians. In addition, he included other artists from the world music program on his recordings, such as Milton Cardona, Abraham Konbena Adzenyah, Pandit Laxmi Ganesh Tewari, and Lakshminarayana Shankar), and introduced them to his fellow African-American performers.\n\nWhile at Wesleyan, he recorded the 1972 pastiché album _Communications Network_ (side one with Sirone and Shankar, side two backing Jayne Cortez, and both engineered by Marzette Watts). He also began writing for the _Gardens of Harlem_ album.\n\nComposing\n\nThornton's earliest recordings as a composer and arranger are found on Marzette Watts's eponymous 1966 record.[17] Most works recorded with his own name as leader were large-form compositions.[18] He used as many as eight performers on the ten recordings, and their length runs from the eight-minute “Pan-African Festival” to the twenty-five-minute “Festivals and Funerals” on the album _Communications Network_ (1972). He included shorter pieces by his collaborators on the albums, as well as his arrangements of traditional African pieces. _The Gardens of Harlem_ (1974) was developed as a project of the Jazz Composer's Orchestra during 1972–'74, and was revised twice before the twenty-five-person recording was done in April 1974.[19] It was released in 1975.\n\nAbout _The Gardens of Harlem_ Clifford wrote: “The challenge of writing for and working with large, ensembles has always interested me. My first influences in this direction as a child were the big bands of Basie, Eckstine, Gillespie, Machito and Puente. Later, I had the good fortune of working with the orchestras of Sun Ra, Bill Dixon, Sam Rivers, Archie Shepp and the JCOA. The spiritual and psychological fulfillment resulting from re-establishing the relationship with the traditional ethos...serves chiefly as a balance between the inner-self and the environment. This is, in part, the role and function of music in traditional African societies and among peoples of primarily African derivation. In this connection, music is vital to both religious and secular life for the same reasons and is manifested in the same ways. It is the core and foundation, the language of both religious and philosophic thought.”[20]\n\nThornton was widely perceived in the media as owning radical political leanings and connections with leading figures of the Black Panther Party; he is supposed to have met Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver during the Pan-African Cultural Festival in 1969, and claims have been made that he was a BPP Minister for Art. He was denied entry into France in 1970, reportedly[21] for a speech he made either at that year's Juan-les-Pins Jazz Festival or at Mutualite Hall in Paris;[22] the ban was lifted in 1971.[23][24] Because of this interruption, Thornton was unable to continue performing and recording in Paris.\n\nIn 1976, Clifford accepted a position with UNESCO's International Bureau of Education to be an educational counselor on African-American education;[25] he spent the remainder of his life in Geneva, Switzerland. He remained active musically; he led a performance in 1977 at Willisau, Lucerne, Switzerland, did two recordings in Austria with Anthony Braxton in 1977 and '78,[26] and was featured on a 1980 record with a group led by former Dollar Brand reedman and South African exile Joe Malinga.\n\nSeveral of Thornton's musician contemporaries claim his music influenced them. The most notable are likely Joe McPhee (who owns Thornton's valve trombone), Marzette Watts, and Bill Cole. Younger musicians affected by Clifford's musical thought include Fred Ho, Hajj Daoud Haroon,[27] George Starks,[28] Ras Moshe Burnett,[29] Peter Zummo, and Marie Incontrera. A number of musicians and educators also directly benefitted from being part of Thornton's network, among them Marion Brown, Ed Blackwell, Rashied Ali, Jimmy Garrison, Sam Rivers, and Lakshminarayana Shankar.\n\nThornton can be heard on only a small number of recordings that are now difficult to find. Still, thirty (or perhaps thirty-five) years after his demise, Clifford's work remains highly regarded by critics such as Thurston Moore,[30] author Philippe Carles, and Jazz.com's Sean Singer.[31]\n\n\nDiscography\n\nAs leader\n\n-   1967: _Freedom & Unity_ (Third World/Unheard Music Series) with Karl Berger, Jimmy Garrison, John McCortney, Joe McPhee, Don Moore\n-   1969: _Ketchaoua_ (BYG Actuel) with Dave Burrell, Claude Delcloo (de), Earl Freeman (de), Beb Guérin, Arthur Jones, Grachan Moncur III, Sunny Murray, Archie Shepp\n-   1970: _The Panther and the Lash_ with François Tusques (fr), Beb Guérin, Noel McGhie\n-   1972: _Communications Network_ (Third World) with Jerome Cooper, Jayne Cortez, Nathan Davis, Jerry Gonzalez, Jay Hoggard, L.

    "passage": "Tajchy\n\nTAJCHY (singular: tajch, from German _Teich_) are artificial water reservoirs in the Štiavnica Mountains, in central Slovakia. Most of them were built in order to provide energy for the silver mines of Banská Štiavnica in the 18th century. At their height, tajchy comprised a sophisticated system of 60 reservoirs, connected to each other by more than 100 km of channels and tunnels.[1] [Počúvadlo Lake is one of the preserved tajchy]\n\n24 artificial lakes still exist and serve recreational purposes. Because of their historical value, tajchy were proclaimed by the UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site on 11 December 1993, together with the town of Banská Štiavnica and technical historical monuments in its surroundings.[2]\n\n\nOperation\n\nThe region of Banská Štiavnica lacks significant sources of flowing surface water. That is why tajchy were designed to store water derived from precipitation. Channels with the overall length of 72 km diverted water from the rain and melting snow to sixty reservoirs.[3] The whole system could accumulate 7 million m³ of water.[4] The water then flowed through 57 km of channels to water wheels, which powered seven pumps equipped with a pendulum-action system. The pumps removed excess groundwater from mines and the water wheels later also provided energy for mining, processing, metallurgy, and mills.[5]\n\n\nHistory\n\n[Tajchy became crucial for development of Banská Štiavnica] Banská Štiavnica was an important medieval mining center, producing mostly silver. The first water reservoirs were founded by the local miners in the 15th century.[6] However, the most significant development of tajchy was precipitated by a crisis in the mining industry in the 17th century. The depth of the mines' shafts started to reach below the level of the drainage tunnels. As a result, mines were flooded by ground water. The draining mechanisms of that period were powered by human or animal power, which was too expensive. Due to the prohibitive costs, the Royal Court Chamber in Vienna decided to close the mines in Banská Štiavnica and its surroundings. A mining expert and inventor Jozef Karol Hell challenged the decision, submitting a courageous proposal to rescue mining in his home town. An innovative plan based on the use of tajchy was finally endorsed by Emperor Charles VI.[7]\n\nIn the 18th century, tajchy gradually expanded into a complicated system of lakes and channels, designed by three famous engineers: Jozef Karol Hell, his father Maximilian Hell, and especially Jozef's teacher Samuel Mikovíny. The project was technically and economically demanding. For example, construction of two Richňava tajchy required the work of 4,000 people working every day for three years (1738–1740).[8] But after their completion, tajchy proved capable of draining all the water from the flooded mines and they even provided enough energy for other booming industries.\n\nThe renewed prosperity resulted in great economic and cultural development of Banská Štiavnica.[9] In 1782, Banská Štiavnica (Selmecbánya) was the third biggest town in the Kingdom of Hungary (with 23,192 or including suburbs 40,000 inhabitants), after Bratislava (Pozsony) and Debrecen. In 1762, Queen Maria Theresa ordered the establishment of a Mining Academy in Banská Štiavnica, creating the first technical university in the world.[10] The town was chosen “because it had mining, hydrological, metallurgical, propulsion, and testing equipment as well as fire, water and air devices, and pendulum-action drainage devices which did not exist in other mining locations,” in other words because of its tajchy.[11] Tajchy were also praised by their royal visitors, including Francis I, Joseph II, and Leopold II.[12]\n\n\nWater reservoirs\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, the three tallest dams in Europe built for the mining industry had been tajchy in Slovakia: Rozgrund (30.2 m), Počúvadlo (29.6 m), and Veľká Richňava (23.4 m). In the same period, 7 out of 13 European mining water reservoirs with the biggest volume of water were tajchy.[13] After several centuries, tajchy became an integral part of their natural environment. Several of the dams have been recently reconstructed. Some of the reservoirs are heavily frequented by tourists, while other, usually smaller lakes lie hidden in the forests of the Štiavnica Mountains.\n\nThe largest lake is Počúvadeľské jazero (or Počúvadlo) with an area of 12.13 hectares and a depth of 11 m.[14] The volume is 745,000 m³. The main dam is 195 m long and 19 m thick.[15] Tourist infrastructure makes Počúvadlo the most popular of all tajchy.[16]\n\nVeľká Richňavská nádrž (or Veľká Richňava) has a dam 569 m long, 23.4 m high, and 23 m thick. This tajch is characterized by the largest depth (21 m) and volume (960,000 m³).[17] It supplies Štiavnické Bane with water and also serves for recreation.\n\nRozgrund was the highest earthen dam in Czechoslovakia until the second half of the 20th century. The reservoir supplies the town of Banská Štiavnica with drinking water.[18]\n\nList of all preserved reservoirs\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------\n  -   Bakomi reservoir in Štiavnické Bane                 |\n  -   Belianske reservoir in Banská Belá                  \n  -   Červená studňa reservoir in Banská Štiavnica        -   Michalstolniansky reservoir in Banská Štiavnica\n  -   Evička reservoir in Štiavnické Bane                 -   Moderstolna reservoir in Kopanice\n  -   Goldfuss reservoir in Banská Belá                   -   Ottergrund reservoir in Banská Štiavnica\n  -   Halčianske reservoir in Banská Belá                 -   Počúvadlo reservoir in Počúvadlo\n  -   Klinger reservoir in Banská Štiavnica               -   Rozgrund reservoir in Banská Štiavnica\n  -   Kolpašsky small reservoir in Banský Studenec        -   Richňavské velke jazero in Štiavnické Bane\n  -   Kolpašsky big reservoir in Banský Studenec          -   Richňava small reservoir in Štiavnické Bane\n  -   Krechsengrund reservoir in Štiavnické Bane          -   Štampoch reservoir in Vysoká\n  -   Kysihyblianské reservoirs in Banský Studenec        -   Vindšachta big reservoir in Štiavnické Bane\n  -   Lintich reservoir (destroyed) in Banská Štiavnica   -   Vodárenska big reservoir in Banská Štiavnica\n                                                          -   Vodárenska small reservoir in Banská Štiavnica\n                                                          -   Hodrusa upper reservoir in Banská Hodruša\n                                                          -   Hodrusa lower reservoir in Banská Hodrusa\n                                                          -   Komorovske upper and lower reservoirs in Banská Štiavnica\n                                                          -   Banky reservoir in Banská Štiavnica\n  ------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n",

    "passage": "Making Heap fast is a unique and particularly difficult adventure in performance engineering. Our customers run hundreds of thousands of queries per week and each one is unique. What’s more, our product is designed for rich, ad hoc analyses, so the resulting SQL is unboundedly complex.\n\nFor some background, Heap is a tool for analyzing customer interactions. We gather data from web, iOS, android, and a growing list of third-party tools such as Stripe and Salesforce, and provide a simple UI our customers can use to query that data.\n\nA core concept in our product is the idea of an “event definition”, which is a mapping between a human-level event like “Signup” or “Checkout” and what that event means in terms of raw clicks. This layer of indirection between the concept being analyzed and the underlying data makes the product very powerful and easy to use: you can add a new event definition and run an analysis over all of your historical data, as if you had been tracking “Signups” since you first installed the product. But it comes at a cost: EVERYTHING WE DO BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS IS IN TERMS OF A DYNAMIC SCHEMA THAT ISN’T FULLY KNOWN UNTIL READ TIME. Handling this indirection at all is its own fascinating topic.\n\nTo execute a query, we take the query expressed in the UI, compile it to SQL, inline the event definitions, and then run the resulting SQL query across a cluster of PostgreSQL instances. This process can easily result in incredibly hairy SQL queries. As an example, consider this “simple” query, graphing daily unique users who view a blog post, broken down by their initial referrer:\n\n[]\n\nThis analysis is about as simple as it gets, and yet it produces this hairy SQL query:\n\nThe queries only become more complicated as they make use of the more powerful features we support. A query can include filters on the number of times a user has done a given event in an arbitrary time range as well as break down the results by multiple different fields simultaneously. For example, we might want to filter the above for users who had never seen a blog post before, or for users who later viewed our pricing page, or break down the above query by the specific blog post viewed in addition to the initial referrer of the user viewing the blog post. This isn’t even getting into any of our other query types such as funnels (measuring the conversion rate between a series of events) or retention (calculating a table showing, of users who did event X, what percentage of users did event Y after 1 week, 2 weeks, etc). Each additional part of the query only makes the SQL more complicated.\n\nOur product is designed for ad hoc, interactive analysis, as opposed to pre-canned dashboards, so IN ADDITION TO BEING COMPLEX, THESE QUERIES ARE TYPICALLY UNIQUE as well. Furthermore, since we shard our data by customer, any query run by customer A will touch a completely disjoint dataset from any query run by customer B. This makes comparing queries between two customers a fool’s errand since the datasets for those two customers are completely different. Making this kind of product fast is an incredibly difficult challenge. How are we even supposed to determine where we should be focusing our attention to best improve query performance?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the company was small, we did this by having an engineer go through a sample of slow queries, and rerun them with EXPLAIN ANALYZE. EXPLAIN ANALYZE is a Postgres feature that shows how Postgres executed the query, how much time was spent executing each part of the query, as well as some additional execution information. The engineer would write up a summary explaining why the queries were slow and how they could be improved.\n\nThere were two main issues with this approach. First of all, AN ENGINEER WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A SMALL NUMBER OF THE SLOW QUERIES. Analyzing these queries one at a time meant that an engineer could go through a few dozen queries at most in an afternoon. This is an extremely small sample of all of the queries we run each week, and is likely to miss issues unless they are very common.\n\nSecond, WHAT CAUSED A QUERY TO BE SLOW MAY NOT BE REPRODUCIBLE AFTER THE FACT. This can happen for a variety of reasons. The query could have been slow due to intermittent high load, or the plan Postgres uses to execute the query can change due to updated table statistics or a number of other reasons. Quite often, we would come across queries that had been slow, but we were unable to come up with an explanation for why.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter realizing how ineffective this “whack-a-mole” performance engineering approach was, we tried to design a better way. What we really wanted was some way we could collect enough information for every query as we initially ran it, such that we can always determine why a query was slow. As it turns out, we did manage to find a way to do that with Postgres.\n\nPostgres provides an extension called auto_explain. When enabled, auto_explain automatically logs the query plan and execution information for every query as it’s run. It’s exactly like EXPLAIN ANALYZE, but automatically records the information for every query as it happens. Depending on how auto_explain is configured, you can obtain some or all of the following information:\n\n-   How the query was executed.\n-   How long it took to execute each part of the query.\n-   How many rows were returned by each part of the query.\n-   How many pages were read from disk or from cache from each part of the query.\n-   How much time was spent performing I/O in each part of the query.\n\nTHIS IS AN ABSOLUTE GOLD MINE OF INFORMATION FOR ANALYZING WHY QUERIES ARE SLOW. Importantly, all of this information is gathered as the query is run, so we do not run into issues where a slow query is not reproducible, since we no longer need to reproduce the slowness in order to determine why the query was slow. Even better, auto_explain has the option to obtain the output in JSON. This makes it easy to programmatically analyze the query plans.\n\nTo gather all of this information, we wrote a short job that tails our Postgres logs and watches for any Postgres plans. When the job sees a query plan, it sends the plan information to a separate Postgres instance. With all of this information gathered in one place we can easily ask all sorts of questions.\n\nSince we now have the query plan for every single query that was ever executed in Heap, we no longer have this issue of trying to debug a slow query that is no longer slow. On top of that, WE CAN NOW RUN ANALYSES GET A SENSE FOR WHAT CAUSES QUERIES TO BE SLOW IN AGGREGATE.\n\nSome of the questions we had and were able to answer with this data were:\n\n-   WHAT PERCENTAGE OF QUERIES OVER TEN SECONDS SPENT MORE THAN TEN SECONDS PERFORMING AN INDEX SCAN THAT RETURNED MORE THAN 10,000 ROWS? This is looking for queries that had to read a lot of data from disk due to an event that occurred often.¹\n-   WHAT PERCENTAGE OF QUERIES OVER TEN SECONDS SPENT MORE THAN TEN SECONDS PERFORMING AN ON-DISK SORT? An on-disk sort occurs when a Postgres process does not have enough memory allocated to sort the data in memory so it sorts the data on disk which is significantly slower.\n-   WHAT PERCENTAGE OF QUERIES OVER TEN SECONDS SPENT MORE THAN TEN SECONDS READING FROM THE `PAGEVIEWS` INDEX OR THE `SESSIONS` INDEX? Session and pageview events are two commonly queried events as, well as two of the most frequent raw events. This makes them a common cause of slow queries.\n\nWE ALSO USED THIS INFORMATION TO COME UP WITH A FAIRLY EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF ROOT CAUSES OF SLOW QUERIES. We did so by picking a random slow query, figuring out why it was slow, and then determine exactly how many queries were slow for the same reason. Then we filtered out that cause of slow queries and analyzed the remaining, unexplained slow queries. By doing this repeatedly, WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY >90% OF SLOW QUERIES ARE SLOW.\n\nWhat’s more, we can track how these rates change over time, and prioritize work accordingly. A lot of these causes will require multi-month engineering efforts to resolve, so it is critical that we know upfront how much the overall impact will be on our query performance.\n\nFor example, we knew via anecdote that our time-based user segment feature commonly causes on-disk sorts. With this kind of analysis, we were able to determine what percentage of slow queries came from this feature _and_ were slow due to an on-disk sort. This turned out to be less common than we expected, and we deprioritized the work to invest in making this kind of query avoid on-disk sorts in favor of another query performance project.\n\nWe’ve found auto_explain to be an amazing tool for determining the causes of slow queries. It allows us to automatically collect detailed performance information about every single query as it executes. We can then use this information to determine how frequent different causes of slow queries are and prioritize what changes we should be working on.\n\nAfter combing through all of the data, we decided to make use of table partitioning to improve query performance. By partitioning out session and pageview events, we can dramatically improve the performance of queries that require reading large amounts of sessions or pageviews. According to the data we’ve gathered from auto_explain, this directly addresses ~25% of all slow queries.\n\nIf all of this sounds interesting to you, Heap is hiring so please apply. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at @mmalisper.\n\n[1] This is 10,000 rows from a single shard. Since our data is heavily sharded, 10,000 rows is a lot more data than it sounds.\n",

    "passage": "[RF] Lose/Lose\n\nAdam woke up the way he did every day.  Rolling over to see himself patiently sitting on his desk across the room, smirking.\n\n“Good morning, sleeping beauty,” the shade said to him.\n\nAdam’s reply was a simple sigh before getting up, the shade immediately taking its place behind him, watching over his shoulder.  He used to reply but over time, he realized the shade wouldn’t listen, no matter how much he spoke or how loud he was.\n\n“I hate it when you sleep, Adam.  I don’t get to speak to you when you sleep.  Instead I have to talk to myself until you wake up.  Do you realize just how ironic that is, Adam?  Doubtful.  You don’t understand a lot of things.  What I can’t understand is how you got into college.  After all, you’re lazy and stupid and have no marketable skills.  At least no girl has fallen for the same trick the college did, whatever that was.  That way you can’t drag some poor girl down with you.”\n\nThat was a daily part of his routine.  Abuse from himself the entire morning.  The topic of conversation was unemployment during his shower, his romantic life (or lack thereof) while he ate, his personality while he brushed his teeth, and during his walk to class he abused himself in whatever manner was most convenient at the time.  Today, the topic was his future.\n\n“Why did you get up today?  You’re stuck with me until you freeze to death in the back of your car.  No matter what you do today, you’re doomed to failure.”  Adam stared down at the bridge underneath him as he walked along towards his class.  He lived in an apartment on campus that was included in the scholarship he got after high school.  His grades weren’t extraordinarily high but they were high enough to bring the college expenses down to enough for his mother to afford.\n\n“You could jump right now, you know.”  Adam’s feet slid to a halt and stared at his feet for a long moment before casting a sideways glance over the edge at the busy road under the bridge.  “You’d save a lot of people a lot of trouble.  You’re fully aware of that.  All it would take is one little jump. There’s even a semi coming along.  Time it right and you could make sure you don’t walk away from it.”\n\nThe cars under the bridge went screaming down the highway that divided the campus in two.  Anything that fell off the bridge would have maybe three seconds to live after going over the edge, then they’d become a fine mist in the air and a small gore stain on the road.\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder and the shade fell silent.\n\n“More people watching?”\n\nAdam turned around and his suspicions were confirmed.  It was Jessi, a sophomore girl that he met through his History class.  She was a short, slim girl with blonde, shoulder-length hair and high cheek bones and a gaunt face structure.  Adam had caught other guys paying more attention to her than the instructor more often than not.  He found himself thinking on more than one occasion that he might’ve found her attractive if not for the fact that she was a little bit on the ditzy side.  They didn’t spend a whole lot of time together, but they usually walked to class together in the morning since they were heading in the same direction anyways.\n\n“Yeah, Jess.  People are strange,” Adam replied to her with no tells in his voice to betray his true intentions.  “It’s always fun to watch how people react to being cut off, especially.”\n\nShe giggled just a little.  “How many birds so far?”\n\n“Birds?”\n\n“Yeah.  Y’know.”  She held up her fist and extended a middle finger.  “Birds.”\n\n“Oh, uhm…”  He looked back down at traffic and quickly pulled a number out of the air.  “Two so far.  Well, I guess three, but two were from the same person… at once… not the best of ideas, actually.”\n\nShe giggled again and looked at her phone.  “C’mon, we need to get to class.”  She bounced on the balls of her feet and walked off towards the campus, getting a few steps before realizing Adam wasn’t following.  “You coming?”\n\nHe shook his head and looked up.  “Hm?  Oh, yeah I’m coming.”\n\nShe tilted her head.  “Something wrong?”\n\nThe shade rested his hand on Adam’s shoulder.  “Don’t bother her with your issues, Adam.  She’s so happy, all the time.  Don’t take that from her.  She’s lucky.”\n\n“Na, I’m fine.”  He called back, forcing a smile.  She seemed to accept it pretty well, turning around and doing her half-walk, half-bounce to class.  He followed after her and they attended a class where they learned about the French Revolution, which was being taught by a professor that they theorized knew so much about it because he was still alive when it happened.\n\nThe class couldn’t end fast enough.  Lunch finally came along to silence the old man’s ramblings and everyone grabbed up their things and started the shuffle towards that door, one or two people, as always, taking just a little too long in the doorway.  As soon as they were all out the door, Adam and his shade watched Jessi walk up to a tall, muscular guy with a camo shirt, blue jeans, and cowboy boots that was waiting outside the door.  Knowing Jessi and all the rumors about her, Adam assumed that he’d see that guy again in the hallway, tonight, headed towards her apartment.\n\nHe didn’t think too much about it, though.  Jessi’s life wasn’t his and she could live it how she wanted to.  He finally went to the campus food court and found where his circle of friends all gathered every day.  The circle of friends was decently sized, but people came and went all the time.  When he showed up, Thomas, Sammy, and Ed were having a debate over zombies.\n“My issue with zombie films isn’t that there’s so many, it’s that they’re so inconsistent.  In one film, they’re made by voodoo, in another they’re made by a virus.  What even is a zombie anymore?”  Thomas was getting into the debate and it made the ghost of a smile creep across his face.\n\nThe three greeted him when he sat down and then right back into the heated discussion.  Adam didn’t have many friends growing up.  In fact, he had very little.  Back in Elementary and Middle School he got bullied a lot.  He grew jaded to it, and got used to being without friends, so having a group of people around was a new experience to him and he had no clue how to socialize.  But then again, the group was so odd and diverse he didn’t really have to act any certain way.  They were pretty accepting of him and his odd personality.\n\nHe still noticed, though, that they spoke to each other more than they spoke to him.  Each day he found it just a little bit harder to interject into conversation.  Finally, he just stopped trying to begin with.  He sat silently on his laptop, thankful that at least their conversation was interesting enough to keep the shade silent.\n\n“Adam, what’s with the bags under your eyes?”\n\nHe looked up to see Sammy looking at him with his head cocked to the side.\n\n“I haven’t been sleeping well.  I lay down and then just stare at the ceiling for a while instead of going right to sleep.”\n\n“Is something bothering you to keep him up at night?”\n\nOnly your miserable, pitiful, meaningless existence, He said in his head.\n\n“No, I just can’t sleep.  It happens sometimes.  I’ll be alright.”  That was a lie and he knew it.  Sam might of known it too, but if he did, he didn’t press the issue.  The other Adam smiled because he loved it when Adam pushed people away.\n\nAdam’s next mistake was to zone out.  He got lost in his laptop and stopped hearing the people around him.  The shade immediately took this chance to talk to him.  Tell him how pathetic he was and make sure he knew that no one around him was paying attention to him.  The shade told him it was because no one truly cared and wouldn’t miss him if he was gone.\nHe opened up his grades and sighed.  They were still slipping further and further down.  The shade tormented him on that.  He went to his social media account and he saw everything that his friends were up to.  The shade told him to look at how happy his friends were without him around.  He tried to play a game, his laptop crashed to the desktop.  He looked up, desperate to stop the shade talking to him but no one let him into the conversation.  Silently, he stood up and packed his laptop case up, then slung it over his shoulder and left with a small, “Goodbye.”\n\n“Adam, where are you headed?”\n\n“Gotta go take care of something,” he said in a tone that left no suspicions.\n\n“Alright, take care, man.”\n\nHe walked back to the bridge that loomed over the highway and looked around.  There was a natural break in the scheduling that meant that everyone at this point was always wherever they were going to be for the next couple hours, so traffic between the campus and the student housing was minimal.  No one was around at the time except for himself, who wouldn’t stop talking to him.  “Good boy. Up, on the ledge.  Don’t want anyone coming along and trying to call the police on you again.”\n\nOne time before he was dumb enough to mention his intentions to a friend who proceeded to call the police.  The friend didn’t help, nor did the police.  They just told him to keep living, gave him no reason, called him selfish, and then stopped talking to him after he assured everyone that he was fine.\n\nHe stepped up on the ledge and stared down.  His heavy heart was tugging him downwards.  He looked up at the sky and saw the clouds.  A light breeze moved his hair and he smiled.  It was a lovely day to die.\n\nEverything started to get thrown at him by the shade.  His entire life.  He was on the ledge and the other him was going to use everything he could to make him fall.  That’s when Adam realized there were three of him.\n\nThere was the one on the ledge.  The one that was done.  The one that had given up.  Then there was another him that was wanting someone to come along.  A part of him that had hope that someone would see him and save him.  Then there was the one that threw insults at him.  The one who wanted him here and would physically push him off if he could.  They all shared the same body, and they all fought for control.  Sadly, the one who wanted him dead had won.  He was the dominant Adam.  He was the strongest Adam.  He’d gotten the Adam that had control of their body to agree with him and outvoted the one that had hope.\nNow all three were staring down at busy traffic, ready to end things.\n\n“Your grades are slipping, you have no one around to love you, your father hates you, and you’re a burden to your poor mother.  Your friends don’t need you.  No one wants you around, Adam.  Take the last step.”\n\nAdam let out a growl.  He wasn’t jumping out of the fear of those things.  He was jumping before it got worse.  Right now, things were tolerable, but he didn’t see anything getting better.  It was over in his mind.  Now it was time to make sure that miserable future never happened.  With that, he cast out his foot and started to tilt forward.  As soon as his balance shifted forwards past the point of no return, he heard a voice.  “No!”  He turned his head in time to see a panicked Jesse sprinting towards him but too far away to make it on time.\n\nThe sounds of traffic blared under him.  He silently apologized to the person whose car would be unlucky enough to catch him.  He looked down and felt like he was falling forever, when it was really closer to three or four seconds.  He saw the asphalt running up to greet him and heard the car horns blare when they saw him.",

    "passage": "Forever Agony, Forever Silent (horror short story, feedback wanted)\n\n  My eyes opened suddenly, my heart raced in my ears, a panic brought from the depths of a dream ending. Something was watching me, I felt it in that subhuman part of my brain that we all have, that animal instinct that told us of danger unseen. Something was watching from those dark recesses of my room, those corners that held shadow just so perfectly to invite the imagination to cast horrors unknowable. And so my heart races as my eyes scanned the room that I knew so well, the room that held me safe against all things.  \n  \n  Eyes do not see entirely correctly when they are suddenly forced out of REM sleep and back into reality. Things are distorted, a haze that shrouds things for the briefest moments of time. They bring with them the fragments of dreams and force them into reality, but they aren’t quite there, so as I peered into the darkness that blanketed my room, I saw things that weren’t there.\n\n  Yet something lay there, watching with eyes unseen. My heart raced still, drumming endlessly in my ears. What intention did it have, whatever it might be? My left over animal side knew of danger, but my human brain questioned. Did it want to watch me in my most vulnerable of moments, knowing that it could end me without a fight? Or did it want something worse? \n\n  And then my eyes beheld something I wanted to believe came from the remainder of my dream, but I knew it was not. A grim visage indeed, the outline of a man that wasn’t a man, some dark mockery of our form cast in that forbidding gloom and I knew it was staring at me. \n \n  The head was too pale, I saw as my eyes slowly began to adjust, and utterly without features except for two eyes and a mouth, though they weren’t quite right. They eyes were pits, swirling pools of void that drew in the darkness around it. The mouth opened, splitting decayed lips and revealing the same void that were its eyes. My ears were assaulted with the sound of rushing air and groaning metal, the sound of screams from every thing that ever existed, all pleading out for mercy that they would never receive from a master that didn’t know the concept. \n\n  And then silence…\n\n  All sound stopped, every background sound that our ears adjust to over the years of living in a time of constant noise, including the drumming of our own hearts and the rush of our blood, stopped. The true silence fell on my ears and threatened my mind with madness, maybe even more so than the sight of the thing before me. \n\n  The darkness around the horror warped, distorted to conform to its shape, shimmering yet completely still at the same time like a ripple moving through the surface of calm water. The head moved in a way unnatural, like the still frames of a strobe light, one moment leaning left and the next right. \n\n  Arms as pale as the head reached out toward me, and my fear grew a hundredfold, as razor wire, corroded by time and blood, seethed from the curve of the elbow and began crawling to cover them. They snake around those too pale arms and squeezed, bleeding that void made liquid from every inch, yet the blood refused to fall. Around the throat and across the torso it went, cutting deep to reveal not the fragility of a human form, but nothing. \n\n  I pleaded with my mind to wake me, that this must be some dream. Nothing like this could exist in truth, for this was a creature born of horror and shadow. Yet as that thing stared at me, and as the silence pressed on me, I knew it was no dream, that this was real. Somehow, at that moment, I knew this thing was ancient, that it had existed all along the course of our short time on the planet. That this was the real reason we feared darkness, and begged for the light. \n\n  The devil we fought against in every religion, the boogeyman we warned our children about, thinking it was some tradition that we all jokingly passed down. It was Hell, or The Abyss or the Inferno or Perdition, made real. \n\n  I realized I had lain back down, having jumped with a start to my elbows when I’d awoken. How long had I been lying down again? It hovered above me; razor ripped false skin not dripping on me. A leg on each side of my torso, or was it floating above me? The head twitched back and forth and those eyes cast upon mine, and I knew death in that moment. I felt the loneliness of Ninth Circle of Hell, the cold of the void, and the agony of a wrathful god. \n\n  It leaned down, ever closer, and I could smell it. The was the smell of the rotting flesh of one’s most beloved person, sulfur and frost, burning flesh and bile, rust and blood. My heart raced faster, and it pained me, a burning that spread too rapidly through my body, an agony that made me scream, but I found myself unable to open my mouth. Every inch of me begged to scream, and let my pain be known, but I found myself silent. \n\n  I don’t know how long I have been like this, screaming in silent agony, freezing and burning and weeping no tears, begging for the end of this nightmare that could not be. A hundred thousand years passed, each second passing just a little too slow, and I felt every moment of it, and yet no time past. And I know that this will be my everything, forever. \n\n  I’ve forgotten the warmth of another person’s touch, the embrace of a loved one, the feel of passionate lips on mine. The tastes of my favorite foods, the sound of my favorite band are all gone now. So too the feeling of a cool breeze at dusk on a hot day, even the simple joy of lying under a blanket in the depths of winter to read a book. My thoughts now are all the same, Let me die…\n\n  A million billion years of suffering every second, and every second too slow every minute never becoming two. \n \nLet me die…\nPlease…let me die…\n…end this.\n \n  But it never does quite end…it is always going on and on, all of time spread before me each moment a suffering. I sometimes wonder, now, what the man I used to be was like. I can no longer remember if that man, so long ago, was a happy man with a good life, or if I was reviled by those around me. Was I a funny man, cracking jokes all the time and able to get a room of people laughing? Was I sad with the things that brought to bed that night, whenever that last night in my bed was? \n\n  That horrible silence is always my answer, a harsh truth that makes my questions meaningless. Only those pits of swirling blackness matter, that soul destroying gaze. It knew me, far more than I knew myself, and every moment it chipped away at me, an endless march toward nonexistence, but the pain makes it seem preferable. I would join that nothingness in time, but not before every ounce of suffering could be pulled from me, and it was. \n\n …let me die. A plead that lingered unnoticed forever, an endless begging ignored. \n\n  My eyes opened suddenly, my heart raced in my ears, a panic brought from the depths of a dream ending. I did not know what woke me, be it my brain ejecting me from a dream it was finished with, or simply being rested. I scanned the room; parting the veil of sleep to discover my room empty, save for the darkness and myself. Outside I heard a car door close, no doubt my neighbor getting home from a midnight shift at the convenience store down the road. \n\n  Rolling over I reached out and found my phone, which I took and pressed the button on time to engage the too bright, too sudden light from the screen. The clock read five in the morning, but one would hardly know it. The sun hadn’t yet breached the horizon, nor did it show any signs of attempting it today.\n\n  That dream, that hell of an existence, remained in fragments, the entirety destroyed like the surface of a mirror. Hours and coffee would see it gone for good, as the rest of the day would greet me to bring me back to my life, a normal life of working a job I neither enjoyed nor detested. I rolled from my bed, placing feet to warm fuzzy rug, and yawned. \n\n  I found myself in the shower; warm beads of water beat down on my tensed muscles. I didn’t remember the act of getting in the shower, but I was thankful for the warmth. The news had said it would be another cold day, at best being as high as forty degrees Fahrenheit. My heater was broken in my car, and I still hadn’t gotten around to fixing it. \n\n  The rush of cold air as I stepped outside brought the remembrance of that horrible dream in portion.  I remember the feeling of floating through a cold too terrible to be real. I shook my head, trying to dispel it, it was only a dream. My jacket pulled tighter around my chest, I made my way to my car.\n\n  My neighbor greeted me from his lawn as he retrieved his trash can from the curb, a gesture made and returned every day. Nothing was special about this day, only the remnants of that dream. I felt a smile cross my face, knowing that everything was okay.\n\n  The sun shined down on my cold face, warming it for a moment, a perfectly normal yet sincere second of time that could exist only for those alive. The dead know not the feeling of warm sunshine, only cold dirt, and that was worth remembering. \n\n  My eyes opened suddenly, my heart raced in my ears, a panic brought from the depths of a dream ending. The silence contained the world in perfect stillness, and my tormentor’s unforgiving eyes greeted my suffering again. I thought I saw a gleam of sadistic pleasure in there, somewhere, buried deep beneath the existing nothingness. \n\n A moment of sincere joy, the simple feeling of warmth from the sun, was given to me as hope. And it was taken from me, reminding me of my true fate. \n\n …let me die. I begged through silent eyes, for no scream could pass my lips. \n\n …let this be the end, I’ve suffered enough. \n\n …Finish this, please. \n\n Somehow I knew it would never end. \n\n--Tommy Lawrence, 2013",

and can be viewed in its entirety on the Montana Republican Party website.[5]\n\n\nConventions\n\nAccording to Party Bylaws, conventions that are held within the state. The State Platform convention, which meets once every even-numbered year between the primary and general elections, the purpose of this convention, is to adopt a state platform. There is a State Delegate Convention, which meets every presidential year prior to the Republican National Committee; during this convention they elect the delegates and alternate delegates to the Republican National Convention. Then there is the State Officer's Convention, which meets in June each odd-numbered year, this is when the state chairman and state vice chairman are elected. These conventions are given notice by convention calls and they give notice to all meetings or conventions. There is a quorum for any business actions and are entitled to vote thereat, in person, or by proxy, and weighted votes are not considered. Proxies are allowed except when selecting delegates for the national convention. Voting is an individual basis and are only for people entitled to vote at the conventions. The Parliamentary practice is Roberts' Rules of Order, it governs all conventions and meetings and allows the State Chairman to appoint a parliamentarian for any State Central Committee meeting or convention.[6]\n\nCommittees\n\nState Central Committee is made up by the County Chairman, State committeemen and committee women, and Finance Chairman for each county. This committee is the governing body the Montana GOP and makes up all the rules and policies for the state party. State Executive Committee is made up of many members such as State Chairman, Vice Chairman, National committeeman and committeewoman, statewide elected federal and state officeholders, elected Republican Public Service Commissioners, the highest ranking Republican leader from state Senate and House of Representatives, and many other Republican groups or Clubs within Montana. The main purpose of this committee is to execute policies and programs of the Montana GOP between the State Central Committees. The terms of these members last as long as the Chairman's term and can also end by resignation or removal. County Central Committee is found in each county in Montana and only consists of elected or appointed committeemen and committeewomen from each precinct of the county and hold officer for two years. The committee elects County Chairman and Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer, State and Congressional committeeman and committee woman, Finance Chairman, and anything else that seems important. It can adopt its own rules and come up with a County Executive Committee that executes the counties rules and policies. There are also other committees such as the Rules Committee. The members are appointed by the Chairman and they consider or recommend rules and rule changes. Any other special committee such as the Rules Committee can be appointed by the Chairman if needed.[7]\n\nElected officers\n\nChairman is the leader of the Party and is responsible of the hiring and firing of any employees. The Chairman can appoint all committees except the Executive Committee. The Chairman has the power of supervision and management. The Chairman also works with the Treasurer to make sure the right resources are provided. Vice Chairman performs all the duties assigned by the Chairman. Secretary keeps the minutes for all meetings and anything assigned by the Chairman. Treasurer controls the financial record keeping and practices of the party. Assistant Treasurer is there to become familiar with the responsibilities of the Treasurer and will perform any duties assigned by the Chairman and Treasurer.[8]\n\nAppointed officers\n\nExecutive Director is appointed by the Chairman after approval from the Executive Committee. The main duty is to preserve all permanent records of the State Central Committee and any other duty assigned by the Chairman. Finance Chairman is appointed exactly like the Executive Director. The main duty of this officer is to raise funds for the Republican Party.\n\nGeneral Counsel is also appointed the same way as the first two officers. The main duty of the General Counsel is to advise the Chairman, State Central Committee, and all other officers and committees on all legal matters. The General Counsel is licensed to practice law within the state.\n\nThere can be other types of officers that are appointed by the Chairman. These types are only appointed if needed for a particular purpose.[9]\n\nNominations\n\nThe State Central Committee will appoint a nominee to fill a vacancy for a party candidate and the person who receives the most votes is the nominee. If one or two Congressional Districts for the state need to be filled, a committee appointed by the County Central Committee will make the appointment and the person with the most votes wins the nomination. The votes entitled to the certain members shall be weighted by comparing the Republican primary vote in each county and the Republican primary vote for the office being voted for. For each two percent or less of the total vote, there are four votes awarded to the county. Anything higher than two percent will be awarded an extra vote. The delegates at the meetings will divide the votes to each county and then the delegates will individually cast their votes.[10]\n\n\nVoting trends\n\n[Montana Presidential Election Results by County, 2008]\n\nMontana is considered to be a moderately Republican state.[11] There is a small percentage of Hispanic and African American votes. There is a significant number of votes from the Native American population as well.[12] In the last ten presidential elections Montana has voted Republican, except in 1992.[13] Republican presidential candidate John McCain won Montana in 2008 with 49.43% of the total statewide vote over Democrat Barack Obama who received 47.17%, a 2.4-percent margin of victory.\n\nAs of 2015/2016 the Montana Senate has a Republican majority with twenty-nine of the fifty seats and a majority in the Montana House of Representatives with fifty-nine of the one hundred seats.[14]\n\n\nHistorical figures\n\nBenjamin Potts\n\n[Benjamin F Potts] Potts was a Republican Governor of Montana Territory who worked with Democrat political and business leaders to sustain a successful program of financial responsibility and economy of government during a boom period in Montana's territorial era. He was the longest serving territorial governor in U.S. history.[15]\n\nWilbur F. Sanders\n\nSanders was a lawyer, Civil War veteran that was considered to be known as the essence of Montana Republicanism.[16]\n\nJeannette Rankin\n\n[Jeannette Rankin] Rankin was a Republican from Montana and was also an important figure with the women's suffrage movement. Her efforts were rewarded when Montana gave women the right to vote in 1914. In 1916 she was the first woman to be elected to Congress. During her term in Congress she voted against U.S. entry in World War I. She left Congress in 1919 but was reelected in 1940. Once again she voted for peace and opposed U.S. entry in World War II.[17]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] , Montana Republican Party Platform.\n\n[6] \n\n[7] , Montana Republican Party Bylaws.\n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] 1\n\n[12] 2\n\n[13] 3\n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] Hirshcmann, Kris. “Montana: The Treasure State”.

    "passage": "[FN] Skies Asunder\n\nThis is my take on the Norse myth of Thor's fishing trip with Hymir. Some liberties taken with the mythology. Enjoy. \n\nThe wind howled like a pack of wolves nipping and tearing at the cloak strewn over the shoulder of a large man striding along the coastal path. Tyr pulled his hood further over his eyes with his remaining hand to protect against the bite of the gale. As the cloak shifted and the wind attacked the mottled skin of his stump, Tyr was painfully reminded of the great beast that took it. Fenrir, the giant wolf, bound by the Aesir until the breaking of the world. Pale blue sky stretched overhead as he looked behind him, not a cloud in sight over the horizon. That day of reckoning would not arrive today, so he cast it from his thoughts. As Tyr once more turned into the frigid wind leaping at him from the north, he heard the air burst into the booming sound of a voice echoing from afar. The familiar chant of a raucous battle song, he realized, and in the distance he saw a lone figure leaping towards him, bare-armed, hammer swinging carelessly at his side. Tyr shook his head and chuckled as Thor approached, bellowing with the percussive force of thunder. A thick, corded arm reached out to roughly clasp Tyr by the shoulder, giving him a firm shake. Thor’s cracked and weathered lips parted in the midst of an unkempt red beard to reveal his bright teeth before throwing his head back, erupting into laughter.\n\n“Odinson,” Tyr said warmly, bowing his head formally to the huge man. \n\n“Tyr, you bastard. On time as always! Ready for a feast?” He clapped both arms on Tyr’s shoulders. \n\n“How long has it been since you’ve tasted the mead of your father’s halls?”\n\n“Not long enough,” Tyr winced. His father was the giant Hymir, and there was no love lost between the jotnar and the Aesir, giants and gods, fated to a deadly clash at Ragnarok. He did not know why Thor had insisted that he take him to see his father, but he would put aside his own reluctance all the same. \n\n“Let us go on,” he said, “though you may be at home in icy gales, I find myself longing for the crackle of a warm hearth and a full table.” \n\nThey set a brisk pace, and soon enough they reached the great halls of the giant Hymir. Thick black pillars of ash and smoke billowed from the smoke holes of the longhouse, a huge structure built from sturdy planks of giant trees, stacked fifty feet high. The polished jaws of an enormous whale opened wide to form the entrance of the hall, and as the two gods approached, they could see intricate carvings etched with great care in each plank of wood. Blue sky had long ago been chased away by the pale moon in a sea of gleaming stars, and the red glow of the hearth beckoned Thor and Tyr through the mouth of the whale and into the long hall within. Beds were leaned against the walls to make room for tables. Feasting giants sat upon high benches, laughing, singing, and drinking in abundance. The clamour of the hall burst into an uncomfortable silence as the gods walked into their midst, as even the seven foot tall Thor was dwarfed by the behemoths. From the end of the hall an especially large, magnificently bearded jotun rose from a great chair carved from bone. \n\n“Ah. Our guests have arrived,” he said, “Welcome Tyr, and Thor Odinson, to the hall of Hymir.” The courteous words were said with thinly veiled distrust, and deep-set eyes leered at the Aesir over a prominent nose. Tyr simply nodded in reply, and found an empty seat beside his father to clamour onto. Thor, never one for manners, shouted, “Welcome indeed, Hymir! I hope you have butchered your finest oxen to set a table for the likes of two hungry gods!” He laughed, and strode over to the seat next to Hymir, opposite Tyr, and casually leapt up, tearing off a shank of meat in the process. He wasted no time in setting to the task of filling his belly. Hymir looked on in wonder and annoyance as he watched Thor eat two whole oxen, while he himself, a great being over ten feet in stature, consumed only one. \n\nWhen the eating and drinking had subsided, giants lay upon the floor or hunched over the table in drunken slumber, with Tyr slowly nodding off as well. Thor had just finished licking his fingers when he looked over at the scowling Hymir, clearly eager to bid this guest farewell. For the first time since he had sat down, Thor gave his host his full attention, beckoning him to come closer. In a hoarse whisper that would have woken a deaf mule, Thor said, “Tomorrow, you take me fishing Hymir.” If Hymir had already been confused, now he was dumbfounded. \n\n“Fishing?” he asked, thick eyebrows furrowed in disbelief that the son of Odin had come all this way for a fishing trip.\n\n“Aye,” said Thor, looking over at Tyr to ensure that he was still asleep, “Fishing. For serpents.”\n\n“No… You cannot-” Hymir gasped. The air around the two seemed to chill, the giant stunned as he was pierced by Thor’s raging eyes. The man seemed to grow beyond his stature, looming over him as the anger within him welled like the gathering of black clouds. The fingers of a thickly calloused hand spread as they shot towards the throat of the massive Hymir like bolts of lightning, his face twitching in spasms under the strain of the godly grip. The hand holding Hymir’s neck pulled his face into Thor’s so that the jotun’s eyes could grasp the full depth of those electric blue orbs promising death at a single stroke. Thor relaxed his hand and the giant slumped forward, gasping. After regaining some semblance of colour in his face, he looked to Thor and nodded resignedly, panting all the while. With one final glare at Hymir, Thor threw his feet upon the great table and shut his eyes.\n\nHymir had a magnificent boat made from solid ice, and as dawn crept over the horizon, Thor and Hymir launched it in secret, leaving Tyr and the other giants behind, still strewn throughout the hall in contented sleep. The boat could hold several large jotnar, so with just Hymir and Thor, it was quite spacious. Thor had his great hammer Mjolnir, and Hymir had brought with him his magical harpoon, attached to rope so strong no beast could break it through sheer force, though one needed to be careful when holding a keen blade near it. Hymir began to grumpily row his boat at great speed to the north, through waters he knew well, for he was a fisherman and whaler of great renown. All the while, Thor watched Hymir row with suspicion. He knew not where their destination lay, and he feared some form of trickery from the giant. \n\nA thick mist soon encased them as huge chunks of ice floated alongside the boat, its frozen prow cutting through the sea like the blade of an axe. Hymir’s rhythmic rowing came to a halt, and the boat slowed to a drift. Panic filled his eyes, and he carefully moved over to Thor.\n\n“Odinson,” there was sincere terror in his voice, “Do not do this. You know very well the havoc that you will wreak should you succeed. Ragnarok itself may be the result of your actions. Do not be its unintended herald.” \nWithout looking away from the dark cold of the water Thor growled, “Keep going, Hymir. One of three will die here today. Hymir, Thor, or Jormungandr, and I mean it to be the latter.”\n\n“Thor –“\n\n“ENOUGH!” he yelled, and thunder cracked amidst a host of clouds that had not been there a moment before. The echo of his cry joined the peals of thunder in a fey song, and Hymir closed his mouth, hands holding the oars in a white-knuckled grip as he propelled the boat forward into doom. \n\nThor, Odinson, stepped over the benches of the boat, perching himself in a powerful stance at the upon the prow’s figurehead, feet digging into the ice of the carved dragon head. Rain began to pour as the fierce wind whipped his wild hair against his grim face. The savage gleam in his eyes betrayed his purpose. Thor, Odinson, was here to slay the Midgard Serpent. He was fated to kill the beast, though not on this day. At world’s end, he would kill Jormungandr, though the monster was prophesied to take the great god with him. Nine steps he would take before the poison of the wyrm brought him to his knees, like the felling of an ancient oak. But Thor, Odinson, lord of the untamed skies, was here to change his fate. Like the wind itself, he would not be guided by any will but his own. \n\nUnder the torrential storm that followed in the wake of the god of thunder, the translucent ship came to roiling waters of the deepest black, waves heaving to towering heights. Still Thor stood at the prow, upon the icy dragon’s head gleaming in the dark of the heavy clouds. Hymir’s huge, tireless arms released the oars and he furtively peered over the side, quivering with fear. \n\nWith Thor’s eyes locked on the water in front of him, he reached behind him, his open hand outstretched as water dripped from his glistening arm. \n\n“Harpoon, Hymir. NOW!” he bellowed.\n\nAlmost crawling toward him, the cowering Hymir passed his great harpoon into the palm of Thor’s hand. The storm seemed to rise into a crescendo, the wind, rain, and thunder pitched in a macabre concert. Thor’s roar dwarfed their volume as he hurled the great spear into the water, its sharp blade slicing into the darkness, tugging the rope with it. Endless lengths of line flew over the side after the harpoon, and there stood Thor at the prow, holding the end with both arms braced. Abruptly, the rope stopped, and a great sound rose from the water like an otherworldly shriek, along with sickly green pockets of air that burst into gas as they erupted to the surface. With one arm in front of the other, Thor began to haul the rope back into the boat. \n\nAs Thor reeled in his catch, the waves around the boat grew to monstrous heights, and Thor could feel the world itself strain under the tension of the great beast he was hauling forth. So large was Jormungandr that his body encompassed the earth, its tail meeting its gaping mouth in the very waters sitting below Hymir’s boat. Still Thor pulled the mighty rope, and as minutes passed, the shrieking grew louder, and in answer Thor let loose a blood-curdling roar. Finally, emerging from crashing squalls and tremoring earth, a black hulk filled the very air around them. For many moments, Thor could not distinguish any discernible features upon the unfathomable mass he had pulled from the deepest recesses of the sea, until his eyes set upon the savage maw of the Midgard Serpent, stretched wide to swallow its own tail. He tied the rope to the prow’s figurehead, then grasped Mjolnir and leapt, leaving behind him the desperate pleas of Hymir, “Thor, no! Stop! You’ll break the world!” \n\nWith a dull thud he landed upon the snout of the beast, where the harpoon of Hymir was lodged deep into the flesh of the wyrm. He looked into the huge, serpentine eyes of Jormungandr. The eyes of death. Feral zeal filled him, and with unmatched strength he hefted his hammer, ready to put it to purpose. Elation filled him. He would cheat death, cheat his fate. The prophecies themselves held no sway over his power, his spirit.\n\nKnife in hand, Hymir lunged forward at the taut rope, rending it in two. With a colossal lurch, the hateful eyes of Jormungandr descended at speed, knocking Thor from his perch to crash into the frozen sea. The Midgard Serpent sank back into the dark crevice of the world, amidst mammoth waves and quakes. \n\nThor, Odinson, hauled his dejected body back into the icy ship, head in hands as the rain and the wind battered him. His soaking hair hung raggedly over his face. Gone was the torrent in his eyes. Thor, Odinson, was going to die. \n",

    "passage": "Alan Bunce\n\nALAN COE BUNCE (June 28, 1900[1] – April 27, 1965) was an American radio and television actor.\n\nBunce was best remembered for playing the role of Albert Arbuckle alongside Peg Lynch on the sitcom _Ethel and Albert_ from 1944-50 on radio and from 1953-1956 on television. Bunce was also remembered as the first actor to portray physician Jerry Malone on radio's _Young Doctor Malone_ in the early 1940s.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nAlan Coe Bunce was born on June 28, 1900 in Westfield, New Jersey.[2] His year of birth had been the subject of dispute, with varying sources citing 1902,[3] 1903, and 1908.[4] However, according to the Bunce family papers which were published publicly in 2008 by Bunce's grandson Andrew Bunce, the Bunce family has found evidence and have accepted Bunce's birth date to be June 28, 1900.[5]\n\nBunce's year of birth is given as 1900 on his U.S. World War I Draft Registration Card (1917–18)[6] Bunce's age is given as 39 in the United States Census of 1940 (enumerated on April 27, 1940).[7]\n\nBunce the youngest of three children born to Theodore Dwight Bunce, an inventor, and Alice Edwards Bunce. His mother died when Bunce was a young boy. He graduated from a high school in Melrose, Massachusetts in 1918.\n\n\nCareer\n\nBunce's career began in the early 1930s with small roles in several films and guest appearances on several radio programs. Bunce did not get household recognition until 1939 when he began playing the role of Dr. Jerry Malone, the young physician who dispensed prescriptions and advice to the folks of Three Oaks on the medical drama _Young Doctor Malone_. He left the program in 1944.\n\nThe same year Bunce left _Young Doctor Malone_, he replaced film star Richard Widmark in the role of working-class man Albert Arbuckle, the male lead on Peg Lynch's _Ethel and Albert_.[8] Lynch played the female lead and Albert's wife Ethel Arbuckle. Bunce remained with the radio show for its entire six year run.\n\nBunce played New York State Governor Al Smith in “Sunrise at Campobello” about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's early battle with polio and return to public life during the 1924 Democratic convention where Roosevelt walked ten steps to the podium and stood for 45 minutes to nominate the Governor for president.[9]\n\nBunce broke into television in 1950 with a guest star appearance of the ABC anthology series _The Clock_. Bunce's “Albert Arbuckle” character also moved to television starting with appearances on _The Kate Smith Hour_ beginning in 1952. This led to the premiere of the televised version of _Ethel and Albert_ on NBC April 25, 1953. The show stayed on NBC until Christmas Day, 1954.

    "passage": "Bethlehem Academy (Faribault, Minnesota)\n\nBETHLEHEM ACADEMY, also known as B.A., is a private, Roman Catholic high school for grades six through twelve located in Faribault, Minnesota. It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and is sponsored by the Sinsinawa Dominican Congregation of the Most Holy Rosary.[1] Bethlehem Academy is commonly recognized for its volleyball team which has made eleven state tournament appearances since 2002 and won the Class A State Championship title seven times.\n\n\nAcademics\n\nBethlehem Academy's class offerings include those within the following subjects: English, science, math, social studies, theology, fine arts and industrial technology, physical education/health, and world language. B.A. operates on a semester basis with an unweighted and unranked grade point system. Because of Bethlehem Academy's Catholic tradition, the academic curriculum mandates theology classes at every grade level. The class schedule is altered for the all-school weekly Mass days. Its “block” class schedule implements core classes that are held each day with electives held on a rotational basis. The school is not required by law to complete state testing but rather implements its own form of standardized testing: the ACT series. Made up of three tests, each completed at different grade levels, the series of testing aims to prepare students for the national college entrance ACT exam and serve as a guide to uncover areas of institutional academic need.[2]\n\nGrading System\n\n-   A (4.000)\n\n94-100\n\n-   A- (3.667)\n\n90-93\n\n-   B+ (3.333)\n\n87-89\n\n-   B (3.000)\n\n83-86\n\n-   B- (2.667)\n\n80-82\n\n-   C+ (2.333)\n\n77-79\n\n-   C (2.000)\n\n73-76\n\n-   C- (1.667)\n\n70-72\n\n-   D+ (1.333)\n\n67-69\n\n-   D (1.000)\n\n63-66\n\n-   D- (0.667)\n\n60-62\n\n-   F (0.000)\n\n59 & below[3]\n\n\nAthletics\n\nLike the volleyball team, the golf, girls basketball, and football team have also made state tournament appearances. In 2008, the Bethlehem Academy golf team took third place in the Class A State Championships. Those team members included Adam Donahue, Dayne Paro, Jason Knoff, Eric Hagen, Grant Wayland, and Nick Murray. Grant Wayland, who also played in the 2007 golf state championships, earned the Class A State Individual Champion title in 2008.[4]\n\nThe girls basketball team made brief appearances at the state tournament in both 1998 and 2013.[5]\n\nLastly, the varsity football team was back-to-back Section 1A champs in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, they were the Minnesota Class A State Runner up, losing 14-20 to Mahnomen High School in Prep Bowl XXXI. In 2013 they lost to the Mahnomen Indians 19-0 in the State Semifinals. In 2015 the Cardinals won Section 2A and were then defeated by the Goodhue Wildcats in the state quarterfinals. In 2017 the Cardinals won section 2A and were then defeated by the Wabasso Rabbits in the state quarterfinals.[6][7]\n\nFOOTBALL\n\n-   Section Titles: 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017\n-   State Semifinalist: 2013\n-   State Runner-Up: 2012\n\nVolleyball\n\nThe varsity girls volleyball team has made eleven appearances at the Minnesota State High School Volleyball Championship Tournament at the Xcel Energy Center since 2002. The B.A. Cardinals volleyball team was Class A state runner-up in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008. They have won the Class A State Championship title in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2014.[8] Several girls have been named to the All-State team since they have been playing at the state tournament and one, Betty Slinger, was even named Minnesota Ms. Volleyball and Gatorade Player of the Year in 2003.[9] The team has also been awarded for its outstanding academic achievements and player GPA averages. Most recently, in 2014, the Cardinals were awarded the Gold level of the MSHSL Academic Team award with an average GPA of 3.82.[10] The head coach of the team, Franz Boelter, has received many accolades for his coaching achievements. In 2008, Franz was nominated to the Minnesota Volleyball Coaches Association (MNVBCA) Hall of Fame, has received several Minnesota Coach of the Year awards, and has earned a spot on the Win Club 500.[11][12][13]\n\nSchool Song\n\nWe're loyal to you, oh B.A.\n\nWe're faithful and true, oh B.A.\n\nWe'll back you to stand, you're the best in the land, for we think you are grand, oh B.A. - RAH!

Access privileges can also be revoked or modified for any student as a probationary condition or disciplinary consequence. The school also offers multimedia and film classes which utilizes the computer software programs and develop the student's computer skills.[15]\n\nMiddle School “School Within a School”\n\nWith its own “middle school team” of teachers who focus on middle school grade level curriculum, Bethlehem Academy's middle school aims to expose students in grades 6-8 to the core academic areas. The middle school core classes are: theology, English, social studies, science and math. All students in the middle school program additionally take music and physical education classes. Upon entering high school, every middle school student will have participated in interdisciplinary projects developed by the “middle school team” faculty members. These projects are designed to apply multiple different areas of academia to the project solution.[16]\n\nCollege in the Schools (CIS)\n\nIn partnership with the University of Minnesota, B.A. students in the 11th and 12th grade have the opportunity to earn college credits by taking college courses taught at Bethlehem Academy by accredited B.A. faculty members; however, students wanting to take these courses must meet certain GPA requirements and pay a course fee, comparably lower to that of the college's tuition rate. Courses offered include a semester long U.S. History course equalling 3 college credits, and yearlong 4 credit courses Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology and Calculus.[17]\n\nStudent Activities\n\nStudents can participate in a number of extra-curricular activities, clubs, and associations. In addition to the number of sports B.A. students can choose to participate in, students can choose to contribute to the Bethlehem Academy “Star” newspaper as well as the “Veritas” yearbook by joining each's corresponding editing clubs. They may also participate in the theatre program. Every year, the Bethlehem Academy student body holds elections to vote students onto the two branches of B.A.’s student council. Additionally, Bethlehem Academy offers chapters of Students Against Destructive Decisions (S.A.D.D.), Key Club, and National Honor Society.

It covered competitive video gaming by providing coverage for organisers including the Electronic Sports League and United Kingdom eSports Association.\n\n\nHistory\n\nXLEAGUE.TV was launched on Sky channel 291, on 16 May 2007.[1]\n\nThe channel partnered with EVS Broadcast Equipment, to use its live outside broadcast digital video production systems on television productions.[2]\n\nFresh new programming was announced to air alongside its existing line-up of shows. This was the result of community feedback from its viewers.[3]\n\nOn 12 October 2007, the channel announced that it was partnering with fellow UK tournament organisers, Enemy Down to run a series of team games for titles including Counter-Strike: Source in the Packard Bell European Open, which the hardware manufacturer will be supporting with prizes.[4]\n\nOn 8 November 2007, XLEAGUE.TV announced a brand alliance with the Alex Zane Breakfast Show on UK radio station, XFM.[5]\n\nIt was revealed on 22 January 2008 that the channel had entered into an agreement with US men's entertainment channel MavTV, who had provided the niche sports content.[6]\n\nThe channel rebranded as Pulse on 13 February 2008, which was made up of separately branded XLEAGUE.TV and MavTV blocks. The EPG channel number moved to Sky channel 208.[7] The channel still retained all the XLEAGUE programmes and website, prior to the rebrand.\n\nXLEAGUE.TV, alongside the Metropolitan Police Service, TNWA Group, Packard Bell, London Borough of Southwark, Microsoft and Electronic Arts launched Project Gamerz on 28 February 2008, an initiative to bring eSports to the local community.[8]\n\nIn February 2008, the channel held its biggest prize funded event yet and was the biggest Halo 3 tournament Europe had seen. From September 2007, the teams had been playing to fight to the top of the leaderboard, and in February 2008, the finals were held in the studios and broadcast on the channel. The Incredibles (now Team Dignitas – http://www.team-dignitas.net/) came 1st and won 5k between them. Team Devastation (http://www.devastationuk.com) came second and won 2.5k to share. This was the last tournament XLEAGUE held.\n\nPulse continued with its “brand block” by introducing Martial Arts TV onto the channel on 8 July 2008.[9]\n\nPortland TV denied that XLEAGUE.TV has been axed.[10] The channel was in a consultation period and reassessing its content and format.\n\nOn 6 February 2009, it was announced that it had been bought out by TNWA Group and that it will become a productions unit to create shows for other outlets.[11] Its online operations has been merged with Enemy Down.[12]\n\n\nThe channel\n\nWhen XLEAGUE.TV was previously owned by Portland TV, it was an eSports channel concentrating on the competitive side of video gaming. In this respect, it differed from other examples of video game programming in the country, such as Cybernet, which had a broader remit, to cover video games in general. The channel was closely paired to its own self-titled website.[13] The online resource encouraged community discussion, while also serving as a platform to organise tournaments and invitational events, some of which may later be screened, on the channel, via its flagship programme, _The Match_.\n\nThe website provided interviews with standout competitors, be they clans or individuals. General news updates were provided from the world of gaming, along with the ability to sign up to participate in league or tournaments, in the search of recognition, fun and prizes. Some games offer sponsored free-play, whilst others required a subscription for entrance.[14]\n\nUsers could upload videos they have created on the website as well. The site also offered a community podcast in the form of Talkback, in which the XLEAGUE.TV community and channel staff offered their views on raised concerns, and filled the audience in as to upcoming highlights.\n\nThe channel went through a rebrand, where XLEAGUE.TV became a “brand block”, alongside MavTV, Cultra and Martial Arts TV on Pulse, an entertainment channel previously on the British Sky Broadcasting satellite network in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nRecent programmes and projects\n\nSince its departure as a television channel, the production unit has produced or has been involved in the following:\n\n-   UKESA SEASON 1 GRAND FINALS –\n\n    XLEAGUE.TV and QuadV worked together to broadcast the United Kingdom eSports Association Season One finals over IPTV via QuadV.com and Enemydown.eu.\n\n\nPast programmes\n\nA wealth of shows were produced during the air of its television channel on the British Sky Broadcasting platform:\n\n-   CASUAL GAMING SHOW – _Runtime: 60 mins / Episodes: 1_\n\n    Aimed at a younger audience, the show was family orientated, and offered a competitive but fun way of playing against one another.

    "passage": "Somewhere underneath an unremarkable section of industrial railroad tracks, is a stone tunnel with an enduring mystery. Who built it, when and why all seem to be accomplishments that was never passed down to the modern world, and yet, this intriguing piece of Vermont curio oddly exists untouched in the stretches of the state’s largest metropolitan area – its presence not noticed by the majority unless you’re one of the select few that know about it.\n\nIf you manage to find it, you can hear the hum of traffic nearby, the various noises that scream from a nearby generating plant and the voices of passing on-goers that carry out though the woods. And yet, here the tunnel sits in an enclaved world protected by treacherous railroad banks covered in thorns and foliage and the remnants of several homeless camps scattered around basins of coal black ooze – an ominous warning for those who decide to leave their world and enter this one.\n\nAnd once you approach the tunnel entrance, a foul blackness that cannot be penetrated descends deep into the bowels of the hillside.\n\nStories abound about this strange tunnel. Speaking to a friend of mine, he was able to recall plenty of bizarre urban legends and strange lore about it. There was said to be a forbidding barred gate which lies somewhere inside, and macabre tales of dead bodies being discovered deep in the far recesses. I knew I had to see such a place!\n\nWe conversed further, as I became eager to get to the bottom of this. The most interesting detail about this tunnel is what makes it so enigmatic. No one seems to be quite sure about why it exists, or when it was constructed.\n\nBut there are plenty of theories as to why it was built. Some speculate that it was once a cow tunnel, a way of transporting livestock from one pasture to another which were divided by the railroads. And if you take modern day agro-industrial farming methods into account, the cows of yesteryear were smaller – making the tunnel’s size a realistic possibility. But if this was the case, then why does it dead end into a dripping stone wall some 60 feet from the entrance? Other theories are that when development came to the area, the property owners across the tracks discovered the entrance and sealed it up. But there is no proof of this, so we’re back to speculating. Was the tunnel built one way, or did it have another entrance?\n\nSome speculate that the tunnel was built to house railroad supplies, such as dynamite and rail ties during construction in the mid 1800s – however, this too is only a theory. For a simplistic project, this seemed like a strangely labor intensive storage shed.  Too add further confusion, we still aren’t really sure if the tunnel predates the railroad or not, which leads me to the most intriguing possibility.\n\nThere are some that romanticize about the tunnel being so archaic that it predates Columbian settlement here in the United States. The stones are old, hand hewn and placed to form the walls and ceiling in baffling rhythmic precision in their uneven size and form- so it is a possibility. After all, it is now an accepted theory that Celtic copper miners once came to Vermont before the Europeans did some 3000 years ago, to harvest our vast copper resources when Europe was in the midst of a copper shortage. Upon doing so, they left their legacy here by building several mysterious stone structures and tunnels that lay scattered across the state, some even showcasing ancient inscriptions evocative of that time period. Today, these strange mounds are a topic of hot debate amongst archaeologists. However, Vermont’s ancient stone structures were all constructed differently than the tunnel in question, and it doesn’t quite fit the picture here. Mortar was also used in the construction, meaning that the tunnel is relatively newer than what the first throngs of European explorers would have ran into.\n\nWith no specialist making a visit to the tunnel to officially verify the age of its construction, this theory can only be that. And we’re right back to where we started. But one thing is for certain, if you can find it, you can see it for yourself. And that’s what I planned on doing.\n\nVisiting The Tunnel\n\nIt was a warm September day when myself and a friend went searching for this elusive tunnel. But the question was, how would we find it? The foliage around the tracks was so thick and unforgiving, that it would be impossible to distinguish a simple stone tunnel underneath so much that competed for our attention.\n\nEventually after we had been walking the tracks for a good while, we decided to just jump off into the woods, literally, and see if we could get a better view of the steep banks that slumped below the railroad bed. If there was a tunnel here, we’d have to be on ground level to see it. But this literal jump proved to be an adventure we didn’t take into account. Weeds, thick trees with hanging vines and a “ground” made from soggy marshlands and layers of rotting trees was the landscape we were now fighting against, and walking around in it was treacherous and tiresome.\n\nPeople Of The Sticks\n\nThroughout this desolate and unforgiving landscape, we began to notice a web of sinuous trails that were well worn, and disappeared behind the thick veil of foliage. Making a conscious risky decision, we picked one and followed it. Little did we expect to find what looked like imaginative landscaping attempts. In the middle of nowhere.\n\n[DSC_0738_pe]\n\n[My friend thought the eyes were 2 miniature security cameras. Though we were far away from civilization at this point, we both involuntarily tensed up at the thought.]\n\nMy friend thought the eyes were 2 miniature security cameras. Though we were far away from civilization at this point, we both involuntarily tensed up at the thought.\n\n[Following the path brought us right to the front door of the exact thing I expected and yet didn’t want to see – a homeless camp. Tents, sleeping bags and shopping carts were stashed underneath thick foliage that clinged to my jacket.]\n\nFollowing the path brought us right to the front door of the exact thing I expected and yet didn’t want to see – a homeless camp. Tents, sleeping bags and shopping carts were stashed underneath thick foliage that clinged to my jacket.\n\n[Further down the path, we stumbled into more development. This however seemed to be a clandestine farming operation, the farmers were nowhere to be seen thankfully.]\n\nFurther down the path, we stumbled into more development. This however seemed to be a clandestine farming operation, the farmers were nowhere to be seen thankfully.\n\nFinally, after an extensive amount of time searching, we had found the fabled tunnel.\n\n[DSC_0755_pe]\n\nThere looked like there once was a wooden door that covered the entrance, but had long been ripped off.\n\nWith the overwhelming evidence of homeless camps littering the immediate area, we approached cautiously. Who knew if anyone was sleeping (or perhaps, waiting) inside the dark depths of the tunnel, waiting to strike. Taking out a flashlight, we shined the LED light straight down the center of the shaft, illuminating the gloomy interior, and called out “hello?” a few times. The tunnel was empty, and in we went.\n\nInside the tunnel, we had to crouch down and ignore the uncomfortable feeling of dripping water coming from the stone roof. Immediately, we were met with the discarded remains of a homeless camp. Boots, a mattress, what appeared to be a few old wooden crates and a few knives that sat in pools of a foul orange slime that seemed to coat the entire tunnel floor. We noticed 2 odd features of the tunnel, one being 2 man made slits in the stone walls that stretched back to about my elbows – just wide enough to store small objects in. In the second, farthest section of the tunnel, the ceiling was supported by what looked like stolen railroad ties, their red rust stood out brilliantly in the flashlight beams.\n\nTraversing this tunnel was no easy feat. The floor was slick and slippery. Not long after entering, our boots were covered with thick orange slime that offered us no traction. The further we ventured back, the more rotted the wood and debris became, almost disintegrating underneath our feat as the tunnel clearance became smaller and smaller. As we stood inside, trying to figure the great mystery about the place, it was impossible. The shadows of the past span so fast that everything the tunnel gave to me was blurred.\n\n[DSC_0761_pe] [DSC_0763_pe]\n\n[DSC_0765_pe] [DSC_0768_pe] [DSC_0772_pe] [DSC_0773_pe]\n\n[Railroad ties that spanned the ceiling were used in some of the tunnel’s construction]\n\nRailroad ties that spanned the ceiling were used in some of the tunnel’s construction\n\n[interesting markings on the tunnel ceiling]\n\ninteresting markings on the tunnel ceiling\n\nAs I was inside, I recalled my friend telling me further about his adventure in this tunnel Years ago. On his expedition inside, he came across a peculiar find. He had ventured inside, and not long after, he noticed his flashlight beam illuminate a thick grey blanket that was hanging across the interior, which was most likely deliberately placed, creating the illusion that the tunnel was actually much shorter than it actually was. Carefully talking down the faux wall, it opened up another several feet of tunnel that rambled off into the dark, before finally ending again at a real stone wall. He guessed that a homeless person who wanted to keep curious visitors away from his home in the end of the tunnel, created the wall for a bit of anonymity and security.\n\n[]\n\nThis picture taken by Joe Citro shows the gray blanket draped across the interior he encountered.\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\nI was warned of the possibility of finding knives or other sinister artifacts inside. It seems Joe Citro found just that. (photo: Joe Citro)\n\nThe reality of the mysterious order of people who frequent and possibly live the dank tunnel was a sobering reality, and only added to the deepening mystery. Another friend told me stories of him finding actual knives next to a makeshift bed – and told me to be cautious while exploring. So until some information takes form, or a developer decides to seal it up – the tunnel will continue to baffle curious visitors and harbor the fallen.\n\nDISCLAIMER: You’ll notice I didn’t give away the location of the tunnel. That was intentional, in order to protect special and endangered locations like this one. So please, don’t ask.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nTo all of my amazing fans and supporters, I am truly grateful and humbled by all of the support and donations through out the years that have kept Obscure Vermont up and running.\n\nAs you all know I spend countless hours researching, writing, and traveling to produce and sustain this blog.

    "passage": "Watched (Warning: Long &amp; Only First Of Many Parts)\n\nI wrote this a while back for a school assignment, but I figured if anyone was interested in reading it and telling me how they feel then I will submit it here. It's not the best writing, but I did this when I was 15. If anyone wants me to put more up if they like it then feel free to ask.\nIt's set in the  future and is full of augmentations and all that cool stuff. Deus Ex was a big inspiration  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPrologue\n\n\n\n\n\n15th February 2072\nJackson Hudson was annoyed. The blueprints for Project Tyrano were late. Very late. If someone didn’t turn up soon with them, he would fire Martell. Or worse. Hudson was a tall man. He had such long hair, that he often would have people approach him, telling him to have a haircut. He was also very tanned and strong as a result of his daily swimming and runs along the beach. He did not look like someone who was a multi-millionaire. \nMartell barged into his office knocking over some pot plants, not bothering to put any of them back up. Martell was almost the opposite of Hudson. Fat and a slob, who could never be bothered walking past his front door. But he was extremely smart, Hudson reminded himself. That was one of the only reasons Martell even existed. He had everything related to Project Tyrano on his shoulders. \n“I’m so sorry this is late sir,” said Martell. In his hand was a single sheet which had every detail about Project Tyrano on.\n “I had my team working on it for twelve hours straight last night.” Hudson got up from his office chair without a word and took the blueprint from Martell. Very good, he thought. Everything is here and proper. Hudson looked up to Martell, although still angry with him, was more relaxed. \n“Do you have a prototype for me?” asked Hudson. Martell started to sweat, realizing that step two of the project was also required today. He either had to lie or face the consequences for his actions. But in this case, those consequences could be death. \n“Well…uhh….” Martell stammered.  Hudson, sensed something was wrong, asked again.\n “Where is the prototype?”\nThis time it was louder and blunter. He knew that Martell didn’t have it. \n“You don’t have it, do you?”\nMartell, struggling to answer, shook his head. Hudson stood there for a second thinking about what options he had. He could kill him, and this could serve as a warning to all the other employees that failure to meet the organization’s expectations resulted in death. But he would be losing a great resource in him. Martell was so valuable, so important, and he was vital for Project Tyrano’s success. \nHudson pulled out a 784 pistol, and put it to Martell’s head. The 784 had bullets that were so powerful, that if the bullet did not pierce or reach the victim, it could be optimized with an explosion at different distances. That explosion would also have gas that would kill anyone near it instantly. It was the latest technology. But he didn’t need that gas today. That was for difficult kills. Hudson walked right up to Martell and whispered very clearly into his ear. “If this ever happens again, this bullet goes through your brain. Do you understand me?”\nMartell was so frightened for his life that he only just made out a very quiet but audible “Yes.”\nHudson punched him in the jaw. “Get the hell out of my sight, and if you don’t have that prototype by Monday then you are dead.” He spat out the last word as Martell ran from the room.   \n\nChapter One\n\n\n\n\nKayo had just finished school. A storm was on its way so he didn't want to linger around school any more than he had to. Aaron had caught a bus to the nearest skate park, ignoring the warnings. Kayo pulled his hoody down. He knew how cautious people were these days, a menacing teenager in a hoody often made others very judging. Kayo was fifteen. He was a pretty sporty kid, and pretty smart although his appearance made it seem less so. He had long brown hair that was in a style of a kind of surf dude. He was used to be out playing sports all the time ... although lately he had not. It began to rain. Kayo cursed his bad luck and ran to the closest bus stop. He took out his phone, thin, four inch screen with the fastest internet speeds possible. One of the most popular and luxurious phones available. It had taken him many shifts at work to pay for this phone. He selected some of the latest songs to stream and popped two very small wireless buds into his ears. He sat back and waited for the bus. \n\nThe bus arrived ten minutes later. Kayo popped his bus card into the slot on the inside of the bus. It withdrew some cash and on his phone popped up a message asking him where he would like to go. He selected his home in the favorites section. \n\"Ridge-view Drive is this correct?\" it replied.\nYes, he selected. He sat down next to a teenage girl who looked about the same age as him. There were no bus drivers anymore. Ever since the latest AI technology assistants had been introduced, the same technology had been implemented into nearly every transport imaginable. Public transport was much more common as only the most expensive cars came with AI. Many people were still driving manual, non-AI cars. The government had been trying to get rid of these and the roads and just have public transport and keep the AI cars for the rich and important. So far their attempts at convincing the public had been unsuccessful. He eyed up the girl, she was nice looking and he had never seen her around his school before. Kayo wanted to strike up a chat, but he wasn't quite sure how he could bring up a conversation. \n\n***\n\nThe bus stopped halfway down the street he lived, and as he stood up, the girl got off to at the same stop. She turned around and started walking the opposite direction. Kayo still wanted to get to know her, but he had no idea what to do. He brought out a dollar and chucked it at the ground. Swiftly he picked it up and asked the girl.\n\"Is this yours?\" \nNow she was looking at him, he could get a better look at her. She had blue eyes and blonde hair, such a girl that you would dream about. She was slightly smaller than him, but that was quite tall because Kayo was usually much taller than most kids his age. \n\"No...I don't think I had any change on me,\" she said. But she was interested in him, he saw. \n\"Where do you live?\" He asked. \"I've never seen you around here before,\" \nShe blushed. Too soon, perhaps? \n\"I’ve only just moved here with my parents,\" she said. She was calm and interested in conversation too, that's good, he thought. \"My mum just got a job with some company...\" \nShe hesitated, probably because she had told a lot of information to a person she barely knew. \n\"Sorry, my name’s Kayo, I just live down the road from here,\" Kayo said quickly. \n\"Danielle,\" the newly named Danielle said. Kayo needed to get home before it got too dark...but why pass up on a new relationship?\n\"Hmm, maybe we should catch up sometime?\" he stumbled. She blushed. \n“Ah, I actually have a boyfriend...\" He turned red. He felt really stupid now. \n\"Ah, ok, ah, that's fine, ah, bye, I guess\" He turned to leave, feeling stupid, for not realizing that a girl like her would be taken.\n\"Wait!\" she called. He turned. \n\"Give me your phone,\" she said. \n\"Why?\"\n\"I want to give you my number stupid,\" \nA quick change in attitude, she stopped and smiled at him to let him know she was kidding around. He gave her his phone. Kayo was confused.\n \"You have a boyfriend...?\" \n\"Yes, but he might not be for long...\" Danielle gave back his phone. She leaned in to his ear. \n\"Call me\" she whispered. She left and went down the street and Kayo was left wondering what kind of girl she might be.\n\n***\n\nIt was just after six before Kayo finally got home. He lived with his Dad. Fifteen years ago, just after Kayo was born, his Mum disappeared without a trace. The governments have chips in everyone’s skin. Like animals, some would say. Kayo's Dad reported her missing when driving home from work. The police went onto the database to try to find her. Technology had come so far, that anyone who was on earth could be tracked through the tiniest chip in them. They couldn't find her. She had literally disappeared. Either someone had abducted her and removed the chip or... no one knew.  Fifteen years and not a trace.\nSo Kayo lived with his Dad. His house was not very big. Single story, with a bland coloured roof and only two bedrooms. Just big enough for the two of them. Kayo’s hand went into his pocket, finding his phone he scanned his phone on the door. Access granted. The old wooden door unlocked and he walked in. His Dad wasn't home yet. Probably still at work. He threw his school bag near the kitchen. Kayo didn't know how to cook. It was only lucky Dad knew a bit about it, he thought. Picking up his phone, he quickly tapped towards the nicest sounding pizza delivery service and ordered using his online account. He started on his math until the pizza came. Came through the \"mailbox\". The mailbox was like a hub, of some sort inside people's homes. It collects packages, that people sent, food, anything really. All travelled by underground tunnels propelled by some unnatural force. \nIt was nine o’clock when his Dad got home. \n\"Hey mate,\" he heard down the hallway. Dad came down the hallway. Steve Collins. Kayo's second name was Collins naturally. He was pretty scruffy. The years hadn't served him well. He was in his forties and had a great stubby beard which kept on growing, no matter how much he shaved it. So he just let it grow. \n\"Did you grab anything?\" he asked expectantly.  Kayo nodded.\n\"I grabbed a pizza, but the rest of its probably cold by now.\"\nSteve gave him a slap on the back. \"Doesn't matter, it'll be all right, I'll just heat it up,\"\n\n*To be continued...*\n\n",

    "passage": "Panzer Dragoon\n\nis a series of video games by Sega. The first three games were developed in the 1990s by Sega's Team Andromeda for the Sega Saturn console. The fourth, _Panzer Dragoon Orta_ (2002), was developed for Xbox by Sega's Smilebit team.\n\nThe _Panzer Dragoon_ games are rail shooters, except _Panzer Dragoon Saga_ (1998), a role-playing game. All games follow the story of a hero or heroine fighting an evil empire in a post-apocalyptic world while riding a dragon. The series' name originates from its original concept designers referring to it as “armoured dragon”, then feeling that this was too bland and deciding to transliterate it to German.[1] The cutscenes feature its own language, Panzerese, which is a mixed language based on a combination of Ancient Greek, English, German, Japanese, Latin, and Russian. The words in these languages were a hobby of Yukio Futatsugi, one of the core designers of the first game.\n\nSega announced in December 2018 that remakes of _Panzer Dragoon_ and _Panzer Dragoon II Zwei_ were in development. The first remake was released in 2020 for Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, Steam, PlayStation 4, Amazon Luna and Xbox One.\n\n\nPremise\n\nThe _Panzer Dragoon_ series takes place on a post-apocalyptic planet where the people compete for land, resources, and the technology of the Ancients. The ‘Ancients’ is the generic name given to the people that once controlled a world-spanning, hyper-advanced civilization thousands of years before the start of the Panzer Dragoon series of games. The Ancients were able to create monsters either for war use or practical uses.\n\nThese creatures survived the downfall of the Ancients and are one of the main enemies in the series. A mysterious cataclysm, hinted at as a terrible war during the course of the series, would spell the downfall of this civilization and nearly destroy the world, leaving the survivors to eke out a bleak existence among the blasted remains in the ensuing millennia. Eventually, the Ancients and their works would gain a sort of 'godlike' respect, and a horrific regard, among some people as they passed into legend.\n\nThe remnants of these technologies are used in the development of much of humanity's own machinery, weaponry and vehicles, such as the unusual floating ships which are a staple of the series. A faction called _The Empire_ have collected and used weapons from the Ancient Age to gain dominance of the continent.\n\n\nGames\n\n_Panzer Dragoon_ (1995)\n\nThe first _Panzer Dragoon_ was released on the Sega Saturn in 1995. It follows the story of Keil Fluge, a member of a hunter party who encounters a fight between two dragons, coloured black and blue. The rider of the blue dragon is mortally wounded in the battle and entrusts his mission, as well as his dragon, the Solo Wing, to Keil. Keil must stop the Dark Dragon reactivating an ancient ruin.\n\nThis chapter introduced the basic features of the traditional gameplay that the Panzer series would be known by, starting out as a rail shooter giving the player a choice of two main attacks: a lock-on laser weapon, and a rapid fire gun weapon, as well as the ability to swing the cameras around to shoot the enemies coming from all directions.\n\nPanzer Dragoon was one of the few games available at the Sega Saturn's North American launch. The game was ported to Microsoft Windows only in Japan on March 14, 1997,[2] and in 2006 adapted slightly for Sega's Japanese PlayStation 2 “AGES 2500” series. The game is getting a high definition remake for the Nintendo Switch, slated for release in winter 2020.[3]\n\n_Panzer Dragoon R-zone_ (1995)\n\n_Panzer Dragoon R-Zone_ is a Tiger R-Zone game for the short-lived system. It was one of the few launch titles licensed by Sega, being released just a few months after the original _Panzer Dragoon_.[4] It was the first game in the series that was not developed by Team Andromeda. There is no plot, simply a nameless character on an armored dragon attempting to keep a dark dragon from reaching a tower while shooting and dodging robots.\n\n_Panzer Dragoon II Zwei_ (1996)\n\n_Panzer Dragoon II Zwei_ (also known as _Panzer Dragoon II_) was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. This game is a prequel to _Panzer Dragoon_. It follows the story of Jean-Luc Lundi who discovered a mutant coolia, whom he names Lagi, who has a green glow at its throat, and is growing wings. Lundi refuses to kill Lagi, defying his villages custom that mutant coolias be killed. Together, Lundi and Lagi ride towards the horizon, chasing after a great airship called the Shelcoof, which is responsible for destroying Lundi's village while he was away.\n\nThis game introduced the berserk ability, where the player builds up a bar and then can unleash a powerful attack. It also introduced multiple routes through levels, and the dragon's capacity to change shape when the player performed well in a level.\n\nA high definition remake for Nintendo Switch was announced in October 2019.[5]\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Mini_ (1996)\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Mini_ is a Sega Game Gear game released only in Japan, in 1996.[6] Due to the technical limitations of the Game Gear, the camera cannot be controlled and instead rotates automatically; also, for the first and — so far — only time in the series' history, the dragon doesn't have a rider. The game is markedly different from others in the series due to lack of a story and the dragon's super deformed appearance. Most of the levels and enemies are modeled after those of _Panzer Dragoon Zwei_.\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Saga_ (1998)\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Saga_ (titled _Azel: Panzer Dragoon RPG_ in Japan) is a role-playing video game released for Saturn in 1998.[7] It is the only _Panzer Dragoon_ game that is not a rail shooter, combining traditional role-playing elements such as random encounters with the 3D shooting elements of previous games. The player controls Edge, a young mercenary who battles the empire on a flying dragon and encounters a mysterious girl from a vanished civilization.[8] Unlike the other _Panzer Dragoon_ games, movement is not on rails and some areas are explored on foot. The battle system mixes real-time and turn-based elements,[9] with the player circling enemies on the dragon to expose weak spots and escape dangerous positions.[10]\n\nDevelopment of _Panzer Dragoon Saga_ began around the same time as _Panzer Dragoon II Zwei_. According to director Yukio Futatsugi, the need to blend the series' shooting elements into an RPG with full 3D and voice acting - both unusual for RPGs at the time - made it the most difficult _Panzer Dragoon_ game to develop. Two staff members died during its two-year development, which Futatsugi attributed to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry.[11]\n\nAccording to GameRankings, _Panzer Dragoon Saga_ is the most critically acclaimed Saturn game, winning praise for its story, graphics, music, and unusual battle system.[12] It has appeared in several “greatest games of all time” lists.[13][14][15] As Sega had shifted its focus to its next console, the Dreamcast, the game had a limited release outside Japan, attracting a cult following. It has not been rereleased and is now a rare collector's item. After its release, Sega disbanded Team Andromeda; Futatsugi left Sega and joined Konami,[16] while other staff moved to Sega teams including Smilebit.[17]\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Orta_ (2002)\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Orta_ is an Xbox game released in late 2002 in Japan and in early 2003 in America and Europe. It was developed by Smilebit which had been founded by former members of Team Andromeda.\n\n_Panzer Dragoon Orta_ follows the story of Orta, a teenage girl being held captive in a town. When the town is attacked by the Empire, Orta is rescued by a Dragon, and encounters a drone named Abadd. While tracking the drone, she discovers the truth behind her own origins, and helps to free the world from the tyranny of the Empire. This game introduced several updated features, such as the ability to morph the dragon at will, and maneuvering abilities from _Panzer Dragoon Saga_.\n\nThis game had large amounts of unlockable content to be gained after completing the main story. These include a group of sub-missions, one series of which is devoted to the backstory of Iva Demilcol. The “Box Game” is a bonus mode first introduced in _Zwei_ where the player can select different dragons, riders, and various cheats. The PC version of the first _Panzer Dragoon_ is included in its entirety.\n\nThe game also possesses a vast in-game dictionary that updates as you progress, detailing the _Panzer_ world, and full-motion video from the game itself is unlocked for casual viewing, as well as the intro and ending videos from _Panzer Dragoon_, _Panzer Dragoon Zwei_ and _Panzer Dragoon Saga_.\n\nRemakes (2020)\n\nIn December 2018, Sega announced that remakes of _Panzer Dragoon_ and _Panzer Dragoon II Zwei_ were in development by MegaPixel Studio.[18] The first remake was released for Nintendo Switch[19] and Stadia in 2020.[20] PlayStation 4 and Steam versions were released later in 2020.[21]\n\n\nOther media\n\nSoundtrack CDs were released in Japan for all the games, with _Panzer Dragoon Orta_'s being bundled with the game itself. Toykopop released the _Panzer Dragoon Orta_ soundtrack in the USA. An anime adaptation of the first game was released, with the story being slightly altered to include a female heroine whom Keil ('Kyle' in the anime) is trying to save when she becomes bonded to the Black Dragon. The English version was released by ADV Films. An artbook from the second game, _Die Welt Von Panzer Dragoon Zwei_ (_The World of Panzer Dragoon Zwei_) was also released.\n\n_Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed_ features a racetrack based on _Panzer Dragoon_. Additionally, the _Worlds Unite_ crossover between the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ and the _Mega Man_ comic lines from Archie Comics features _Panzer Dragoon_ characters and concepts.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] Panzer Dragoon PC version release data, IGN.\n\n[3] \n\n[4] Panzer Dragoon R-Zone release data, IGN.

With construction crews still putting the finishing touches on brand new Raymond James Stadium, the Buccaneers were forced to play all of their preseason games on the road. The team opened with a win against Pittsburgh in the Hall of Fame Game, then faced Kansas City in Oklahoma, an ordeal which saw the team sit at the airport nearly all night.\n\nAfter another road trip to Miami, the travel started taking a toll on the team. A cross-country trip to Oakland was followed four days later by a game at New Orleans.\n\nWeek 1: at Minnesota Vikings\n\nComing off their playoff season from 1997, the Buccaneers opened 1998 with high expectations. Still on the road, their first game in the new stadium would have to wait until week 3. Receiver Bert Emanuel went out with a sprained ankle, and Tampa Bay lost 31–7.\n\nWeek 2: at Green Bay Packers\n\nJacques Green returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown (only his second-career return attempt) to set a franchise record for longest punt return. However, Green Bay won 23–15.\n\nWeek 3: Chicago Bears\n\nAfter five games on the road during the preseason, and the first two regular season games played away, the Buccaneers finally were ready for a home game. The highly anticipated first game at brand new Raymond James Stadium saw the Buccaneers host the Bears. After falling behind 15–0 at halftime, Tampa Bay scored 27 unanswered points to win 27–15. Dave Moore caught a one-handed pass for a 44-yard touchdown in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Warrick Dunn ran for a 44-yard touchdown. Raymond James Stadium was opened with a victory, and the Buccaneers improved to 1–2.\n\nWeek 4: at Detroit Lions\n\nOn Monday Night Football, Tampa Bay faced Detroit at the Silverdome. Despite clinging to a 6–3 deficit at halftime, Tampa Bay’s sputtering offense and defensive miscues cost any chance at victory. Barry Sanders rushed for 131 yards, Bryant Westbrook returned an interception 34 yards for a touchdown, and Terry Fair returned a Lions record 105-yard kickoff return touchdown. Two apparent touchdown passes by Trent Dilfer were called back for penalty, and Tampa Bay fell 27–6.\n\nWeek 5: New York Giants\n\nOnly a minute and a half into the game, Charles Mincy intercepted Kanell for a 22-yard touchdown return. Tampa Bay would never trail in the game. The Buccaneer defense held the Giants to only 135 total yards, and picked off Kanell three times in the 20–3 victory.\n\nWeek 7: Carolina Panthers\n\nTampa Bay evened their record to 3–3 with a win over Carolina. The Panthers led 13–3 in the fourth quarter, but Trent Dilfer led the Buccaneers for a rally in the final 5 minutes. On a roll out, Dilfer ran in for a 1-yard touchdown, then on the next possession, scored the go-ahead touchdown. Karl Williams caught a 29-yard touchdown pass in the corner of the endzone with 1:39 to go to seal the victory 16–13.\n\nThe Buccaneers improved to 3–0 at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nWeek 8: at New Orleans Saints\n\nThe Tampa Bay offense dropped seven passes, Patrick Hape lost a fumble at the Saints 3-yard line, and Trent Dilfer threw an interception, as offensive futility again plagued the Buccaneers, resulting in a 9–3 loss at New Orleans. Three times the Buccaneers had the ball inside the Saints 25-yard line, but came up with zero points. At one point, Bert Emanuel caught a touchdown pass, but the officials ruled it incomplete, saying he “trapped” the ball against the turf.\n\nWeek 9: Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe Vikings entered week 9 at Tampa Bay undefeated at 7–0. Derrick Brooks intercepted Randal Cunningham, setting up Warrick Dunn's first touchdown run. A back and forth game saw the score tied 17–17 at halftime. Minnesota took a 24–17 lead in the third quarter, but Tampa Bay came back in the fourth. A field goal followed by a Mike Alstott touchdown run with just under six minutes remaining gave the Bucs a 27–24 lead. The Buccaneers had two rushers over 100 yards: Alstott (128) and Dunn (115), with Alstott sealing the game late with a rush of 38 yards.\n\nTampa Bay defeated Minnesota 27–24, the Vikings’ first loss and only one during the regular season. The Bucs remained at 0.500, improving to 4–4, and were now 4–0 at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nWeek 10: Tennessee Oilers\n\nTampa Bay held a 16-3 halftime lead, but trailing 24–22 at the two-minute warning, Tennessee was facing 3rd down & 8 at their own 29-yard line. A defensive stop by Tampa Bay would have given them the ball back, and an opportunity to drive for a game-winning field goal. However, quarterback Steve McNair broke out for a game-icing 71-yard touchdown run, and the Tennessee Oilers won 31–22.\n\nWeek 11: at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nTampa Bay was leading 24–23 with three minutes remaining. Fred Taylor broke out for a 70-yard touchdown run with 2:40 left, and Jacksonville won 29–24.\n\nWeek 12: Detroit Lions\n\nTampa Bay trailed 21–7, but rallied late. With just over two minutes remaining, Trent Dilfer drove the Buccaneers to the Detroit 11-yard line. He was intercepted in the endzone, and Detroit held on to win 28–25. It was Tampa Bay's third straight loss.\n\nWeek 13: at Chicago Bears\n\nTampa Bay got back to their winning ways, winning their first road game of the season at Chicago. Late in the second quarter, the Buccaneers blocked a Bears punt, and Ronde Barber scooped it up. He returned the ball 21 yards for a touchdown. As time expired in the first half, Trent Dilfer threw up a Hail Mary touchdown, which was caught by Brice Hunter, his first career NFL touchdown. The Bucs took a 21–14 lead into halftime, and won the game 31–17.\n\nTampa Bay's record was now 5–7, still alive for the wild card hunt.\n\nWeek 14: Green Bay Packers\n\nTampa Bay hosted Green Bay in their first Monday Night Football home game since 1982. The Buccaneers forced 8 fumbles, and sacked Brett Favre 8 times. Late in the first quarter, Trent Dilfer connected to Jacquez Green for a 64-yard touchdown pass. Minutes later, at the beginning of the second quarter, Dilfer passed to Bert Emanuel in a nearly identical 62-yard touchdown pass. Leading 17–15 in the fourth quarter, Dilfer scrambled through the middle of the Packers defensive line to score a 6-yard touchdown, and a 24–15 lead. Green bay would trim the deficit to 24–22, but the Buccaneers held on to win.\n\nTampa Bay improved to 6–7 on the season.\n\nWeek 15: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nTampa Bay won their third game in a row, shutting down the Steelers to just 168 yard of offense. The Tampa Bay defense intercepted Kordell Stewart three times, and Mike Tomczak once. Mike Alstott ran for 78 yards on a wet and rainy day. The Steelers only points came early in the fourth quarter. After four tries, this was Tampa Bay's first win over Pittsburgh in team history.\n\nTampa Bay won 16–3 and evened their record at 7–7. They were now back in the hunt for the wild card.\n\nWeek 16: at Washington Redskins\n\nTampa Bay's playoff chances were dealt a big blow in the Week 16 loss at Washington. Tampa Bay led the Redskins 16–7 early in the fourth quarter, but blew the lead at the end. Leading 16–13 with six minutes to go, Jacquez Green fumbled a kickoff, turning the ball over. On the next play, Stephen Alexander caught the game-winning touchdown for Washington. Tampa Bay had two last chances to come back, but both times, Trent Dilfer threw interceptions.\n\nThe Buccaneers fell to 7–8 on the season, and would need to win in week 17 to keep their playoff hopes alive.\n\nWeek 17: at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nTampa Bay clobbered Cincinnati 35–0, a franchise best for a road shutout. Mike Alstott scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Bucs defense intercepted the Bengals twice (including a 56-yard return by Ronde Barber)\n\nTampa Bay finished 8–8 on the season, winning four out of their last five games, and the end of the game, were still alive for an NFC wild card spot. Tampa Bay needed the Giants to beat the Eagles and the Chargers to beat the Cardinals . The Giants won, helping Tampa Bay, but the Cardinals beat the Chargers 16–13 with a 52-yard field goal as time expired. By the time the Buccaneers' plane had landed back in Tampa, they were ousted from the playoffs.\n\nStandings\n\n[1] Stroud, Rick. ‘5 Plays the Bucs Wish Hadn’t Happened’. _St. Petersburg Times_, Nov. 29, 1998.\n\n[2] \n",

    "passage": "Tad Hollerith and the Crystal Radio Gang:\nChapter the First\n\nTad’s first summer at Wiki-Wak found him quite worried who his tent-mates might be. He opened the flap warily and peered inside. The smell of musty canvas hit him in a wave. He squinted his eyes and caught sight of something in the darkness. A smallish boy with black hair and horn rimmed glasses peered back at him grinning. As his retinas acclimated Tad observed that he appeared to be tinkering on some sort of disassembled gadgetry.\n\n“Greetings!” said the boy congenially. “The name’s Kip Keegan” he stated proudly, holding out a grimy hand. \n\nTad shook it anyway to be polite, and then wiped his own on his trousers.\n\n“Tad Hollerith”\n\n“Hollerith. The name rings a bell. Goodness, what happened to your hands?”\n\n“Oh….” Said Tad embarrassed, pulling down his jacket sleeves. “Quick” he thought “make a joke of it.”\n\n“I got into a fight with a furnace”\n\n“Ha!” said Kip, looking at Tad with an expression of disbelief.\n\nTad quickly changed the subject. “Have any of the other Bunk Mates shown up?”\n\n“Brewster came and went awhile ago. Should be back soon. He’s something else, I tell ya. We met here last year. I haven’t seen hide nor hair of the other fellow yet, though. Hope he’s not one of those Meat-heads from the Rugby Squad.”\n\nTad was warming up to him already. Any hater of those idiots was automatically friend material as far as he was concerned. Kip sat back down on his cot and continued working on the small contraption. Tad was officially intrigued.\n\n“What is that pray tell?”\n\n“Oh, this ole thing? It’s supposed to be a mini-transistor radio. I built it last year with various parts I nicked from the engineering dept. Been awhile since it worked though. I stumbled upon it in my desk while packing. Thought it might be worth a shot if I could get it receiving again.”\n\nTad had heard about this new fangled technology called radio, but his knowledge about it was minimal. He had seen one at the Dungleburg fair once, paying a penny for the privilege of joining an audience of awed spectators who gathered around a hulking machine to listen to it play a staticy rendition of “Stars and Stripes Forever”. He was never quite sure how it worked though. Something about invisible wavelengths of energy plucked right from the ether by means of antennae receivers.”\n\n“Incredible.”\n\nKip laughed. “You should see the Transatlantic Receiver I’m building back at Dun. When I finally get together enough scratch to mail order the parts, I’m going to be talking to chaps in France! Wouldn’t that be bully? Now where’d I put my watchmaker’s kit?” he said, digging around in his trunk. “Aha!”\n\n“How does it work?”\n\n(Kip goes on to give an elementary explanation of Radio Science)\n\n“Remarkable”\n“I think so at least. Good to meet someone as amazed by it as I.”\n\nJust then the tent flap flew open with a flourish. In burst a tall, lanky lad with flush face. It appeared as if he had been in a hurry.\n\n“Kip, Worthington’s got a full carton of Sassafras Doodles, we gotta shit and get while the…”\n\nHis voice dropped off suddenly upon catching sight of Tad.\n\n“Oh, blast…”\n\n“It’s OK Brewster,” explained Kip “this here’s our new Tent-mate Tad Hollerith. He seems on the level. Tad, meet Brewster McNutridge, alchemist extraordinaire.”\n\n“What have I told you about referring to me with that term. I’m not trying to turn shit to gold here! It’s chemistry kip, chemistry! Not alchemy.”\n\n“As you wish Nicolas Flammel” said Kip mischievously.\n\n“Why I oughta….” said Brewster, shaking his fist in Kip’s face jokingly.\n\n“Tad Hollerith huh? Is this your first year at Shitty-Shak?”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\n“Is this your first instance of attending camp?”\n\n“Yes”\n\nBrewster shot a sideways glance at Kip. “Oh boy…”\n\n“What?” implored Tad nervously.\n\n“Uhh, nothing, you’ll find out soon enough.”\n\nTad’s brow furrowed. Kip immediately attempted to assuage his anxiety.\n\n“Don’t fret chum, we’ll stick with ya. Camp can be rather rough on the average neophyte, but your fellow tent-mates will be there every step of the way.”\n\nTad had met few boys his age so friendly. Most teased or bullied him for his physical weakness and delicate personality. To meet someone so congenial was quite a relief.\n\nKip eventually abandoned hope on the transistor, and the 3 boys began unpacking and tidying the tent for opening inspection. While they organized and swept, Brewster told several dirty jokes, one of which caused Tad to laugh out loud, something he did very seldom. He was beginning to consider how lucky he was to have such tent-mates, when the boys heard a terrible commotion outside.\n\n“Let me go!” screeched the voice of a young boy.\n\n“Stand up you little whelp, or I will be forced to thrash you again!” bellowed the voice of a man.\n\n“If you so much as come near me with that switch I will notify my parents immediately, you…you insufferable brute!”\n\nSuddenly came the sickening sound of flexible twig striking yielding flesh. The boy wailed in agony.\n\nThe 3 boys in the tent could hear footsteps crunching toward their tent.\n\n“Get in there!” snarled the counselor, shoving the boy through the flap violently.\n“Perhaps next time you shall know your place!” and with that he stomped off in a huff.\n\nTad and the others gathered round the wounded boy. Kip put out a hand to help, but the frightened creature swatted it away. “No! Don’t touch me!”\n\n“It’s OK chum, I’m not going to hurt you. Is this your assigned tent?”\n\n“Guess so…” mumbled the sniffling boy. As he looked up at them with teary eyes the others could see a bloody, diagonal slice traveling from his left eyebrow, across his nose, and all the way down to his right jawbone. His left eye was already beginning to swell shut.\n\n“Merciful heavens,” said Tad aghast. “Did that counselor just do that to you?”\n\n“No” said the boy sarcastically “I ran into a rosebush”\n\n“Here” said Brewster, handing the boy a dampened washcloth. “Put some pressure on that, its still bleeding”. The boy took the rag and pressed it up against his wound.\n\n“Thank you” he croaked\n\n“What happened?” asked Kip, in genuine concern.\n\n“Oh, it was nothing.”\n\n“I say a switch to the face is much more than nothing”\n\n“Jeez, would you lay off. I got into a tiff with one of those brutes out there. I told them over and over that I am not supposed to be here, but damned if they’d listen. Incredulous wretches! Once I’m able to successfully contact my father, he’ll have their jobs, every last one of them!”\n\nBrewster shot another knowing glance Kip’s way. “Come now,” he said “let’s get you off the floor. Tad, can you lend a hand?” \n\nTad assisted his new tent-mate to his feet and over to the empty cot. They removed his boots and propped him up with extra pillows.\n\n“Uhhnnn….those fiends….those miserable bastards…how dare they?”\n\n“Here, have a swig of this” said Kip, brandishing a large glass phial. “It’s medicine. It will help you feel better.”\n\nThe injured lad took a big swig and nearly spit it out. “Dear god, what is that swill?”\n\n“It’s Doctor Farmington’s Patented Nerve Tonic. It has a bit of opium in it. I got it last year when I had whooping cough. Never used it much but I thought it might come in handy.”\n\n“Say…” said Brewster. “How’s about letting yer ole pal Brewst get a tug of that?”\n\n“Not today.”\n\nA few minutes later the wound stopped seeping. The boy’s breath grew deeper, and he seemed a bit more calm, considering the circumstances. Just as he was about to nod off Brewster whispered a query.\n\n“Hey kid…psst…”\n\nThe boy looked up at him with his one good eye.\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\n“Dewey. Dewey Gillespie. Heir to the Great Gillespie Fortune.”\n\nAnd with that he fell headlong into sweet slumber.\n",

    "passage": "Mike Mollo\n\nMIKE MOLLO (born February 11, 1980 in Oak Lawn, Illinois) is an American former professional boxer in the heavyweight division. A fan favorite for his aggressive style in Chicago, Mollo is perhaps best known for his bouts with Polish fighters Art Binkowski, Artur Szpilka, Andrew Golota, and Krzysztof Zimnoch. He was managed by Darnell Nicholson.\n\n\nBackground\n\nBorn into a working class Italian family in Chicago's south suburbs, Mollo got into numerous scuffles on the streets of his neighborhood. Already 230 pounds as a 14-year-old, he was quickly taken to the local boxing club to hone his skills, and apply his energy in a more constructive manner.[1]\n\n\nProfessional career\n\nAfter a brief amateur career, “Merciless” Mike Mollo made his professional debut on June 25, 2000, scoring a first-round knockout over Terry Coffin in Elgin, Illinois. Over the following years, Mollo built his professional record while also working full-time as a bricklayer and tuckpointer. Wildly popular with Chicago fight fans, Mollo used his hard-punching, aggressive style to win 19 of his first 20 professional bouts. His first loss was to heavyweight contender DaVarryl Williamson.\n\nOn October 7, 2006, Mollo scored his biggest win, knocking out Kevin McBride (best known for defeating Mike Tyson) by a TKO 30 seconds into the second round.[2]\n\nAfter a second-round TKO of Art Binkowski, Mollo faced 40-year old former world title challenger Andrew Golota. Mollo lost via unanimous decision.\n\nOne of more Mollo's more high-profile matchups was his two bouts against then-undefeated and future WBC world title challenger Artur Szpilka. Despite being a heavy underdog in the first fight and not having competed for two years prior to the bout, Mollo was able to knock down Szpilka before being knocked out in the sixth round. The two faced off again six months later, with Mollo again knocking Szpilka down early in the match before being finished in the fifth round via TKO.\n\nThree years after his second loss to Szpilka, Mollo faced another Polish fighter, Krzysztof Zimnoch. In a significant upset, Mollo knocked out the 18-0-1 Zimnoch in the first round to win the vacant Republic of Poland International Heavyweight title. From this win, Mollo earned a shot at Andriy Rudenko's WBC Silver International Heavyweight title. Mollo was defeated via unanimous decision.\n\nMollo then faced off against Krzysztof Zimnoch in a rematch from the year before. Mollo lost the rematch via corner stoppage.\n\nOn March 1, 2017, Mollo officially announced his retirement from professional boxing.\n\n\nInfluences\n\nEarly in his career, Mollo gained the support of Rocky Marciano’s family. “I understand that Mike wants to emulate Rocky both in and out of the ring”, noted Peter Marciano, younger brother of the “Brockton Blockbuster”. Mollo remembers Marciano well. “I grew up watching fight films of Rocky Marciano. Both of our families came from Naples, Italy, so Rocky was a hero to my family.

    "passage": "The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City filed the lawsuit at noon today, asserting that the organizers’ consecrated Host is Church property and was obtained fraudulently.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — Attorneys for the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City filed a lawsuit at noon today to stop the Satanic \"black mass\" that organizers are planning to stage next month in the Oklahoma City Civic Center Music Hall.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the Oklahoma County Sheriff‘s Office to retrieve the consecrated Host that the event‘s organizers claim to have and return it to Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul Coakley. The lawsuit also argues that the consecrated Host was obtained under fraudulent circumstances, and thus it must be returned to the archdiocese.\n\n“Our contention is that they are in possession of stolen property,” Archbishop Coakley told the Register. “They cannot complete their Satanic ritual without a consecrated Host, and they have no means of acquiring one except through theft. We are asking the court to order them to return it immediately to me.”\n\nArchbishop Coakley added that the archdiocese, in consulting with the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, formulated a sound argument rooted in canon and civil law.\n\n“We are trusting the court will recognize that and act accordingly,” the archbishop said. “We hope this is a way that we can prevent the desecration of the Eucharist from taking place by removing from their possession what they have obtained illegally, that is the consecrated Host.”\n\nMichael Caspino, one of two attorneys who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the archdiocese in Oklahoma District Court, said the legal argument for the case is simple: “A consecrated Eucharist belongs to the Church.”\n\nCaspino, the CEO and partner at the Busch & Caspino law firm in Irvine, Calif., told the Register that the Church has exercised “dominion and control” over the Eucharist for more than 2,000 years. The lawsuit provides information on Church processes set up to safeguard the consecrated Host.\n\n“The Satanists procured the consecrated Host by illicit means, theft or fraud,” Caspino said. “We are simply asking the court to return the stolen property to its rightful owner, the Roman Catholic Church.”\n\nNamed as defendants are Adam Daniels, an Oklahoma County resident, and Dakhma of Angra Mainyu, a group that has rented the Oklahoma City Civic Center’s 88-seat City Theater to stage the black mass on Sept. 21. Daniels, a member of Dakhma of Angra Mainyu, has told various media outlets that a friend mailed him the consecrated Host and that it will be desecrated, “stomped on” and destroyed during the Satanic ritual.\n\nDaniels, who has been involved in organizing public Satanist events in Oklahoma City since 2010, is a registered sex offender.\n\nContacted by the Register, Daniels struck a defiant tone. He called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said it was meant to intimidate him from holding the black mass. He said the archdiocese's efforts will backfire.\n\n\"It will not work. We are not canceling. We are moving forward,\" said Daniels, who also threatened to \"sue everybody I can sue\" for defamation of character. He added that the court has 14 days to serve him with the lawsuit.\n\n\"They have two weeks to serve me, if they can find me,\" Daniels said.\n\nPROFANATION OF THE CATHOLIC MASS\n\nThe black mass is a sacrilegious ceremony structured in imitation of the Catholic Mass. Invoking Satan, the ritual is centered around the desecration of the Eucharist, which is generally done by stealing a consecrated Host from a Catholic church and using it in a profane sexual ritual or defecating and urinating on it. On its website, the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu says its event will be “toned down” so as not to violate Oklahoma state laws against nudity, public urination and sex acts.\n\nThe Oklahoma black mass has generated outrage among Catholics across the country. More than 50,000 people have signed an online petition to shut down the event. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallon released a statement on Aug. 11 condemning the black mass as a “disgusting mockery of the Catholic faith” that should be “equally repellent to Catholics and non-Catholics alike.”\n\nThe situation in Oklahoma comes just three months after a Harvard University student club tried sponsoring a black mass on campus. Hundreds of Catholics from across Massachusetts and New England participated in a May 12 procession and Eucharistic Holy Hour in the Church of St. Paul in Harvard Yard. The Harvard student club subsequently canceled the black mass, though a scaled-down version of it, without the club’s sponsorship, was reportedly later held in an off-campus Chinese restaurant.\n\nArchbishop Coakley said the publicly planned black mass in Oklahoma surprised him and many others, given that Oklahoma is a “very conservative state,” with many churchgoing people.\n\n“It seems as if it would be an unlikely place for such an attack to take place,” Archbishop Coakley said. “Unfortunately, it has indeed taken up a lot of our time, energy and attention to resist this, but if we are able to stop this, it will be time and energy well spent.”\n\nThe archbishop also said he is encouraged by numerous messages that he has received from virtually every continent, expressing support and solidarity with the Oklahoma Catholic community.\n\n“I’m kind of holding my breath to see what’s next and see what becomes of [the lawsuit],” he said. “I’m hopeful, praying that it will achieve the end for which we desire, which is the prevention of the desecration of the Eucharist and stopping this public sacrilege from taking place.”\n\nTHE LEGAL ARGUMENT\n\nThe legal argument in today’s lawsuit partly frames the consecrated-Host issue as a matter of property rights. It essentially argues that the Catholic Church, through its sacramental theology and Code of Canon Law, sets the conditions for how the Eucharist is consecrated, distributed to the faithful and reposed. Anyone who deliberately obtains a consecrated Host under illicit circumstances, either through sneaking it through the Communion line or outright stealing it, violates the Church’s legal right to regulate its internal life.\n\n“The Church is asking for the protection of its most basic right, namely not to have its sacraments used inappropriately. In civil law, Archbishop Coakley is acting as a responsible steward of the Eucharist. The Church enjoys the same protection of civil law that any other entity would enjoy,” said J.D. Flynn, a canon lawyer based in Lincoln, Neb. \n\nFlynn told the Register that canon law spells out what is appropriate and inappropriate reception of the Eucharist. Anyone who discards a consecrated Host or retains it for a sacrilegious purpose incurs an automatic excommunication that can only be redressed by the Holy See.\n\n“If anyone obtains the host for sacrilegious purpose, they are violating the tenets by which the Eucharist is governed in the context of our Church,” Flynn said. “And the right of free exercise of religion allows us to administer the Eucharist in the context of the governing documents of our Church.”\n\nThe five-page lawsuit, as well as an accompanying declaration written by Dominican Father Joseph Fox, an expert in canon law, explain the theology behind the Eucharist and the various disciplines the Church has developed over its 2,000-year history to ensure the integrity and protection of consecrated Hosts.\n\nFor example, the documents say that only a validly ordained priest can consecrate the Eucharist and that ministers of holy Communion need permission to take consecrated Hosts outside a church building for specific pastoral purposes.\n\nFather Fox writes that the Catholic Church “maintains ownership of all consecrated Hosts throughout the world” and that, to Catholics, the consecrated Host, making the person of Jesus Christ himself physically present, “is the most sacred, respected and revered thing in the world.”\n\nThe defendants, the lawsuit adds, “do not have consent or authorization” from Archbishop Coakley — who is tasked to safeguard the Church‘s property — to possess a consecrated Host outside the church. The lawsuit is seeking a court order that the defendants not consume, damage or profane the consecrated Host, if they indeed possess one. \n\n‘INCALCULABLE’ COST\n\nThe archdiocese is also asking the dheriff of Oklahoma County to take possession of the consecrated Host and return it to Archbishop Coakley. The “actual cost” of the Eucharist, the lawsuit adds, is “incalculable, because the significance and importance of the consecrated Host cannot be measured monetarily.”\n\n“We are honored to represent Archbishop Coakley in this fight against the desecration of the Blessed Sacrament,” Caspino said. “The archbishop should be lauded for his courageous stance against the enemies of the Church.”\n\nArchbishop Coakley has previously asked that the Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel be said at the end of every Mass, beginning on the feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord on Aug. 6 and continuing through the feast of the Archangels on Sept. 29. The archbishop has also requested that individual Catholics and parishes make Eucharistic Holy Hours “to avert this sacrilege and publicly manifest our faith in the Lord and our loving gratitude for the gift of the Holy Eucharist, the source and summit of our lives.”\n\n_Register correspondent Brian Fraga writes from Fall River, Massachusetts._\n",

    "passage": "To Ponder\n\nThis is part five of an eleven-part novella that I wrote about a year ago. They all work as stand-alones as well, so I thought I'd test the reddit waters first by posting this (this is my first post), then if there's interest, I'll start from the beginning. \n\n\n“See that man on the bench? The one who keeps checking his watch?”\n\n            “Yeah, I see him. Think I should aim for him? Because I was thinking more that bus of school children that passes by here every day around this time. Could you imagine man, all those little kids watching something like that? If only we were exposed to such things at their age.”\n\n            “Well, as good for them as it may be, trust me. Go for the old man. He comes by here almost every day and he needs this more than any piece of shit kid.”\n\n            “I trust you, so old man it is. How much longer?”\n\n            “Few minutes, give or take how much of impact you plan to make.”       \n\n            “Ha. I’m sure you’ll know just as well as I will.”\n\n            “You know what kind of impact we’re speaking of, right? You could change a lot of opinions if you don’t screw this up.”\n\n            “What kind of opinions are we talking about here? The kinds of opinions that are swayed by an act as simple as what I’m about to do? We don’t need those kinds of people. If they don’t believe in it themselves and don’t arrive there on their own terms after whatever hardships they’ve traversed, then it’s useless anyway. Don’t follow the leader who jumps off of a building.”\n\n            With those last words, I run to the edge and after seven well-placed steps, I leap towards the sky below, 80 stories down. I did it. I finally did it. Oh shit I did it, I jumped. I jumped. Shit shit shit I jumped why did I jump SHIT I JUMPED. Ok, ok, just…just…remember. Why am I doing this? To better myself and no one else. Why no one else? Because every single entity I’ve encountered thus far has only been an extension of me and by denying myself a couple decades spent living, I’m presenting a gift to the whole of my species, the gift of a clean mental slate.\n\n           \n\n                                                            -755ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            So I’m about to die. Well, I’ve been about to die ever since I was born, but this is simply the closest I’ve come. No, wait, now this is the closest I’ve come. No, now. Now. Now. No, stop, I can’t thought-loop my psyche when every misplaced image can’t be painted over. Death…the detachment of the personality from the corpse, the awkward pauses in conversation where I can feel my eyes grow just that much heavier; the ultimate lucid dream. Being so close to it now, I can understand at the same level as I did when I first gave my life ending any serious thought; that complete, yet incomplete notion of existing while non-existing, the essence of white space, the daydream that lasts into the night.\n\n            My way of imagining it has always correlated to a recurring dream that I’ve had since I was maybe 4 or 5 years old. In this dream, I exist in a realm of utter nothingness. In this realm, no matter what direction you take or whatever actions lead your limbs, the effect is about as apparent as the cause is discernible. In this state of existence, time has no beginning and has no end. Everything around me is blank and the best way to describe it would be empty space. I am here for a reason and this reason comes to me in a complete thought, as if I experienced the idea all at once; in a realm without time, surely not inconceivable. The thought consists of a person who I haven’t met yet at that point in my life but I now recognize as someone close to me who needs my help. I attempt to speak and no words come out, but the blanket of space that has been keeping me docile is slightly rumpled and what is revealed is a bio-dome of sorts. Don’t get me wrong, the empty space remains and it feels alone, but a few bushes and trees exist alongside me in this new mental world. I begin to run and I can see numbers in my head counting down from ten. The first few seconds seem to take a lifetime, yet each individual nano-second is split into the mere act of breathing and non-breathing until everything is so sped up that my life is lived and re-lived multiple times.\n\n            Whatever I’m moving towards could represent multiple things now that I look back on it, but at the time, it was just a person. Perhaps it was the attention or simply the act of looking my way; perhaps it represented a too- ignored side of me; but with this person seeming to be at risk for something grave, the strain on my psyche during the dream was staggering. So I’m attempting to run to this person because I need to save them no matter what and everything begins to slow down. My screams echo throughout the void and a bush catches my leg, causing me to trip. I can’t stand up and all I can hear are thousands upon thousands of numbers crashing through my mind. Once zero is reached, everything becomes still and my blood ceases circulation. Someone starts to cry and I no longer exist as a human being. I become part of the whiteness, part of the nothingness one could say. To be there while not being there simultaneously is a fascinating place to be.\n\n            Coming out of the dream, I was always left in the same state for sometimes days. Time has no meaning and there’s this pressure that’s alleviated from my thought process. Over the years, I explored that place and each visit became a little more distant, a little less focused until eventually, I could achieve that bliss by closing my eyes and blocking out all thought.\n\n            Something hits me in the arm and tears right through it. I can feel the muscles tear as follicles and pores are ripped apart and my blood starts to stain the windows that pass me by on my descent. I think I hit a bird. Yes. I jumped off of a building and the first thing I hit isn’t the ground, but a bird.\n\n \n\n                                                            -620ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            Better to hit a bird than be shit on one during my fall. I couldn’t even imagine, being shit on right after I die. Actually, I would very much like that. Surely something I would brag about to friends if I woke up. What am I thinking, ‘if I woke up’. That’s the kind of thinking that led to a developed world and a developed world is what led to the death of everything else. Earth would’ve been heavily changed by the dominant species no matter what and even though the newspapers and anchormen always say that we’re killing the planet, no, we’re not. We’re making it unsuitable for human life and evidently, much more than that. The planet will be just fine. We will be just fine. In the over-arching outline of all that ever is, we were dead much longer than we were alive and a return to normalcy may be what the current civilization needs.\n\n            To kill a planet- to assume that once all human life is gone, all life stops until someone is there to observe it. The conscious observer is just as bad as the conscientious objector and with both out of the way, maybe a pair of eyes will be able to appreciate something, anything, without either martyring it or attempting to organize an intrinsically chaotic system. Order comes from chaos and chaos from order; man from society and society from man. In both cases, one seems to be in control of the other. In both cases, that one is what spends a majority of its span as the unwilling, sleeping guise of the other.\n\n \n\n                                                            -560ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            Someone must be watching me right now. Someone is seeing this body fall to the street. I’m sure that there has to be at least one parent covering the eyes of a child. I hope my body bounces and hits that parent in the face. Yes, I know that parents think they reserve the right to shield their children from the horrors of this world, but children need just as much violence and terror exposure as they need tenderness and love. The kids that I’ve seen grow up since I’ve been aware enough to observe with patience have been all but blocked out from seeing anything worthwhile. This is almost certainly not true worldwide and if it is, then I thank the lack of morality in the past few years for leading us to this, but children in this day and age lack almost every universally accepted attribute that make up for a stable, future-privileged human being. The people who grew up into leaders, thinkers, builders, artists, were not told to sit inside all day and watch someone who’s paid to entertain them. The technological advances that have been made within a generation have essentially changed the way that humans are raised in every single way. Humans aren’t raised in any way similar to what once passed for culturing a being.\n\n            Everyone who can’t read or write is looked down upon; everyone who is without basic computer literacy is labeled backwards, obsolete; everyone who is without a job and an education, ostracized to the point where it’s a sub-culture on its own. The thing is, that describes almost the entire human species. Instead of being raised to develop into a healthy person with creative outlets chosen by the individual and paths taken at will, we’re all on mood-altering something or other and the outlets chosen are the outlets bought. We just plug in and absorb, whether it be the musings of Bukowski or the tales of Serling. No matter how high in regard the medium is kept, it is still nothing more than a medium, there to meet you half-way and keep you there until you create for yourself or imitate other imitators.\n\n            Feathers are pulled by the wind and out of my outstretched arms. From the ground, I must look like some sort of falling angel.\n\n \n\n                                                            -415ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            Out of everyone I’ve ever met, I wonder how many of them will realize that their last time seeing me was the last time that they’d ever see me. I’ve personally never been to a funeral, but I might as well show up to my own.\n\n \n\n                                                            -350ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            The open cut on my arm is being lacerated by the air flowing around it.\n\n            It doesn’t pain me at all. Not much pains me at this point. My mind is clear and my sympathetic nervous system – as calm as it’s ever been. At my rate of descent, I should be hitting the ground any second now. The old man better have stayed on that bench; he’ll be needing this. This all feels too surreal. If time as we understand it is truly a fundamental law that governs us, then I should have hit the ground ages ago. As much control as I have over the rate at which I perceive the world around me, it seems almost implausible that one could fall for this long. A single step, followed by a long fall; a single dream followed by a long awakening.\n\n \n\n                                                            -235ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            This is it, any moment now and it will be complete. The wind resistance can only resist me for so long. Try as hard as anyone may, for to stop something this long in the making, one would need to reset humanity itself. In my most optimistic reasoning, would that necessarily be such a bad thing? Sure, the road moving towards me may not exist, but neither would the workers who built the road, the parents who raised the workers. The immigrants who wanted something better and the ones set on making something worse for the better.\n\n \n\n                                                            -110ft to Destination-\n\n \n\n            Where will these thoughts go once I hit the pavement? They can’t be lost to the clouds or oceans; can’t be found by the travelers or the beggars. If I regard myself as no more than an idea, then I will spend the rest of eternity lingering with my internal voice. My thoughts aren’t just spawned within myself and forgotten once I’m gone; it can’t be as simple as that. They must exist elsewhere, a place where the ideas that bring about species-wide revolutions in cognitive-ability and mutual understanding go to await the next cycle of patience-enabled statues. Some call it the collective unconscious and others just refer to it as deep-space, but I prefer to imagine the place where my concepts and ideas go to live out their usefulness as a realm readily available to anyone able to tap into potential, tap into my limited awareness and expand it beyond recognition. If what I’ve learned is still able to grow long after I’m dead, then maybe they won’t be Event #4. Maybe they’ll prosper.",

    "passage": "Surfactant protein B\n\nSURFACTANT PROTEIN B is an essential lipid-associated protein found in pulmonary surfactant. Without it, the lung would not be able to inflate after a deep breath out.[1] It rearranges lipid molecules in the fluid lining the lung so that tiny air sacs in the lung, called alveoli, can more easily inflate.[2]\n\n\nGene\n\nSP-B is encoded by _SFTPB_, a single, 11425 nucleotide long gene on chromosome 2.[3] Mutations in this gene are the basis for several of the lung conditions mentioned above. Both frameshift mutations and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found correlated to a variety of lung conditions. A frame shift mutation responsible for congenital alveolar proteinosis (CAP) was identified by Kattan et al.[4] Many SNP's have been identified in relation to lung conditions. They have been correlated to severe influenza, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation necessity, and more.[5]\n\n\nProtein\n\nSurfactant protein B (SP-B) is a small protein, weighing about 8 kDa.[6] Proteins are composed of building blocks called amino acids, and SP-B is composed of 79 of them (Valine, alanine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophan being found in the highest levels). Nine of these carry with them a positive charge, and two carry a negative charge, leaving a protein with a net (total) charge of +7.[7] In the body, two molecules of SP-B stick together and form what is called a homodimer.[8] These are found embedded into membranes and other lipid structures, SP-B is a highly hydrophobic, avoiding contact with water.\n\nSP-B is the mature form of a large precursor protein called proSP-B. Synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of type II pneumocytes, proSP-B weighs approximately 40 kDa and is cut down to the size of mature SP-B in the golgi apparatus through a process called post-translational modification.[9] ProSP-B is also created in another type of lung cell called a Club cell, but these cells are unable to edit proSP-B into SP-B.[10]\n\nSP-B is a saposin-like protein, which is a group of related proteins known particularly for binding to membranes with negative charges and facilitating either the fusion or lysis (breaking) of the membrane. More well known proteins in this family include saposin-C, NK-lysin, and amoebopore.[11]\n\n\nFunction\n\nSP-B plays a critical role in the functioning of healthy lungs, and its absence inevitably leads to lung conditions, most common of which being acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of this, SP-B's function has been well researched, and has been found to exist in three parts. Beyond these three functions, it is worth noting that SP-B is also thought to have some anti-inflammatory function, though it is not well defined.[12]\n\nIndirect surface tension reduction\n\nThe surface tension at the border between the fluid lining and the inhaled gas (gas/fluid interface) in alveoli determines the motion of the alveoli as a whole. According to Lapace's Law, high surface tension in the gas/fluid interface of alveoli prevents the alveoli from inflating, which causes lung collapse.[13] lipid arrangement in the fluid lining of alveoli is the primary determining factor of this surface tension since the lipids form a thin film (monolayer) on the surface of the fluid lining at the gas/fluid interface. Different lipids allow for different ranges of motion and can be compacted different.\n\nSP-B plays a role in this by selected certain lipids and inserting them into the gas/fluid interface. The lipid shown to be most needed on this surface (Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) does not easily move to the gas/fluid interface, but SP-B helps ease and speed up this process.[14]\n\nSP-B also indirectly reduces surface tension by organizing the lipids underneath the surface of the gas/fluid interface in structures called tubular myelin.[15] Effectively, SP-B cuts and pastes pieces of the lipid bilayers to form the three dimensional structure of the tubular myelin. This structure is the support and lipid source for the gas/fluid interface, where surface tension is a critical factor in lung function.\n\nDirect surface tension reduction\n\nBeyond arranging lipids in a way that reduces surface tension, SP-B actually directly interferes with attractive forces between water molecules.[16] This disruption in the cohesion of water minimizes further the surface tension at the gas/fluid interface.\n\nFormation of lamellar bodies\n\nLamellar bodies are groups of lipids and protein that are structurally similar to tubular myelin, but are found inside instead of outside the type II pneumocytes. Similarly to its function in organizing tubular myelin, SP-B arranges lipids into the lamellar body structure.[17] Basically, SP-B plays a role in the organogenesis (formation of structure) of lamellar bodies. The lamellar bodies are then secreted into the fluid lining the interior of alveoli, and become tubular myelin. This role is critical for making pulmonary surfactant (see below)\n\nSP-B Deficiencies and Issues\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory syncytial virus infection, familial lung disease, and pneumocystis infection are examples of deficiencies in and issues with SP-B that are correlated with lung issues.[18]\n\nBecause so many lung conditions are associated with issues around SP-B, synthetic replacements have been researched, created, and manufactured. It has been shown that 21 amino acid long peptides with positive charge and intermittent hydrophobic regions mimicking SP-B can minimize surface tension at the gas/fluid interface, and surfactant replacements for surfactant deficient patients has been used to save lives.[19][20]\n\nOnce lung distress has occurred, SP-B has been shown to be effective as a biomarker in the blood stream.[21] Higher levels of SP-B indicate some kind of lung distress, and can even indicate if the patient is currently a smoker.[22] This may be useful in the future to predict atherosclerosis, a solidifying of vascular tissue that has negative effects on the heart.\n\n\nContext in surfactant\n\nSP-B is a critical protein for lung function, and is found in the context of pulmonary surfactant. Understanding surfactant is important to gaining a full understanding of SP-B. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins that coats the inside of alveoli and is essential for life due to its key role in preventing alveolar collapse at low lung volumes.[23][24] In the absence of surfactant, the surface tension at the gas/fluid interface prevents inhalation at standard pressure, but surfactant minimizes surface tension to values near zero and allows for normal breathing.[25] It is also known to have a role in both the immune response and inflammation control.\n\nSurfactant deficiency is a common cause of respiratory disease. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a particularly well-known instance of surfactant deficiency because it has a high mortality rate among preterm babies, a variety of other conditions are related to surfactant levels and composition.[26]\n\nSurfactant is composed of primarily lipids (90% by weight), and proteins make up only the remaining 10%. The following two sections will address the lipid and protein components respectively.\n\nSurfactant lipids\n\nLipids are a broad category of mid-sized molecules that are hydrophobic or amphipathic. In surfactant, two subcategories of lipids are relevant: phospholipids and sterols. Sterols are represented by cholesterol, which has an important role in the overall structure and motion of the lipids as a whole, but is vastly outnumbered by the phospholipids in surfactant.\n\nDPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine), as mentioned above, is a lipid with very useful stabilizing and compacting attributes. SP-B works primarily with this lipid, and moves it to the gas/fluid interface where it minimized surface tension.[27] Essentially, DPPC is so important for lung function because it can shrink or expand to fit the space necessary, and a continually shrinking and expanding lung requires components like this.\n\nOther lipids found commonly in surfactant include phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS).\n\nSurfactant proteins\n\nSP-B is one of four proteins commonly found in surfactant, the other three being surfactant protein A (SP-A), surfactant protein C (SP-C), and surfactant protein D (SP-D).[28] These four are highly interconnected in their functions in surfactant. For example, though the mechanism is not yet understood, SP-B functions in the post-translational modification of SP-C, and mature SP-C is not formed without SP-B.[29]\n\nSP-C assists in the functions of SP-B, and is most similar to SP-B of the three other surfactant proteins. It is smaller, only 35 amino acids long, and is found embedded in lipid structures much like SP-B.[30]\n\nSP-A and SP-D, known together as collectins, are more distinct from SP-B than SP-C. They are hydrophilic, so they are found in the solution, and function in immune response instead of lipid arrangement and surface tension reduction.[31][32] SP-A is actually a name for two very similar proteins, SP-A1 and SP-A2.\n\nAlong with SP-A, B, C, and D, blood plasma proteins are found in very small quantities in surfactant as well.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n",

    "passage": "World ORT\n\n[] [ORT students at a digital skills academy in Bulgaria, summer 2019] ORT (, _Obchestvo Remeslenogo (pronounced: Remeslenava) Truda_, “Association for the Promotion of Skilled Trades”) is a global education network driven by Jewish values. It promotes education and training in communities worldwide.[1] Its activities throughout its history have spanned more than 100 countries and five continents.[2] It was founded in 1880 in Saint Petersburg to provide professional and vocational training for young Jews.[3]\n\n\nOverview\n\n[ORT in Strasbourg, France] World ORT is a federation of autonomous ORT national organisations. In 2005 ORT's global budget exceeded US$250 million annually.[4] As of 2016, its annual budget was US$62.7 million.[5] ORT's current operations are in Israel, the former Soviet Union (including the Baltic States), Europe, Latin America, and South Africa.[6] ORT also runs International Cooperation programs and supports non-sectarian economic and social development in underdeveloped parts of the world, with vocational training and the provision of technical assistance.\n\nIn 2003 Israel was the area of ORT's largest operation, with 90,000 students educated or trained at ORT’s 159 schools, colleges and institutions, educating 25% of Israel’s hi-tech workforce.[7] However in 2006 ORT Israel withdrew from World ORT.[8] World ORT continues to work in Israel under the name of _Kadima Mada-Educating for Life_, working with the Israeli Ministry of Education, other Israeli ministries, regional councils and hospitals providing increased resources and improved facilities and schools equipment. World ORT raises funds through its membership organisations in different countries and through the Jewish Federations of North America'' (JFNA).\n\nWorld ORT is legally constituted in Switzerland, but operates from offices in London, England. It has consultative status for information and education purposes with UNESCO, and observer status at the International Labour Organization[9]\n\nORT is a founding member of ICVA (International Council of Voluntary Agencies).\n\n\nHistory\n\n[ORT in Argentina] The second partition of Poland in 1793 had resulted in a sharp increase in the number of Jews in Russia, so that in 1794 Empress Catherine the Great decreed that the majority of them would henceforth be restricted to living and working in the Pale of Settlement. The Jews were not allowed to leave the Pale or own land outside it. They were removed from their homes and villages and once resettled, barred from all but a handful of professions. The crowded conditions and legal barriers to self-sufficiency led to deepening poverty for the Pale's four million inhabitants. After the reforms of Tsar Alexander II in the 1860s, the situation improved for some Jews but those in the Pale remained trapped by economic hardship and dismal conditions. In 1880, Samuel Polyakov, Horace de Gunzburg and Nikolai Bakst petitioned Tsar Alexander II for permission to start an assistance fund which would improve the lives of the millions of Russian Jews then living in poverty. The fund would provide education and training in practical occupations like handicrafts and agricultural skills and would help people to help themselves.\n\nPermission was granted and the appeal was sent out, signed by Poliakov and de Gunzburg as well as Abram Zak, Leon Rosenthal and Meer Fridland, leading to the establishment of the Society for Trades and Agricultural Labor among the Jews in Russia. In its first 25 years, ORT raised educational standards and provided training to 25,000 Jews across the Russian Empire. People trained as artisans in glass-blowing, learned sewing and gardening, trained as mechanics, cabinetmakers, and furniture designers [10]\n\nThe first programs created by ORT were dictated by the demands of the market. In 1909, the industrialization in Russia created a need for artisans, so ORT developed courses for electricians in Vilna where electric streetcars were being introduced. They offered automotive courses in St. Petersburg when the automobile began taking root there in 1910. ORT’s training programs varied to meet the needs of Jews depending on where they lived and what the gaps in the workforce were. That flexibility and diversity meant that ORT became an established educational leader in many fields within only its first few decades of existence.\n\nAfter World War I, ORT opened agricultural schools to provide tools and training for agricultural enterprises. ORT headquarters moved to Berlin in 1921, after the Bolshevik Revolution. Initially, the Berlin office dealt mainly with fundraising and support for Jewish education in other countries where the Jews were less well-off. When the Nazis rose to power in 1933, Jewish children were expelled from German schools. ORT sought to open a school in Berlin but encountered difficulties due to the ban on selling property to Jews. Using its international ties, the British branch of ORT purchased a school building and dormitory in the Moabit quarter of Berlin. It received authorization to open in April 1937 after promising that all graduates would leave the country upon graduation.[11]\n\nLater ORT headquarters moved to France and finally to Geneva. Local groups such as American ORT and Women's American ORT, ORT Canada and British ORT were formed to support the growing network of programs. In 1938, Stalinist purges forced the closure of ORT programs in the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring World War II, ORT continued to serve Jewish communities, including those under Nazi occupation. In the Warsaw Ghetto, the German authorities gave ORT permission to open vocational training courses. Those courses continued throughout the war and until the liquidation of the Ghetto. They served as a template for similar ORT programs in other Jewish centers like Łódź and Kaunas.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, ORT established rehabilitation programs for the survivors. The first one in Germany was started in August 1945 in the Landsberg DP camp.[12] Vocational training centers were set up in 78 DP (Displaced Persons) Camps in Germany, and nearly 85,000 people acquired professions and the tools they would need to rebuild their lives. Jacob Olejski, a Dachau survivor who had previously organized ORT in Lithuania, was the driving force behind ORT's revival in Germany.[13][14] After 1948 he organized ORT in the newly founded state of Israel. [ORT in Jaffa, 1947] ORT operations in Israel started in Jaffa and Jerusalem, and although the Iron Curtain forced the closure of ORT’s activities in Eastern Europe, in the 1950s Ort activity increased in Western Europe, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran and India.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, ORT continued to provide education and relief services to Jewish communities in Israel, Africa and Asia while opening new programs to serve the Latin American Jewish communities in Argentina (ORT Argentina), Brazil and Uruguay (ORT Uruguay). In the early 1990s ORT returned to the former Soviet Union and the Baltic States, where it now serves 27,000 students in 58 schools and educational institutions every year.\n\nIn 2000, World ORT celebrated its 120th anniversary. The educational services provided through their network continues and has now been supplemented by programs intended to deliver basic nutrition, clothing, books and school supplies, counseling and other services designed to meet the growing emotional needs of students as well [15]\n\n\nCurrent and ongoing programs\n\nIn addition to technical and financial support for its network of schools and programs in more than 30 countries around the world, ORT has in the past run campaigns including:\n\n-   THE LATIN AMERICA CAMPAIGN: In 2006-7, ORT began a major program of new projects intended to create a sense of unity and connection throughout the region, meeting the highly individual and specific needs of each community. This campaign was active in small Jewish communities as well as larger ones. For example, the two ORT Argentina high schools in Buenos Aires are overcrowded and a new high school is planned to accommodate the students there. At the same time, the Jewish community in Montevideo (where ORT operates a university), is getting much needed scholarship funds.\n-   WORLD ORT KADIMA MADA IN ISRAEL: Kadima Mada is World ORT's arm in Israel and has run since 2007, delivering electronic, science and computer labs as well as technology education to students in schools throughout Israel, most of which are in northern Israel, and in the south of the country close to the border with Gaza. New computer labs and whiteboard technology provide a new opportunity for students. The program works with local authorities, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, and marks a new phase in ORT’s commitment to bring the best practical education available to the Jewish State.\n-   REGENERATION CIS: This program aimed to bring quality Judaic and general high school education to Jewish communities throughout the independent sovereign states of the region that was formerly the Soviet Union. In order to complete its mission for the renewed program, ORT ensures that equipment and services in existing centers are maintained and fully operational, to upgrade systems to enable them to deliver enhanced options, to provide school-wide training to ensure that all staff is able to deliver the new materials, and to provide ongoing staffing and resources. In the new centers, ORT carries out necessary refurbishments, plans and installs new systems and services, trains staff, and provides ongoing staffing and support.\n\n\nLocations\n\n-   NORTH AMERICA: ORT America and ORT Canada fundraise for World ORT programs around the globe.\n-   LATIN AMERICA: Locations of ORT programs in Latin America include: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay.[16]\n-   ASIA: ORT ran programs in India and has an affiliate school in Singapore [17].\n-   AFRICA: A global aid program previously ran in a number of African countries. The center of operations is currently South Africa [18] with occasional courses in countries including Burkina Faso.\n-   EUROPE: Schools, courses and fundraising run and take place in countries including: France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Belarus.\n-   ISRAEL: The Kadima Mada school network runs in Israel along with extra-curricular and vocational training.[19]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \"World ORT Consolidated Report and Financial Statements, Year Ended 31 December 2016.

    "passage": "History of Kaohsiung\n\n[The port of Ta-kau, 1893]\n\nThe written HISTORY OF KAOHSIUNG can be traced back to the early 17th century, though archeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the Makatau clan of the Siraya aboriginal tribe, who settled on what they named _Ta-kau Isle_ (translated to 打狗嶼 by Ming Chinese explorers); “Takau” meaning “bamboo forest” in the aboriginal language. Dutch settlers colonizing Taiwan in 1624 referred to the region as _Tankoya_ and named the harbor _Tancoia_. The first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by Chen Di, a member of Ming admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and Penghu of pirates. In his report on the “Eastern Barbarian Lands” (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:\n\nVarious later historical documents of both the Ming and Qing Dynasties referred to Kaohsiung as either “TA-KAU” (打狗) or “TA-KU” (打鼓). The modern name of 高雄 (pronounced “Takao” in Japanese and “Kaohsiung” in Mandarin) was not adopted until the Japanese colonial period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\nEarly history\n\n[Archeological sites near Kaohsiung.]\n\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4700–5200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding Kaohsiung Harbor, and include artifacts found at 壽山遺址, Longquan Temple ruins, 桃子園遺址、左營舊城遺址、左營遺址、後勁遺址、覆鼎金遺址、Fengbitou. The prehistoric Dapenkeng, 牛稠子, Dahu, and Niasong civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal Makatau civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as hunter-gatherer societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present.\n\nSigns of more recent Han Chinese settlement have been found near the old city of Tsoying, and is one of the largest finds of recent Han Chinese cultural artifacts to date. Artifacts discovered have included various types of ceramics and pottery believed to be of Chinese origin dating to the early Qing Dynasty, about 400 years ago.\n\nFengbitou ruins (2000–6000 years ago)\n\nThe Fengbitou civilization is representative of Neolithic civilizations found in the Taiwan area and shows significant influences from mainland cultures. The civilization is believed to have persisted for a very long period (2000–6000 years ago), with archeological digs finding artifacts buried in multiple layers. Remains have been found throughout the southern and central portions of Taiwan's western seaboard, with the ruins found at Fengbitou near Linyuan District representative of the civilization in general. Fengbitou was originally submerged, with the modern coastline formed by falling sea levels and the accretion of a river delta. The ruins were discovered during the Japanese colonial period, along with those of other civilizations, and is one of the most important archeological sites in Taiwan.\n\nThe site has three major layers:\n\n1.  Dapenkeng culture, marked by the appearance of characteristic pottery containing fine grains of sand, existed from 4700–5200 years ago.\n2.  Niuchouzi (牛裯子) culture: 以繩紋紅陶為主，並有部份夾砂紅、灰陶和泥質紅陶，其年代距今約3500年前。由出土文物中可以推測是一個此一文化層為農、漁、獵並重的生活型態。\n3.  Fengbitou culture: 以出現貝塚和紅褐素面夾砂陶為主要特色。其年代大致在3500～2000年前。生業型態表現出對農業依賴，聚落型態和前期大致一樣，但從大量增加的陶器，可判定人口密度增加。\n\nTaochiyuan ruins (3000–4500 years ago)\n\nTaochiyuan (桃子園) shell mound is located in the northwestern part of the North Chaishan (北柴山). It is one of the earliest ruins discovered in Kaohsiung. Pottery, stone tools, and evidents of human burials were found in the region. This society belongs to the 牛稠子文化層, and later the 大湖文化層. Its economy was based on agriculture, fishery, and hunting.[1]\n\nTsoying Old City ruins (400–1300 years ago)\n\nLongquan Temple ruins (400–2000 years ago)\n\nMakatau Clan period (prior to 1624)\n\nPirate records\n\nLin Daoqian\n\nOne of the most famous folk characters of the pre-Dutch Takau region was the pirate Vintoquián (林道乾, Lin Daoqian) (林道乾), reputed to have been active in robbing ships of their treasure during the reign of the Ming Jiajing Emperor (1522–1566). Folklore holds that while anchored at Takau in 1563, Lin placed his treasure into eighteen and a half bamboo baskets, hiding them in the surrounding hills. During this time, Lin was told by a feng shui master named Wu Ban-hsien (吳半仙) that if he were to bury his deceased father in a “dragon cave” near modern-day Jiali, leave an offering of an arrow upon the altar , and sleep while holding one hundred grains of white rice in his mouth for one hundred days, before firing three arrows towards the imperial capital in the northwest on the dawn of the last day, he would be able to conquer all the lands under heaven. Shortly after hearing this, Lin discovered a “divine rooster” while hunting in the hills, whose call could be heard for over 300 _li_ and would cause all other roosters to call at the same time. Upon capturing the divine rooster, Lin handed it to his sister Jin-lien (金蓮) to care for, while he prepared to fire the arrows towards the imperial capital at the crack of dawn on the one hundredth day.\n\nOn the final night, Jin-lien was unable to sleep, sitting awake under a lamp with the divine rooster. At the hour of midnight, Jin-lien touched the rooster to pet it, but inadvertently startled the rooster, causing it to call. Upon hearing the rooster calling, Lin awoke and mistakenly thought that dawn had arrived, immediately firing off three divine arrows with his name towards the imperial capital in the northwest. Thinking he had succeeded, Lin went back to sleep dreaming that he had become emperor. The three arrows flew into the imperial palace, unerringly striking the dragon throne. However, as it was midnight, the throne was empty. The next morning, the emperor found the three arrows with Lin's name on them stuck in his throne. Realizing that Lin had attempted to kill him, the emperor became enraged and ordered his troops to arrest Lin.\n\nWith imperial troops closing in, Lin attempted to flee, but was delayed by his sister who refused to leave without their eighteen and a half baskets of treasure. In a fit of panic, Lin killed his own sister before fighting his way out of the sieging forces. In the process, Lin struck the side of the valley between Takou Mountain and Chi-hou Mountain, breaking a hole through which seawater poured in. Lin and his men escaped by sea from this hole, according to legend.\n\nWokou\n\nDuring the Ming Dynasty, the seas surrounding Taiwan were lawless waters, infested by pirates. The imperial court launched three separate naval campaigns against Wokou pirates operating in the waters surrounding Taiwan (in 1574, 1603, and 1617). It was during the 1603 campaign that Chen Di penned the first records referring to a Takou Isle in his book “Eastern Barbarian Lands” (東蕃記), which also contained the first descriptions of the early residents of Taiwan.\n\n\nRecent settlement and development\n\nDutch colonial period (1624–1661)\n\nTaiwan became a Dutch colony in 1624, after the Dutch East Indies Company was ejected from Penghu by Ming forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named Takau TANKOYA, and the harbor TANCOIA. In 1726, the Dutch missionary François Valentijn (華倫泰因/潘連單) named Takau Mountain “Apen Berg” (猿山), a name which would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century.[2] During this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of Han Chinese to Taiwan began due to famine in Fujian, with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.\n\nKingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n\nQing Dynasty rule (1683–1895)\n\nKangxi period\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nLocal development\n\nTakau Harbor\n\nKi-au Region\n\nKi-au written in Chinese as 旗後 or 旗后 ()\n\nJapanese colonial period (1895–1945)\n\n[Takao Prefecture government office]\n\nEarly colonial period (1895–1919)\n\nTakao Prefecture (1920–1945)\n\nIn 1920, the eighth Governor-General of Taiwan Den Kenjiro modified the political divisions of Taiwan. He abolished the _chō_ (廳) system and instituted a prefecture system similar to that of mainland Japan. Takao Prefecture consisted of modern-day Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County.\n\nCity of Takao (1924)\n\nTakao was upgraded to a city in 1924.\n\nPostwar period (After 1945)\n\n[Kaohsiung City (1945–2010)] After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in October 1945, Kaohsiung City was established as a provincial city consisting of eleven districts. Around the same time, Kaohsiung County was established to be part of Taiwan Province on 6 December 1945. Kaohsiung City was upgraded from provincial city to special municipality on 1 July 1979.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Kaohsiung City was merged with Kaohsiung County to form a larger Kaohsiung special municipality. Prior to the merging, the population of Kaohsiung City was around 1.5 million people.[3]\n\nOn 31 July 2014, a series of gas explosions occurred in the Cianjhen and Lingya Districts at midnight after initial gas leaks were reported earlier that day at 8:46 p.m. local time.[4] The explosions left 31 dead and 309 injured.[5][6][7]\n\n\nPolitics\n\nUprisings during Dutch rule\n\nUprisings during Qing dynasty rule\n\nAnti-Japanese activity\n\nFebruary 28 incident (1947)\n\nKaohsiung Incident (1979)\n\nLocal factions in Kaohsiung County\n\n\nEconomy\n\nPottery\n\nSalt\n\nFisheries\n\nAgriculture\n\nSugar\n\nRice\n\nTobacco\n\nBananas\n\nBananas were originally imported from mainland China until the Japanese colonial period.

As a result, Kaohsiung was called a “cultural desert” in early times. However, the efforts of the Kaohsiung government and artistic organizations turned the region into a center of Chinese culture beginning in the 1980s. An art museum has been established, as well as a science and technology exhibit and other large-scale exhibitions.\n\nLiterature\n\nArt\n\nMusic\n\nCrafts\n\nPaper umbrellas\n\n籮筐會\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n",

    "passage": "[FN] Shadows of the ashes\n\nFirst Story Give me hell guys =)\n\nFOREWORD This short story is set in a world similar to ours during the late medieval or early renaissance period. I am not a scholar of history but I try my best to mimic the feel of the period. In the world of the Fighting Fiefs they are several major powers.\n\nThe Three Kingdoms- Led by a council of three kings who vote on any issue that arises they are the second largest military power on the planet. They lead the rest of the world in science and the design of their capital, Santuario, is the largest trading hub in the known world. They worship a tree god who they believe watch over their pastures. They are based on the Italian free states or the old Spanish Monarchy.\n\nFramani- Led by King Alexander the kingdom is the largest on the planet. They have recently began sending scouts into old Imperium territory to reclaim land lost in the collapse. Their capital Stolzes is a city famous for its large temple in the center. They follow the pantheon of the old Imperium They are based on France and Germany. The main characters of our story hail from Framani.\n\nAvalon- The savage pirates of Avalon are famed for their fleet that has never lost a battle. The people of Avalon are rough and speak in a brutish tongue. They were never a territory of the old Imperium and as such lack the sophistication of the late age advances in culture and in science. They worship the harsh gods of the ice and snow. They are based on Norse occupied Scotland and Ireland.\n\nThe Old Imperium- Once were the greatest might on the planet. The great collapse led to three centuries of chaos in the realm that eventually led to the current age. They ruled most of the known world for over 800 years. All that remains of the old Imperium are their former territories and their extensive aqueduct and road systems. They were based on the Ancient Greeks or Romans.\n\nThe Waste- A large area covered in sand and ashes due to the great collapse. No life can be sustained in this area due to the heavy amount of soot in the air. Recent efforts by Framani to re colonize these lands are underway but progress is slow. This is the setting for our tale.\n\nChapter 1\n\nThey had been traveling for three days and Cesar could feel the slow burn of his feet cramping as they walked through the wastes. “Perhaps we should turn back” he asked. “Don’t be a fool we have ten more miles to scout before morning” replied Jean. Jean was the leader of the group of scouts that were sent to wander into the grey waste and find a place for settlers as part of the King’s new recolonization plan. Cesar was not fond of Jean, in truth no one was fond of Jean, he was a decorated military officer that claimed his fame from the sack of Norgdium during the raid against the Avalonian pirates. He was famed among the women in the nobility because of his bright blond hair and dark blue eyes.\n\n“Why Cesar you scared of the spirits in the ashes?” laughed Dorian as he waddled through the sand. “Fuck off Dorian.” replied Cesar. Dorian, in Cesar’s mind, was quite simply a dick. He had shoulder length black hair and a small goatee that made him look as though he was calm and casual. Though Dorian came from nobility he was disowned for a scandal with his family. No one knew what the exact details were but rumors were circling that it involved a suitor meant for his sister that was found in his bed.\n\n“Fine we’ll stop here” said Jean “We have to wait for that failure Pierre to catch up anyways. Cesar looked behind him and saw a large shape waddle through the dense smoke and slowly come into view. Pierre was a fat, old soldier he had thin brown hair that had specks of grey in it and a long beard that was mostly grey. Pierre was running as fast as his short fat legs could take him. “My lord my, my lord!” Pierre panted trying to catch his breath. “What is it” spat Jean”Well spit it out gros cul” Dorian laughed at Pierre trying to catch his breath “The fat bastard looks as though he has seen a ghost”. “My lord the ashes…they moved.” “Well no shit” replied Jean “they are falling from the fucking sky!”\n\n“No my lord the ashes on the ground they moved”\n\nDon’t be ridiculous Pierre everything here is dead and has been for 300 years.” “But you do know what they say of this waste my lord?”\n\n“The ghosts in the ashes I know it is no more than superstition from the settlers to scared to move at the kings command.”\n\n“But”\n\n“Quiet Pierre or I will have Dorian rip your tongue out”\n\n“And I will gladly comply” Dorian jested.\n\n“We will set up camp here tonight.” “Cesar and Dorian set up the tents, Pierre get a fire ready, you can do that can’t you?”\n\n“Yes my lord” said Pierre though he was not quite sure of himself.\n\nChapter 2\n\n“What do you mean it’s gone?” asked Jean angrily. “The water sir it’s been turned to this.” Said Pierre with a look of terror on his face. Pierre tipped the canteen and a thick black sludge oozed out of the opening. “You know what this is don’t you sir?” inquired Dorian. “Yes I do, its ash water, but we are not far in the wastes enough for this to be happening.” Cesar remembered the stories of the wastes of the children who would go in and never return of the souls of the old Imperium warlocks who would cast their dark spells on any one who dared enter their territory.\n\n“It’s the ghosts my lord I’m telling you, no, I’m begging you please let us go back. “I will have no more of these talks we will go forward.” Said Jean with a blank stare on his face. Suddenly Cesar saw an arrowhead come out the back of Jean’s skull. “Holy shit!” screamed Cesar as he ducked for cover. “I don’t want to die!” screamed Pierre “I’m sorry”. Dorian already had drawn his sword and shield and was circling trying to deflect the arrows which were no longer being shot. Cesar looked over at the body of Jean the arrow had gone through his left eye and out the back, blood was beginning to pool near the wound. “Shouldn’t we help him?” asked Pierre “No use” said Dorian “he’s dead”.\n\n“We should bury him” said Cesar\n\n“No need, the ashes will cover him by morning”\n\n“He deserves a burial or at least a cremation.”\n\n“He was a dick and a terrible commander.”\n\n“But he was still our commander and a fellow soldier.”\n\n“Look if you want to bury the connard go right ahead I’m going to go fortify our surroundings.”\n\nCesar pulled out a small shovel and began digging a hole to put the body in. “Um…Cesar can I talk to you for a moment?” asked Pierre almost as if he was scared of Cesar. “Of course my friend” replied Cesar as he continued to dig the hole “What did you need”?\n\n“It was the ghosts I’m almost certain” “It’s just a story”\n\n“No it’s not”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I saw them. While I was lagging behind you guys in the first day I saw it. It looked at me its skin was as grey as the ashes around it. It looked into my very soul with its large dark eyes. When it noticed I had seen it, it stared at me for a half a second and disappeared into the ashes around it. The Image is still in my mind Cesar” “And you think it killed Jean?”\n\n“I know it did”\n\nChapter 3\n\nIt had been two days since Jean was killed and everyone in the camp was hungry and thirsty. They had tried to return the way they came but the wastes always looked the same. “Did you see that!” yelled Dorian. “See what!?” said Pierre.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Don’t do that Dorian. Do you think this is a goddamn game? Our commander is dead killed by something we can’t even fucking see!”\n\n“It was his own damn fault he was killed. He should have turned us back the moment the horses had died but it was his own arrogance that led us further into the wastes than we should’ve been.” Dorian immediately regretted his words and realized what he had said.\n\n“He did what?” Cesar said with rage filling inside of him.\n\n“He…he wanted to claim more land for the empire”.\n\n“And you knew? YOU FUCKING KNEW AND YOU SAID NOTHING TO HIM!?”\n\n“I have nothing to live for anyways I have no home to go back to and neither did he why should we care if you two died with us? Even if I wanted to turn him around he would’ve killed me and went anyways.”\n\n“YOU BASTARD!”\n\nCesar pulled his sword from his sheath and charged at Dorian. Dorian unsheathed his own sword and blocked the first blow. Cesar swung downwards hard but Dorian moved out of the way. The swipe managed to cut his shoulder deeply. “Cesar, don’t make me have to kill you” pleaded Dorian. Cesar showed no remorse as he cleaved into Dorian’s hand and severed it. Dorian screamed in pain and fell to his knees.\n\n“Why?” asked Cesar blankly with his sword’s point to Dorian’s throat.\n\n“He. Owed money to a lot of people. He tried to escape by volunteering for the task. It was never personal.” “Cesar. Let him live he knows what he’s done.” Said Pierre “let’s go”\n\nThey walked away from Dorian and left him to the wastes.\n\nChapter 4\n\n“I never told you about my home have I?” said Pierre\n\n“No you haven’t” replied Cesar.\n\n“It’s a nice little place in the country I own about five pigs and”\n\n“What did you mean by I’m sorry?” interrupted Cesar.\n\n“What?”\n\n“When Jean was killed you ran away. You said you were sorry.”\n\n“It was 45 or so years ago. My first battle just happened to be the day we broke the walls of Santuario.”\n\n“You were there during the siege?”\n\n“No not during the whole thing only during the sack. My father was the leader of my regiment and he personally took me with him to loot the district. I was terrified. We got to this one house in the western district, which was on fire at the time, and my father saw a woman running. He quickly went and grabbed her and threw her to the ground. He looked me in the eyes and commanded me to go to him. I did as my father commanded. When I got to him he said he was going to make me a man and told me to take the woman. I did.”\n\n“You...raped her?”\n\n“Yes” Pierre said and then began sobbing uncontrollably.” And when I was done my father slit her throat.” He broke down and curled into a ball. “I wanted to tell her I’m sorry before I died.”\n\nCesar felt a presence behind him he turned quickly. There in front of him stood a large shadow, it had grey skin that seemed to be made of the ashes and dark sunken black eyes, in it’s hand was a cruel spear made of stone and ash wood. “Stand back!” Cesar commanded the creature but it did not listen. It slowly moved closer to Cesar and pointed at Pierre. “Pierre?” Cesar said puzzled. The creature nodded. Cesar then realized that the creature was human. Its body covered in ashes and its eyes covered in a thick black sludge. Cesar held his hand out to the strange man and then saw behind the man more creep out of the ashes. There had to be at least fifty of the strange people. The man nodded behind him and motioned for Cesar to follow. “Pierre get up” said Cesar Pierre got up slowly his eyes red from crying and followed Cesar and the strange people.\n\nChapter 5\n\nThey approached the massive walls of the city by daybreak. They had been following the strange people for several days and were fed and given water by them. They spoke no common language but some words sounded vaguely familiar to worlds spoken in the old Imperium tongue. The gates to the city opened and they were received by a man on a horse. “Hail” he said in a hard to understand voice. “I am the king of the city” the rest of the words were unintelligible “Hello I am chevalier Cesar and his is my friend Pierre” The king of the city looked confused he motioned his men who gave them food and water. “Lev you r not welcome here” the king said. “But” Pierre said as he stepped forward. A man drove a spear through his neck. Cesar looked on in horror as he saw Pierre fall to the ground. “Leave” the king said in a harsh voice. Cesar turned and walked back into the wastes as the city vanished into the ashes.\n",

    "passage": "Happy Ending\n\nEvelyn was tired.\n\nBeneath her lay a young boy, he must have been no more than eighteen years old given his angry, naked spot-pocked back that resembled a butchers chucked cartilage. He had an erection that threatened. \n\nThe room was a precoital picture with heavy cardboard sweat socks discarded in the corner. Wet jeans and a t shirt told Evelyn that outside the sideways rain hadn’t eased up and in turn she told herself that this was the last customer. Her feet were sore and her head was turning into a train station.\n\n‘Are you comfortable?’ she asked the boy.\n\n‘Yeah,’ he said, ‘you could maybe go a bit harder?’\n\nIt was the usual script from this type of client. They were never money men, someone as mid-level as Evelyn only attracted a certain type of client and they were never money men. But they were always men.\n\nShe liked to call this type of client a ‘suggester’. Too scared to outright ask for what they wanted, or needed. But being good at her job, she could always see through their nervous eyes and veiled suggestions. Evelyn always delivered.\n\n‘Yes, sir.’ she said\n\nHe giggled.\n\nThe greatest violation that she could imagine was a laugh. Suggesters always giggled. She wanted to make this one quick as she was still sore from yesterday. The man from yesterday had left a bad feeling in the room and a bad feeling in her. She knew from the moment that he walked in the door that he was going to dump everything on her. All his anger in one quick but painful session, she called this type of client a ‘dump’. She was the dump.\n\n‘Should I just lie on my back, or…?’ the boy said, bringing Evelyn back to herself.\n\nShe had a habit of letting her mind wander, and when she came back everything was always worse. But most of all, as always, it was the smell. A smell that without fail would intensify as Evelyn ribbed her hands along a clients back. Kneading her knuckles among his boy-back, aggressive pores would open further and cough out his boy-smell, a smell that made her sick, without fail. \n\nHah-hah-hah he dumped us on you. Evelyn the dump!\nYesterdays man had definitely left his mark. It was inside her.\n\n‘Just as you are is fine’ Evelyn said, violated.\n\nShe began to work on him. Starting off slow she air brushed her hands along his skin to waken it up, to get the pores spilling. She knew what she was doing, time-sure hands followed their usual route up and down, taking care not to neglect any inch of skin or finite sized hair that might be raised. The boy was beginning to warm up and tried to match her rhythm. \n\nViolated.\n\n‘Yeah, that’s good’ he said. ‘Could you go a little harder?’\n\nEvelyn sighed and collected herself, this was her job and she was good at her job. \n\nShe closed her eyes and sucked in air through her mouth, having been trained never to breathe in through the nose, especially when a rankey suggester was in the room. \n\nThings slowed down as she removed herself from the present, it was easier that way. To let go. The air become a little more bitter as she prepared herself.\n\nThere’s nothing in him. You’re full, Dump. You’ve got us.\n\nThe floor started to mould around her as if made of porridge while the room gently turned and made her a little light-headed. This is how it was.\n\nEvelyn the Dump! Evelyn the Dump! I think she likes him!\n\nShe could see herself from above moving to dim the lights and play her industries music. She did it slowly, assuredly. She was good at her job. With the lights dimmed, a neon sign that read: “Marie’s Massage Parlour: Leave Your Worries Behind” emptied its heartless light onto the room.\n\nThis is how it always was. The neon sign that denoted her trade stuttered twice and then blinked on and off before regaining control and teased with its arrogance. Of course the boy had no idea what was happening, he was fixated on the blood that was rushing around his already primed skin and mistook it as arousal. \n\nHe wouldn’t want a fatty like you. You’re fat. He hates you.\n\nFrom above she could see herself walking back towards the boy. She started on his neck, searching for knots and story lines. There were none, he had no stories. Determined to help she moved a little further down to his shoulders, some stress was found but not enough to justify a dumping. A little further down and marking along his spine she stopped, what was that? A trauma? \n\nMaybe it was here.\n\nOn her first day at Marie’s Massage Parlour Evelyn came in somewhat boldly, expecting salaries and summer holidays. She had long ago learned not to aim too high. Too many beat downs and too many corridor whispered, ‘there goes Evil-yn, evil Evil-yn, fat fat fatty Evil-yn,’ had made a woman like so many. She liked to stay quiet and out of shot of hooked female glances. She would become good at her job she said.\n\n‘Hi I’m Evelyn, I’m here for my first day,’ she had said to the woman behind the reception desk.  \n\nThe woman lazily picked her eyes off the computer screen and plumped them on Evelyn, immediately sensing her somewhat boldness and hating it.\n\nFat fat fatty\n\n‘I’m Ruth,’ she replied with lazy contempt. Ruth thought for a moment, twiddled her pen in her hair and bit her thin bottom lip. Too much competition, she thought, time to hurt. ‘You will need to get fitted for a uniform.’\n\n‘Yeah, I sent my measurements ahead, they said it should be ready?’ \n\nEvelyn was beginning to get nervous. She could feel Ruth peeling her apart with her eyes, she was judging, stripping, hurting.\n\n‘It should have been ready, yeah,’ said Ruth, gearing towards her sting. ‘But sometimes for girls of a...larger size it takes longer for them to come through.’ She pasted her eyes off Evelyn and returned to the screen, and briefly allowed herself to smile at the damage caused.\n\n[clarify] ‘Oh, OK, thanks. Should I just...’ She stopped herself from finishing, the damage had been caused. Her make up began to feel silly on her face, she could feel it heavy on her brow, mocking her with its weight and boldness. She was sweating.\n\nFat sweaty Evelyn.\n\nBack in the room with the boy, Evelyn was still working the muscle in his back. Trying to seek out his lumps and the temperature was rising. This was normal when the client was a suggester, he was becoming more and more aroused. But that was OK, that was to be expected, as long as nothing came of it.\n\n‘Does it hurt here?’ she said.\n\n‘Yeah, go lower, go lower please.’\n\nAlarm bells dusted off their clackers.\n\nEvelyn coughed slightly and slowed her movements, this usually was hint enough for most suggesters to behave.\n\nBehaving was something that Evelyn knew all about. \n\nDaddy’s gonna get you. [more - dump]\n\nThe boy took the hint. Maybe not on a conscious level, maybe he was starting to notice the blinkering sign. Leave your worries behind.\n\nThe man from yesterday was starting to push his memory to the front of Evelyn’s mind like sausage meat through a grinder. The sticky boy below her was beginning to sicken her, as it always did, and was reminding her of what was there to stay.\n\n‘Come on in’, she had said to the man from yesterday, ‘make yourself comfortable. If you would like to take your shirt off and lie on the table I’ll be in with you in a moment.’\n\nThe room changed as soon as he came in. His type was very familiar to her but there was something different about him. His poorly tied tie and loose top button put him immediately in sales, a targets man. Evelyn clocked that his tension would likely be in whatever arm he held a phone or knocked a door with. The ink on his left cuff told her what arm that would be.\n\n‘Thanks, I wont be long.’ said the man as his eyes shiftily kissed from her to the floor. ‘I’m Andy,’ he said as Evelyn made her way past him out the door. She didn’t miss his self-hating eyes grope her ass as she passed. \n\n‘Evelyn,’ she said and walked out.\n\nAlone in the room, Andy looked around. A long table sat in the middle of the room like an electric chair. It had been surgically tucked in with brilliant white towels except for a hole at the top of the table reserved for a clients head. Andy had a shiver as he thought of the things he wouldn’t be able to see happening when he would be in position. \n\n\n\n\nAndy lifted up his shirt and winced slightly as his left shoulder fought back. Shirt off, he saw his reflection in a mirror. The belly was a little hairier and wider than it should have been. She will be disgusted, he thought as he tried to manage his thinning hair into respect.\n\nFrom outside the door Evelyn was resting from one foot to the other, it was the end of the day and this man scared her. He was here to dump. She knew it. \n\nIt is known that a massage releases tensions that have been built up over time, physical tension from work or age. It is also known that emotional tensions affect the body and a trauma can work its way into your muscle. Pain inflicted on you sits on you like a vulture gruelling over sloppy seconds, Evelyn knew too well.\n\nWaiting outside the door she tried to imagine what Andy would do when he went home. Would he push keys into a door that had a stream of similar doors beside it on each side? She imagined that he he would throw his jacket onto the bench and work at his tie. Bean baked bowls would be resting on each other, because Andy was a slob and she knew it. She could picture his out of shape body sliding into a shower as he picked clumps of shirt wool out of his chest hair, scratching his ass and making toast: that was Andy.\n\nShe pictured him getting into a bed that was hardening from lonely nights, so many lonely nights. [clarify]\n\nHe would probably touch himself, she thought. I bet that beast touches himself, she thought. He would start off slowly, just like he would want her to. He would work himself into a frenzy, feeling his muscles tighten with all the youth they used to have. Andy would become the man he once was, arms and legs begging for strain. His back would arch itself painlessly as he maneuvered Evelyn onto her back and he would breathe his young man kisses onto her. \n\nFor that moment he would be beautiful again, Evelyn thought, as she stood resting from one foot to the other outside the door.\n\n‘I’m ready’, Andy spoke pityingly.\n\nWho would want you, Dump?\n\nThe boy was beginning to get restless, his plan wasn’t working so he decided to play harder. He tilted his hips to the right giving an opening.\n\nWho would want you, Dump?\n\nEvelyn, in her thoughts of yesterday almost mechanically edged towards the opening that this soft mass of boy beneath her presented. \n\nAgain seeing herself from above she could see her own willingness in this moment from the back of her knees, which were bending low to submit to him. She was still sore from yesterday. It was the type of pain that brought her back to being a young girl. The choking kind of pain that reminded her of her mother stuffing celery stalks into her mouth to force her period.\n\nFat sweaty Evelyn\n\n‘Vitamins, vitamins will bring it on, eat up, Evelyn’, her mother would spit. \n\nColic-like, a young Evelyn would be breathless from pain when it did come, hard and fast. Bent double she would ask it to stop, but mother would just scream, ‘vitamins’.\n\nEvelyn would be that young girl again when someone dumped their pain on her. \n\nFrom above she stopped herself from acting on the boy’s advances, from above she knew it wouldn’t make yesterday’s pain go away.\n\nYesterday, Andy had lay on the table when Evelyn asked him. She stood above him and said, ‘Today I am going to give you a deep massage’. Andy, the fool, thought his time had come.\n\n‘It might hurt, and if it does just you just tell me and I’ll stop, OK?’\n\n‘Yeah, sure,’ he said not quite sure.\n\n‘If you maybe think you are going to...’ Evelyn chose her words carefully, but deliberately, ‘cry, or get emotional at any time, let me know and I’ll stop, OK?’\n\nShe remembers that Andy had laughed when she told him. But they always cried, every one of them had something to cry about.\n\nBefore she started on him she caught a glimpse at a neon sign that read: ‘Leave your worries behind.’ \n\nSomewhere, she heard from herself to stop.\n\n‘Get up please. Please go now, please,’ she said to the young boy still on her table. ‘I need to stop now, please get out.’\n\nThings were starting to get dizzy again, she was becoming the young girl again, ‘eat your vitamins and you’ll bleed, come on now!’ The floor was starting to slip and the room was passing by in streaks of captured memory. The man from yesterday was pushing through, Andy was knocking on her door and wanted to talk.\n\nThe dump from yesterday was starting to show itself again and it was strong. She could see it through a crack in a bedroom door.\n\nThe young boy was shouting, she thinks she can hear him shouting:\n\n‘What the fuck do you mean get out? I’ve paid for another twenty minutes!’ the young boy was shouting. ‘Fuck you, slut. You fat bitch!’\n\nFat fat fatty\n\nShe remembers that Andy had laughed when she told him about crying. That when she put her hands on him, his memories had ran up her arms and ripped onto her mind, and they came slow. Slow like she knew he would like them to. Slow like when he was a young boy sitting on his bedroom floor and could hear daddy’s feet resting from one to the other. \n\nLike when he could hear his daddy say, ‘Nobody wants you, fat fat fatty. Nobody likes you. Who would want you?’ Evelyn could see that Andy’s father was a thin man, and that he was sweating. She could see a fan in the corner of the room that threw out gasps of light and this sweating man.\n\nShe could hear a wet leather built being undone and the slipping noise it made when Andy’s father took his trousers down.\n\nShe remembers other things and they were hitting her frame by frame. Andy had got up off her table and he was crying, but happy. When someone dumps that from themselves, the pain in their back seems to have gone.\n\n‘Thanks, Evelyn,’ Andy had said, ‘I feel great!’\n\n‘Get out, please go,’ Evelyn was now shouting at the young boy who had put his shirt back on and was swearing at her from the reception.\n\nIn reception, Ruth was twirling her pen in her hair and told the young boy that Evelyn was always a little crazy.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All the homes are log and, although quaint, always seem warm with a glow of candles in the window.\n\n0\n0\n--\nIn: ----\nBy:\n \n\n[]\nForum\nTopics\nReplies\nLast Post Info\n❁\nFOXCREST\nAlthough Applewich has a port, most fish and sea products come from Foxcrest. It's a lively town, always busy, although not nearly as so as Applewich. The building structures have an alluring elegance to them, despite the fact that the town is also known for its many brothels. Some of the finer estates are seen in Foxcrest, and the people seem to have an affinity for gold. Many people enjoy visiting Foxcrest for many reasons, although those who call it home enjoy it even more.\n\n0\n0\n--\nIn: ----\nBy:\n❁\nPORT OF FOXCREST\nThe Port of Foxcrest is nearly as busy as the Port of Applewich, however it sees few personal ships and many fishing boats. The large, delicious fish sought after in kitchens comes from this port, and daily there are fish maids just as there are milk maids selling fish throughout. Some send servants from Applewich with all sorts of contraptions meant to keep the fish cool on the long travel back.\n\n0\n0\n--\nIn: ----\nBy:\n❁\nSOMERSET\nSomerset, the home of the elusive Lilies. Nearly as small as Green-Needle, the buildings of Somerset are bunched up by the sea. Although the people carry an elegance, their buildings lack the luster which their people contain. The town itself seems very simple, and quiet, with dated stone buildings. The nicer homes are hidden miles from the town for even more seclusion. Somerset is not known for much other than its mysterious natives, and few people visit as they find they're not often welcome.\n\n_SUBFORUMS ⇢_ the sunflower mansion\n\nSUBFORUMS: The Sunflower Mansion\n1\n9\nAug 19 2014, 05:14 AM\nIn: []Madness, Mirth and Mischief\nBy: SOLANGE CALANTHE\n \n\nBoard Statistics\n\n1 user(s) active in the past 15 minutes\n♙\n1 guests, 0 members, 0 anonymous members Show detailed by: Last Click, Member Name\nToday's Birthdays\n♙\n No members are celebrating a birthday today\nBoard Statistics\n█▄▊\nOur members have made a total of 781 posts\nWe have 27 registered members\nThe newest member is ATHALIA SELWYN\nMost users ever online was 16 on NOV 7 2014, 11:28 PM\nMembers Online Today: [Collapse]\n♙\nMost members ever online in one day was 14, last accomplished on AUGUST 31ST, 2014\nNo members have been online yet today\n\nwelcome\n\nThank you for visiting \"Lilies Among Daleford\", an _AU historical_ roleplay.

    "passage": "[NF] The Bungdeleon\n\nI was sitting inside of a small Mexican shop outside of a Mexican town called Ensenada. My English is far superior to my Spanish, which means I sit silent and hope the locals don’t spark up conversation.  Apparently the beans I was waiting for are the best around town so I had no choice but to wait it out. Also, I was too unfamiliar with my surroundings to go anywhere. \n\nAs I waited at the small rusted table the store clerk said, “You don’t talk man?” in his extremely heavy accent. I smiled, “No I can talk.” Without asking, the clerk poured a shot of something, I’ve leaned that if there is one common trait to relate men, it’s drinking together. I wasn’t going to deny what was poured in front of me, I raised my shot glass to cheers, and as I did a man who I somehow didn’t notice raised his shot off to the side. The clerk gestured that the shot was indeed from that man. I quickly found out my shot was Tequila. \n\nI thanked the mystery man sitting off to the side he was Mexican but spoke great English. He asked what I was doing in the shop as he motioned for me to take a seat with him. The clerk let me know my beans would be a little longer, all I could think about is why it takes so long for beans, but at this moment I had to put the beans behind me. I was going to sit with a mystery man who bought me a shot, he seemed much more intriguing anyway. \n\n“Hello, I’m Josh.”\n\n“I’m Victor. What are you doing here?”\n\n“Getting some beans for my family and I.”\n\n“You’re married?”\n\n“No, No, It’s for my mom and sister.”\n\n“Ah, you guys visiting?”\n\nI was a little hesitant to let Victor know what I was doing in the shop but it was a fair question. I wasn’t sure if it was the potency of the tequila or my attempt to fit in but I decided to fill in Victor how I arrived at this point. He seemed genuinely interested, his eyes were very relaxed and his voice very calm. Victor was a steady man and that made me oddly comfortable in my surroundings. The store clerk brought us another shot. It was set in front of me and I started to tell Victor why I was sitting where I was.\n\nI picked up my mom first and then my sister from LAX, we immediately made our drive to Mexico. It’s peculiar because we all seem to live such fast paced lives so for all of us to get away together was something great. I was initially excited, I was excited to leave simple electronics behind and deal with my thoughts rather than the constant movement of a busy town. I was hoping to spend some quality family time that wasn’t on a holiday.\n\nMy mother never needs an excuse to see her kids, that’s what she was telling us as we crossed the United States border and headed into a different country. As we drove I noticed the similarities of Mexico to the United States and at the same time noticed the major differences. A few corner shops, a few men armed with guns, it reminded me of parts of Los Angeles…a few more guns though. \n\nWe drove for hours, stuck in traffic, worried about my car that was making a loud noise. I wondered what the hell would happen if the car broke down, not to mention I was low on gas. I was the man and was doing my best attempt to play the situation cool but my family is who they are and they know me all too well. Of course they could sense my uncertainty as we drove through a patch of road that consisted of 30 dead dogs lying off to the side.\n\nCloser and closer we came to our destination. The perfect spot that was referred to from a family friend was becoming a reality. We approached the secluded beach house, it was off the beaten path - “pure tranquility” we were told. \n\nAs we made ourselves at home the first question was regarding dinner and food. We recalled a few shops we saw a few miles back, and with the recollection I said I would do the honor of making the adventure to the store. Typically both my mom and sister would come with me but I could tell they were tired. They also had some Mother/Daughter issues to discuss that I wanted no part of. \n\nAfter settling into the house I told my family I would be back in a bit. I was instructed only to buy American bottled water, rice, beans, and some other “good stuff.” I let them know I would be back in an hour or so.\n\nTwo hours later I was sitting across from Victor about to take my third or forth shot, I always feel more comfortable talking to strangers, and this was no exception. We were bonding over tequila. My beans had apparently been ready for quite some time but my family could wait, I felt engaged with a foreigner and I relished this moment.  The idea of connecting with a human completely out of my comfort was more appealing than making dinner right now. \n\n“So, Victor, do you live around here?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Where do you live?”\n\n“I’m jumping around.”\n\n“Jumping around?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Are you from Mexico?”\n\n“Originally.”\n\n“But you don’t live here?”\n\n“Nope.”\n\nVictor was clearly a man who loved his alcohol and it was on full display. He eloquently consumed double my amount. \n\n“Do you have family?”\n\n“No.”\n\nThis is strange what kind of man has no family?\n\n“Kids, Wife, Mom, Dad?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Victor, I feel a little tipsy right now, I can’t tell if you are messing with me.”\n\n“I suggest you head home Josh.”\n\nFor the first time in the conversation I felt uncomfortable. Did he mean Los Angeles or my beach home? Uh oh. It hit me that I don’t know this guy at all, and my fear had sobered me up a little. I was kicking myself in my head for disclosing more information than I should to this stranger. I started to wonder why I trusted people as much as I do, more and more my paranoia was setting in.\n\n“Home, like Los Angeles?”\n\n“No, back with you family. Spend some time with them.”\n\n“Victor, I’m going to level with you. You’re kind of freaking me out a bit.”\n\n“Why are you talking to me?”\n\n“Why not? I needed some company, you were here, and you got me a shot, I’m sorry to intrude.”\n\n“No, no. Don’t be worried. I ask because you have other things to do. So why talk with me?”\n\nI didn’t know how to answer him. I didn’t want to tell him I wanted to fit in. In the store I felt like a local and wanted some sort of acceptance. \n\n“Well, I’m talking to you because you bought me a shot and I thought we were enjoying each other’s company.”\n\n“Great! We are.”\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\n“I’m great.”\n\nTypically when I’m this uncomfortable I make a joke, it’s my default calming mechanism.  This time was different, I couldn’t think of how to incorporate one. I still feel very awkward in this moment and I’m hoping for some miracle to happen, I was hoping my sister would walk through the door to get me. As I was struggling to incorporate an uncomfortable joke and be on my way Victor made things very clear.\n\n“All my family passed away 15 years ago, that’s why I have no family. I don’t live anywhere cause I like to travel—NOT A TRANSIENT though! I just like to meet new people.”\n\n“Great, good, okay me too.”\n\n“But one of us should go.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Attachments, we are attached to this conversation now. Take what you can from this and move on.”\n\n“Take what? I’m confused?”\n\n“Josh, I hate when people leave my life. Everyone hates when people leave their lives. But, it happens, it is normal, but people like me get attached. I sense you get attached too.”\n\n“Attached, how so?”\n\n“Because you’ve sat here and talked with a Bungdeleon for two hours when you should be home with you family. You’re on vacation”\n\n“Did you just say Bungdeleon?”\n\nHe ignored the question, Hmmm, maybe that was just his last name?\n\n“Trust me, holding onto to things and conversations for to long can only hurt you. You have to know when to get out.”\n\n“To get out? Of conversations?”\n\n“No, no, small attachments, the ones that won’t be their forever. You can take or leave some things, but you gotta know when to leave sometimes. Trust me, it will ruin your life.”\n\n“Or you can learn from attachments.”\n\n“Yes the smart one’s do.”\n\nVictor ushered his final shot into his mouth and stood up.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“Everyone has to pee.”\n\n“Oh. I thought you were leaving.”\n\nVictor walked towards the back of the shop, I was intent on asking him what a “Bungdeleon” was. I’m certain that’s what he said. As he was gone I couldn’t believe I was sitting with him for as long as I was. I just came for some beans, which had been sitting in the same place for hours now. I decided that when he got back I should be on my way.\n\nA few minutes had passed. I stood up and walked towards the bathroom, the door was open, and nobody was inside. I noticed a backdoor and stuck my head out looking for Victor. I couldn’t find him. I asked the clerk if he had seen Victor. After some poor Spanish the clerk understood what I was saying. He told me Victor went out the back, but he paid for my beans. I didn’t believe the clerk and thought he was joking, but it was no joke. I took the beans and walked outside.\n\nAs I walked to my car I looked around for Victor, I saw nothing. I didn’t believe this man had vanished but I wasn’t about to go looking for him. I made the decision to drive back to meet my mom and sister. But, before that I had to know something, I ran back to the store clerk.\n\n“Excuse me, Do you know what a Bungdeleon is?”\n\n“Um…”\n\n“Bungdeleon?”\n\n“Yeah, slang, slang.”\n\n“Slang? For what?”\n\n“Travel, it mean’s to travel, you are a wanderer.”\n\nI had never heard of that but it made sense. I accepted the meaning, thanked the man for the beans, and headed to the beach house.\n\nAs I walked in my mom was sound asleep, my sister was frantic as she always is about my whereabouts. I explained things took awhile but didn’t get into detail. We stored the beans for a later time and both went to get some rest. I was definitely a little drunk and knew I should sleep it off. I wish I hadn’t forgot to buy the bottled water.\n\nThe next day I hoped to see Victor. Didn’t happen. I knew I’d never see him again but I felt for him. He needed constant movement for whatever reason and that stayed very close to me. In the grand scheme of things I didn’t know Victor but there was no way he would have allowed me to leave first. I preferred that because I didn’t know how long I would have talked to him, I would have gotten more attached to the conversation. \n",

    "passage": "Live Along the Valley of Death [SP]\n\nMay 14th, 2011 (No Regrets); “People ask, they ask things, questions of course. Questions that may or may not be answered. Some don’t even make sense at first, but they are all asked for a reason. People ask them because they wonder. They think, they dream, because these are the people who enjoy the little things. These are the people who love, and believe in a leader. They don’t take advantage of the life they are given and they spend the time they are given wisely. I would rather spend my life I was given being adventurous then to wake up to black and grey every morning. I would rather live a short exciting life than a long dull one. That’s not to say I don’t frown, because I cry, I shame, and I fall, but I don’t look down. Looking down is giving into pain, when I could rather smile through hell and drop off the weakness on my way.  ” –Johnny Sofer.\nJune 11th 2012 (Introduction); well, this is a story, kind of… It’s about someone who stood out to me, well; stood out to anyone he was in quarters with. There’s not to many ways to start this, but I had a friend, Johnny, Johnny Sofer. John wasn’t exactly like anyone else, and that’s not to say he wasn’t normal, because there is really only question on the accuracy of normal, right? John was a fourteen year old cancer patient at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, also known as ‘C.H.O.P.’. Fortunately he still got to carry on with school just as any other kid did.  He fit in with appearance quite impressively: brown hair, green eyes, about five and a half feet tall, but as white as a fresh cloud on a summer day. The things that put John at differences with others were his disabilities. He had a rare jaw dysfunction in which it affected his ability to talk, not too many people understood him, but still found a way to form a little dialogue so John could feel safer, you could say. He also possessed a rare bone disease when he was only five called ‘skeletal dysplasia.’ It strongly affected his ability to not only walk, but move in general. He managed, and carried on like all others, but even with his medication, pain was always in presence. He had a family for support, but there’s not too much support you can give. The thing was, John’s sickness wasn’t exactly temporary. In the fall of 2011 he was alerted that he had only a little over a year to live, but fortunately he wouldn’t suffer any more than he already has, as depressing as that sounds. His body just wouldn’t be able to keep surviving. So for the year on, he lived and loved his casual life as he wanted, but as friendly as John was, being casual wasn’t always enough to keep him happy. It was difficult for him to make friends, mainly because he couldn’t do what every other kid could, but I kept John from feeling lonely, I considered myself a companion, as he may have considered me euphoria. By the way, my names Finis. John and I have been friends since he was about five, right around when he was diagnosed with cancer, too young to really understand though. As time went by I kept him feeling loved and important, because he was. And that wasn’t really a coincidence of me meeting him, but rather a fortunate accident. \nJune 12th 2012 (Smile); John’s family was just like any other family from what I know. They tried their best to keep some weight off his shoulders, and keep me distant as much as possible. John surprisingly put more into keeping his parents calm than anything else, which was just uncommon and surprising. Watching someone deal with so much, and go through so much, but yet, help others up above him. It gets you to think, and even just appreciate things a little more.  Aside from all of John’s disabilities, this is why some considered him a gifted kid. He could basically pull the positive out of every negative. Well, anyone can, it just took the will power John had to prove people wrong, not show them that he could survive, but rather live and as he went on picking others up, he started to make it seem almost as though it was his job. He just had a secret, a stupid little one, but one that could make you ponder into belief. He claims that when you are mad, too smile and that as hard as it may seem, and as much as you may want to quit, smile in hope, for problems can be solved. He said as long as you’re smiling, you’re living.\nJune 15th 2012 (Departure); for some reason, I never felt the need to ask him why he was always in joy, because of course he had his little secret and all, but I wouldn’t be able to imagine what he’s going through. He seemed happy enough to keep others happy, so I guess it’s as simple as that. As close as we were, I’ve never met anyone like John, but everybody is born with a different personality and a different obscure view on life, but no matter what the personality or view on life is, there’s not a doubt that you can’t make the best of it. I realized that, on the night I found out John only had so much longer; it was almost as if he knew it was coming, as though he was warned.  John was a kid just like any other, besides his sickness. Except there was just one other thing, he thought a lot. He seemed to have his eyes closed constantly, yet he would not be sleeping. It puzzled me. As if he was almost dreaming, day dreaming, possibly about his situation. Maybe thinking about what might happen to him when it’s over, because humans do not have a clue about what happens. They just tell strange stories and old legends about what they assume might happen, but John looked beyond those stories and myths. John looked harder into it. He had a different theory on life and on death. I guess that was because he was so close to it, but what do I know? I have only known him since then.\nApril 5th 2011 (Baseball); John kept enjoying life. He still went to school and started to make more friends..  He always kept smiling more than he ever frowned, which was great. He actually played a sport for a bit. He played baseball. It wasn’t and still isn’t my favorite sport, but as long as it kept him busy, who was I to judge? Not to mention he was pretty damn good at it too. He played day and night and got better every minute. Everyone noticed him. It was still his first sport he ever played, but it kept him feeling like he fit in for once and he got quite a bit of playing time too. Not only did the coaches notice him, but he was actually approached by a nearby college baseball coach. To this day I don’t know if it was because of his situation or maybe out of pure kindness, but John was over joyed, matter of fact, he was honored.\nMay 15th, 2011 (Pursuit); Despite Johns muscle disorder, as stated, he played baseball. The thing I forgot to mention though is that wasn’t exactly in the doctors recommendations.  And there was no reason to get upset with John about it, besides, what would you do with a year to live? It caught up with him though. It was game day; Johns chance to shine for everyone. And of course it was his turn up to bat, cameras were rolling and people were cheering. The pitcher sent one down, and although people are still not sure if it was a slow pitch or John’s lucky day, he nearly a home run. It went all the way to back left field, I remember descriptively. John sprinted to first and went to head to second, he tripped. At least that was our first thought. Screams of terror came from John and he wasn’t moving after that. The trainer rushed over along with teammates, coaches, a few fans. John pushed himself to the max. Immediately after, he was rushed to the hospital. It turned out that his body went into instant shock and nearly all of his muscles tightened up to the point where it almost shattered his bones. He was instantly given some sleeping meds and remained asleep for a few following days to allow his body to relax. When he woke up he was lost, forgetful, and aimless. The team was notified, since they all came to visit when he awoke. He got the game ball; they won the game for him. John forgot about everything else at that time, the pain, the stress, and the time. He just seemed, relevant.\nMay 22nd 2011 (Worthwhile); John had to stay for the remainder of the month. Time went by, and John became even sicker. His symptoms became worse. The thing about that though, it had been one year and five months already. Silence was all that was really in play. Everyone’s mind was just an abyss, nothing to ponder and not much to say. That last month in the hospital was the longest month of John’s short, but meaningful life. I guess time really does go by fast. Before John passed, something clicked to me. I finally understood it. I understood why John was so happy all the time. Why he always smiled. He always had a good view on life and I always questioned it, but I never could figure out the answer. I started to look deeper. John lived his live knowing that it was almost over, he lived his life in joy knowing that it could end at any time. He didn’t have a gift. He just looked past everything and looked at the big picture in life. No matter whom he was or what he has been through, he never let it put him down. He smiled when he was upset, because smiling is the best therapy. Not only did John know he was dying, but besides the fact, he didn’t know when he was going to die. Everybody is dying. It is just a matter of time when it happens. Death is an amazing thing. It happens to basically everyone and everything. It can’t be reversed nor escaped. You can be scared of it, you can be ready for it, yet some might even rush it. Your life depends on death. How much time you have and how you use that time. The way you spend it, whether you abuse it or savor it. Whether you enjoyed it or despised it. Live like you death is coming. Live without fear and with an open mind filled with excitement and love. Expect the unexpected at all times and never let your head drop. Life is about giving, so give what you can and ask for nothing in return. Life is about doing not what you crave, but to help others achieve the same. Set goals. Don’t stop until you accomplish those goals, because at times those goals might be the only reason that’s carrying you on. Respect others and respect yourself. Never waste a day of your life. You are only given one life, so why even consider wasting it. Spend every second of every minute with even a hint of joy somewhere inside you. Don’t stop truly living till your heart stops beating, because someday it will be over, done, gone forever, make it worth it from the beginning. Let that courage represent those goodbyes.  Make people remember you in a positive way, as a well spent day bring happy sleep, so a life well spent brings a happy death. When you read this story I’m not saying I’m still alive at the end, I’m just telling a tail, and simply expressing my own tips for if someone else may come across them and consider being in need of them. So take this in mind. Save this story to your head. Remember these tips as for one day your time will come. As I told you in the beginning, my names Finis, I never said I was real, but I never said I wasn’t. People know me as different things, different beliefs, and different virtues, but that is only my appearance. As I am just another entity finding new problems to solve and riddles to conquer. As life is just a game to me and there is no winner. Just every role of the die is an adventure, but who really knows what or who I am. So that you can’t judge me by the clothes I am wearing, or the nametag I am given. Start asking the real questions, one that questions my human state of mind or even if I am a real thing. Whether you hate me or cherish me. Take it in. Absorb the truth. Because you all know, one day, just one split second, darkness will erupt, and your thoughts, hopes, and dreams will die. So make it last. Don’t ever rush it or wait for it. Don’t even question it, but remember my name as though you may meet me someday.  Whether you catch up to me in the afterlife, or I am brought to you by the experience of near death. Share my tails. Express my stories. Contain a mind of life, but live along the valley of death.\n",

    "passage": "[Feedback/Critique Appreciated, Still Rough] 2048\n\nHe sat there again, Saturday night.  Not at a bar, not out with friends at his desk.  The monitors he normally gamed on were black and on sleep mode, waiting to be jolted back to life by the movement of his mouse or a click on his keyboard, but gaming wasn’t what he planned to do.  Instead, he sat on his phone, playing 2048.  Occasionally, a bead of sweat would roll down his head, from the intense thinking going on inside his brain.  Sometimes, he wasn’t even thinking about the game, that was just something to keep his fingers moving.  He was curled up in a ball, knees up to his chest and hands resting on top of his kneecaps.  Both hands cupped around the iPhone, right thumb sliding left and right, up and down across the touchscreen, moving tiny squares with numbers on them.  Why was he doing this to himself? It was because it reminded him of her.\n\nNick had just gotten out of a year long relationship with his girlfriend, he was only 18, well, 19 now, but he had always thought about the long term, he wanted to be with her for the rest of his life if he could.  He loved her but he had trouble showing it sometimes, maybe that’s where he went wrong.  One thing was for sure though, Mary was the only girl he ever loved.  He had crushes, occasional swings with other girls, but he and Mary always clicked, she was so easy to talk to, her smile so vibrant, he couldn’t imagine her sad.  She insisted she would sometimes get depressed, like she claimed she was when she broke up with him.  \n** **\nHe was on the phone with her, telling her about a dream he had, it was really all unimportant now what the dream was about, but she listened and she began to speak, the words Nick had feared were coming for a while, but he had always been hopeful.\n\n“I.. I just.. don’t want a relationship right now.”  The words cut deep.  He knew that she had grown distant, but he didn’t realize how bad it was.  He had always been hopefully he could pull her back and make their life work together.  His brain was on autopilot, listening to what she had to say, not entirely believing it was completely over yet.  “I still love you.. I’m just going through some personal issues right now and I need to be alone.” Alone.  Right.. alone.  I don’t want to be alone.  He thought to himself.  He loved her though, more than anything, he could feel himself breaking down on the outside, already broken on the inside as she told him how she felt.  He told her that he was here for her, wanting to be as supportive as possible.  Even if this breakup wasn’t what he wanted, he loved her enough to let her go if that’s what she needed.  Nick said goodnight after a drawn out conversation with her and turned out the light by his bed, but he couldn’t sleep.  He went over every word he said, trying to find a deeper meaning.\n\nHe sat up and walked over to his computer, a couple of friends were on Skype, he didn’t want to talk to them though.  He got on his favorite game, and launched into a deathmatch.  He wandered around the map, shooting at pixels mindlessly, thinking about Mary.  He wished to hold her again, tell her he’d help her through all her tough times and depression that she felt.  But he couldn’t.  He wanted to cry, but he couldn’t bring himself to do that.  Not until the realization hit him that he had been dumped and she probably didn’t actually love him.  He turned off the game, went back to his bed and cried.  For the first time in what felt like forever, he cried.  He thought about all the scenarios and good times they had together, all the smiles.  The last month of their relationship had been especially torturous, with her acting on stage and preparing for a show, she couldn’t see him as much as normal, she had started growing away from him.  After a fight about whether he would be going to opening night or seeing friends, he decided to go to her show.  He did it for her.  He didn’t realize how much it meant during the fight, but once he realized just how much it meant, he did it.  He felt like shit for even starting that argument.  After all, he had always thought that they could make a life together and the last thing he wanted to do was hurt her.  The memory of the last time he saw her came to his mind and he thought about what he would’ve done differently as he lay in bed.\n** **\nHis 19th Birthday party.  It was a small family gathering, she barely spoke.  She sat next to him, but she barely spoke.  I should have tried to talk to her more.  After all the family members left and it was just her and his immediate family, he sat down on the couch next to her, awkwardly sliding his arm around her, trying to see if it would spark a reaction or get her talking, she just pulled out her phone.  He tried to talk to her, but it felt so artificial, she was an actress, and he couldn’t tell whether she was acting right now or not.  She asked if Nick had heard about this new game, 2048.  I shouldn’t have given her my phone, I should have forced a conversation.  He admitted he had not and she installed it onto his phone, a math game, you added tiles with the same number up, over and over, starting at 2 until you reached 2048, you could slide the tiles up right left or down in a 4x4 space.  It was a challenging yet fun game.  She played it once, then passed it to Nick.  They swapped back every once in a while, awkwardly playing a game and not talking all that much to each other.  When they did it just felt like small talk, like a couple on a first date.  They’d grown so apart.  It hurt him to think back to that night.  It was the worst Birthday of his life.  He walked her out to the porch, he didn’t have shoes on and it was raining, so he couldn’t walk her to her car.  She kissed him, a small one, just a goodbye kiss but as she turned he grabbed her, drug her in close and kissed her passionately.  If I had known it was the last time I’d kiss her, I would have held it longer.  Right before they made contact he heard a small “Oh” come out, as if she was taken by surprise.  Did she not realize how he felt?\n\n“Goodnight, I love you.” He tells her.\n\n“I love you too, goodnight.”  Flat.  She turned and walked away from him.\n\n“Drive safe.”  He watched her pull away and walked back into his house, mellowed.\n\nNothing after that.  Thinking back on it, he wished he’d walked her to her car, even if his socks got soaked, just to try and steal another kiss or two, or a small moment of contact that he just wished he could get now.  Another memory to hold of her.  He went back inside and played 2048 until he went to bed.  He was hardly getting a text from her now, it wasn’t until two days later that she broke up with him.  \n** **\nHe doesn’t know how to approach her anymore, after trying to figure out if there was any real reason besides her wanting to be alone for the breakup, he wasn’t going to get it.  He was just hurt and alone.  If it was her depression, he wondered why she wouldn’t use him, her boyfriend, as someone to confide in, someone to share her feelings with and someone to tell her it would all be okay.  Did she not trust him?  He couldn’t change how she felt, that was something he had to come to terms with.\n\nSo here he is, still sitting there alone on this Saturday night.  Trying desperately to beat 2048.  In some desperate way, he hopes that when he beats it he will be over her, find a way to move on.  But he can’t beat it.  He looks online, strategy guides on how to win, but they don’t help him.  He’s stuck playing, sliding, up.. left.. right.. but he can’t win.  She sends him texts, small, casual talk.  She calls him her “Best friend” and lingers the opportunity that one day they may be together again, but he doesn’t think that she loves him anymore.  He swears that he won’t check her Twitter, she tells him she’s depressed and wants to be alone, but she’s telling all her friends on Twitter, “Yes, I am single”.  It breaks his heart.  He turns off his monitors, let’s them fall asleep as he slides the number tiles, a text comes in from her, he will read it in a moment and continue to live in a fantasy world where they still have a chance together.  Then he’ll go back to playing 2048.  One day he’ll beat it, he’ll get over her.  But not tonight, tonight, he plays.\n",

Now in its fourth edition, the list highlights the 25 most impersonated brands in phishing attacks. The ranking is based on the number of unique phishing URLs Vade Secure detects for each brand within the quarter.\n\nFor the past three quarters, we published separate Phishers’ Favorites editions for North America and Europe. However, since we’re seeing minimal difference in the top 25 brands for each region, we decided to publish a single global list.\n\nWithout further ado, here is the full list, with additional analysis below.\n\n\nMICROSOFT REMAINS #1 AS HACKERS LURE TARGETS INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY\n\nPerhaps a surprise to no one at this point, Microsoft topped our Phishers’ Favorites list for the fourth straight quarter. After a big dip in activity over the holidays, when hackers shifted their sights to consumer targets, Microsoft phishing slowly recovered in January before resuming its torrid pace in February and March. In fact, the week of March 4th was the biggest single week for Microsoft phishing since we started our analysis. Because of the sluggish start to the year, though, the number of Microsoft phishing URLs actually declined in Q1 for the first time, finishing down a modest 4.5% from Q4 2018.\n\nMicrosoft’s sustained popularity with hackers stems from the lucrativeness of Office 365 credentials, which provide a single entry point to the entire Office 365 platform while enabling them to conduct multi-phased attacks using compromised accounts. In fact, Microsoft’s own research estimates that Office 365 phishing increased 250% from Jan – Dec 2018.\n\n[Phishers Favorites Q1 2019: Microsoft remains the most phished brand]\n\nWe continue to see a variety of Office 365 phishing attacks, from suspended account claims to links to phony OneDrive or SharePoint documents. Overall, the sophistication of these attacks is growing, with many Office 365 phishing pages being virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. To accomplish this, hackers mirror the actual Office 365 login page, pulling JavaScript and CSS directly from the legitimate website and inserting their own script to harvest credentials.\n\n[Microsoft Office 365 Phishing Page]\nMicrosoft phishing page with identical branding to legitimate website\n\nIn addition, we’re seeing pages that redirect users to legitimate Microsoft pages once they’ve submitted their credentials in an attempt to convince them that nothing is amiss. For instance, one recent attack targeting multiple customers would redirect users to Office.com after they “logged in”. What’s also noteworthy about this phishing email is that the reply-to was a legitimate Microsoft email: support@microsoft.com. Again, this is intended to create a false sense of security with the user.\n\n\nPAYPAL PHISHING SURGES, PROPELLING THE COMPANY TO THE #2 SPOT\n\nPerennial phishers’ favorite PayPal regained the #2 spot, driven by a significant 88% increase in phishing URLs in Q1 2019. PayPal held the #2 spot in Q2 and Q3 2018, before falling to #3 in Q4 2018 with a 5.1% decline in phishing URLs.\n\nPayPal has historically been one of the most targeted brands by phishers, and for obvious reasons: it is the most widely used online payment service worldwide, with more than 250 million active users as of Q3 2018. It’s also accepted by many online vendors worldwide, making PayPal credentials highly lucrative.\n\n\nNETFLIX PHISHING ATTACKS TARGET BOTH CONSUMER AND CORPORATE USERS\n\nNetflix fell one spot to #3 in the Q1 edition of Phishers’ Favorites. The growth in Netflix phishing URLs appear to be leveling off, from highs of 49.7% in Q2 2018 and 61.9% in Q3 2018, to 25.7% in Q4 2018 and 11.9% in Q1 2019.\n\n[Netflix Phishing Trend, Phishers Favorites, Q1 2019]\n\nIn terms of content, most Netflix phishing emails claim that the user’s account has been suspended and/or their payment declined. What’s interesting is that more and more Netflix phishing emails are targeted at corporate email users. Since most users most likely use their personal email addresses for their Netflix accounts, one can only assume that hackers are hoping users won’t notice that the email was sent to their corporate email address. This is certainly possible, particularly when users read email on their mobile devices.\n\nAnother interesting trend is that many Netflix phishing emails contain as many as six or seven legitimate Netflix links (in addition to one malicious link). This technique is aimed at fooling both reputation-based email filters and users, who check one or two links and then assume that the email is legitimate.\n\n\nROUNDING OUT THE TOP 10 of Phishers’ Favorites\n\nFacebook moved up three spots to #4, Bank of America dropped one spot to #5, and Credit Agricole shot up 15 spots to #6. Rounding out the top 10 were DHL at #7; Apple which increased eight spots to #8; Dropbox, which rose two spots to #9; and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) which shot up nine spots to #10.\n\nLike Netflix, Apple phishing is an interesting example that targets both consumer and corporate users. Moreover, thanks to the variety of Apple products and services, we continue to see a range of phishing subjects, including important security updates, disabled Apple ID, and Apple store receipts. We’re also seeing a combination of attack vectors, including phishing emails that also contain malicious attachments purporting to be an invoice.\n\n\nCLOUD CONTINUES TO REPRESENT THE MOST PHISHING URLS BUT SOCIAL MEDIA SAW THE LARGEST GROWTH\n\nAfter remaining consistent in Q4 2018, the industry makeup of the Phishers’ Favorites list changed in Q1 2019. Two financial services companies dropped out of the top 25, leaving seven brands in the category. Meanwhile, social media and government each added one company, bringing their respective totals to three and one. Cloud (6), Internet/Telco (5), and E-Commerce/Logistics (3) remained unchanged.\n\n[Industry Phishing Trend, Phishers' Favorites, Q1 2019]\n\nIn terms of percentage, cloud accounted for the most phishing URLs for the fourth straight quarter. 42% of all phishing URLs impersonate cloud providers, down from 49.6% in Q4. This decline was driven by the fact that four of six cloud brands in the top 25—Microsoft (-4.5%), Docusign (-24.2%), Adobe (-1.6%), and Google (-34.1%)— saw a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline.\n\nOn the other hand, social media phishing saw the highest QoQ growth of any sector. Phishing URLs impersonating social media brands increased 74.7% in Q1, reversing the trend of three straight quarters of decline. This growth comes from attacks impersonating two brands: Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\nFacebook and Instagram phishing surge\n\nFacebook phishing increased 155.5% in Q1, propelling the social media giant into the #4 spot. Facebook was actually the #1 impersonated brand in Q1 2018, but then saw three straight quarters of decline, dropping to the #7 spot in Q4 2018.\n\n[Facebook phishing trend, Phishers' Favorites Q1 2019]\n\nIt’s hard to know precisely why phishers are suddenly interested in Facebook credentials again. One plausible explanation could be the rise of social sign-on using Facebook accounts. With a set of Facebook credentials, hackers can see what other apps the user has authorized via social sign-on—and then compromise those accounts!\n\nAnother theory could be Facebook’s own questionable business practices, with recent headlines revealing that Facebook stored hundreds of millions of user passwords in plain text, and required some new users’ email passwords in order to sign up. Hackers could be taking advantage of the confusion and concerns of Facebook users to lure them into clicking on phishing pages. \n\n[Instagram Phishing Trend, Phishers' Favorites, Q1 2019]\n\nInstagram is another interesting example. For three quarters, Instagram phishing was virtually nonexistent. Then suddenly, in Q1, the number of URLs exploded 1,868.8%! What drove such massive growth? At the beginning of March, a number of news outlets reported on a wave of phishing emails claiming to offer a verified Instagram badge to trick recipients into providing their credentials. This same phishing attack was detected by Vade Secure’s technology.\n\n[Instagram Phishing Page: Verified Badge Scam]\nInstagram phishing page: verified badge scam\n\n\nMONDAYS AND TUESDAYS ARE THE TOP DAYS FOR PHISHING\n\nThe most popular days for phishing attacks shifted from Tuesday and Wednesday in Q4 2018 to Monday and Tuesday in Q1 2019. The middle three days were Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And the bottom two days for phishing were Saturday and Sunday.\n\n[Day of Week Phishing Trend, Phishers' Favorites, Q1 2019]\n\nLooking at individual brands, Microsoft phishing attacks follow the overall trend, spiking on Monday and Tuesday; remaining strong Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; and then dropping significantly over the weekend. Given the focus on Office 365 – versus Microsoft’s consumer products and services – hackers are clearly trying to take advantage of professionals being in the office and active on email during the week to increase their odds of success.\n\n\nMicrosoft phishing dominates weekdays, PayPal phishing weekends\n\nTo further illustrate the prevalence of Microsoft phishing on weekdays, we looked at which brand had the most new phishing URLs on each single day in Q1. Then we tallied up the results for all 90 days in the quarter. Microsoft was the #1 phished brand on 72% of weekdays, followed by PayPal (23%) and Facebook (3%).\n\n[Single Day Highs, Phishers' Favorites, Q1 2019]\n\nLooking at single day totals for the weekend days in Q1, the results shifted to PayPal (73%), followed by Facebook (11%) and Netflix (8%).\n\nWhat’s clear across the board is that while there are many consistencies from quarter to quarter (e.g. Microsoft being the #1 target), hackers show no limit to their creativity. The way they construct their attacks—from the message content to the techniques they use to trick recipients—continues to evolve very rapidly.  To learn how to mitigate threats to Office 365, read the IDC Analyst Connection: Email Security: Maintaining a High Bar When Moving to Office 365.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter for our latest posts\n\nFollow us\n\n\n",

    "passage": "With her red cotton dress, white shoulder bag and flowing black hair, she has become the colour-coded emblem of TURKEY'S new people-power movement.\n\nCaught on camera as she was sprayed head to toe in tear gas, Ceyda Sungur's treatment at the hands of Istanbul's riot police seemed the epitome of using a \"sledgehammer to crack a nut\" and encapsulated the government's heavy-handed response to a civilised protest.\n\nPictures of the \"Lady in the Red Dress\" quickly spread around the world via the internet. Those who shared the pictures online joined protesters in demanding to know why a woman who looked attired for a summer picnic had been treated like a masked, brick-throwing\nanarchist.\n\nBut for Ms Sungur it is unwanted fame. Last week she described herself as just part of a wider grass-roots movement, and pointed out in brief remarks to a Turkish newspaper that hundreds of others had been gassed in similar fashion.\n\nHaving declined requests for interviews from all over the world, Ms Sungur, an academic, has spoken briefly but vividly to The Sunday Telegraph about her involvement in what happened, how she is now working in a makeshift clinic to help others hurt in demonstrations, and how she hopes the attention can now be shifted away from her.\n\n\"For me this is about freedom of speech and the power of the people,\" said Ms Sungur, who was left choking for breath after the gas attack.\n\n\"Now people have, for the first time, the self-confidence to reclaim their power. They have the self-confidence to change everything.\"\n\nThe photos of Ms Sungur set off a major escalation of the protests, which have pitted Turkey's secular middle class against what they see as an increasingly authoritarian Islamist government.\n\nSo far three people have been killed and nearly 1,000 admitted to hospital, as the demonstrations have spread across the country.\n\nAs well as being shared via Facebook, Twitter and other social media, Ms Sungur's image has become a permanent part of the protest landscape, appearing as a cartoon on posters, stickers and banners.\n\nProtesters in the city of Izmir have even turned the image into a fairground-style billboard, where demonstrators can poke their head through a hole where her face is and posing for pictures.\n\nKeen to keep out of the limelight, Ms Sungur, meanwhile, is continuing to work behind the scenes, volunteering at an improvised field hospital in Taksim Square, the epicentre of the Istanbul protests.\n\n\"We have created field stations on Taksim Square where we look after people who have been injured,\" she said, declining to specify further details for fear that the volunteer doctors might be arrested.\n\nMs Sungur works in the planning department of Istanbul's Technical University, a faculty not normally seen as a hotbed of radical politics.\n\nShe had little inkling of the anti-government revolt she was about to unleash when she and a group of architect friends first joined a sit-in to stop bulldozers moving in on Gazi Park, a small patch of green in Taksim Square.\n\nThose friends described to _The Sunday Telegraph_ their shock at what happened next. \"Ceyda texted me to get to the park,\" said Meriç Demir, 28. \"Ten to 15 minutes later when we arrived she was yelling from the effect of the tear gas.\n\nMeric\\ Demir.\\ (RUTH\\ SHERLOCK\\ FOR\\ THE\\ SUNDAY\\ TELEGRAPH)\n\n\"We were so surprised. Some of us began yelling, 'we are academics, stop this!' Some tried to help Ceyda. We were shocked because you don't even spray insects in your home in such a direct way.\"\n\nOn paper, the protest was little more than an impassioned planning dispute, with a group of environmentalists opposing a government-backed project for an ambitious redevelopment of the area.\n\nTurkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, insisted the redevelopment would be a massive improvement, with a new shopping centre, a pedestrianised zone, an opera house, a cultural centre and a mosque.\n\nBut critics said that as well as involving the demolition of Gazi Park – one of the few green \"lungs\" in the area – it would amount to a creeping \"Islamisation\" of central Istanbul. In addition to the mosque, the plans included rebuilding an Ottoman-era military barracks that was the scene of a failed Islamist military uprising in 1909.\n\nProtesters also claimed the decision to press ahead was made without proper public consultation, which they said epitomised Mr Erdogan's high-handed, authoritarian style.\n\nAs such, when the police moved in to clear the protesters – and Ms Sungur's ordeal was conveyed to the wider world – the protest mushroomed into a much wider expression of popular discontent.\n\nIn Taksim Square, which has since been occupied completely by demonstrators, a wide range of grievances can be heard.\n\nThe\\ protests\\ continued\\ in\\ Taksim\\ Square\\ this\\ weekend.\\ (BULENT\\ KILIC/AFP)\n\nMany complain about the government's recent decision to ban alcohol sales between 10pm and 6am and from shops close to schools and mosques. Others are angry at recent attempts to ban kissing in the streets.\n\n\"You cannot touch everyone's lives like this. Erdogan's policies are too invasive,\" said Ms Demir. \"It's not even about the alcohol. This is about respect.\"\n\nTaksim Square is also a traditional rallying point for secular Turks, whose spiritual leader, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, made the country a civil state nearly a century ago, viewing Islamic rule as a brake on the country's development.\n\n\"Taksim is a symbol of the Turkish Ataturk revolution,\" said Prof Handan Turkoglu, 57, Ms Sungur's department head, who has launched a petition protesting against Mr Erdogan's plans and was herself tear-gassed with her students.\n\nFor its signatories, the battle against the development is now a metaphor for the fight over the state of the nation; a fight to stop Turkey's secular democracy turning into a system where the lines between religion and state are blurred.\n\nDuring more than a decade in power Mr Erdogan has determinedly dragged Turkey away from the aggressively secular, anti-religious dictatorship of Ataturk in the 1920s. So confident is he that he seemed at one point to be identifying himself with the Ottoman emperors, calling one of his newly built mosques Selatin, meaning a religious building constructed at the request of a sultan.\n\nHe has since gone further, announcing a new bridge over the Bosphorus to be called the Yavuz Sultan Selim. Sultan Selim the Grim is particularly reviled by a substantial Turkish minority, the Alevis, for his brutality towards them during a 16th-century war with the Persian empire.\n\nMr Erdogan's political success has made him an ambiguous character for both Turkey's traditional friends in the West and his own people. The West welcomes his liberal economic reforms – obedient to diktats from the International Monetary Fund – which have empowered businessmen and seen the economy triple in size.\n\nBut many of those businessmen are close to his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and are socially conservative, backing his attempts to encourage religious norms such as the hijab, women's headscarves, and restrictions on alcohol. They are also changing the face of many of Turkey's cities with modern, some say garish, Gulf-style developments like that planned for Taksim.\n\nThe West has meanwhile supported Mr Erdogan's close involvement in the Syrian rebel cause – dominated by Sunni Muslims, the majority creed in Turkey – but it has not been so popular at home, where it has been seen to drag the country into a war many feel is none of its business.\n\nThe main issue, though, has become Mr Erdogan's personal style of leadership: confident to the point of cocky, and clear in his view that three landslide election victories, most recently in 2011, have given him a mandate to push through his vision.\n\nIt is the air of personal invincibility that wins him passionate support among his rural base but also stirs so much resentment among the secular, liberal demonstrators in Taksim Square.\n\nThey accuse him of running a tyranny of the majority, ignoring the 49 per cent who did not vote for him in the last election.\n\n\"Yes I know the prime minister is elected by half the country,\" said Ms Demir. \"But there is another half of the country who also want to be listened to as well.\"\n\nOzgur Ogret, a freelance journalist and analyst, said Mr Erdogan's policies were making those loyal to Turkey's modern secular customs feel \"what the Kurds have been facing for decades, and the kind of suppression that Muslims were subjected to [under Ataturk].\"\n\nProtesters in Taksim and in more than 67 cities across the country say Mr Erdogan has misunderstood what democracy means in the modern day, except for the crude fact of winning elections.\n\nMost protesters are realistic enough to know that, despite the banners and graffiti calling for him to resign, this is unlikely to happen, and that he may still win the next election, but they are saying democracy must also take into account the attitudes of the minority.\n\nThey also object to creeping encroachment on press and other freedoms, which has also been criticised by international human rights groups.\n\n\"Cities need green open spaces, breathing gaps. It shouldn’t be a source of conflict between the government and the citizens. It’s a delicate matter about human rights and public benefit,\" said Eren Kurkcuoglu, an architect. \"That’s what we’re trying to teach our students, now they experience it very well. We have to be careful and watch our sentences. But government too has to be careful in how to treat us.\"\n\nBack on Taksim Square yesterday, the protests continued. A decision to withdraw the police has given the square a feel of a summertime British music festival, with tents, food stalls and drummers.\n\nMr Erdogan, who has dismissed the demonstrators as \"a few looters\" backed by extremists, was also meeting his advisers to plan his next steps. He still insists he has the country on his side.\n\nThe Lady in Red will be observing closely and sternly.\n\n\"In Istanbul, I have watched people stop a Metro in its tracks when they need to get on it,\" she said.\n\n\"That is like the power people feel now. They have the self-confidence to change everything.\"\n",

    "passage": "[MF] Untitled\n\nI'm not certain [MF] is the proper tag, but I wrote something I would like to share. I'm pretty new to writing, but I was pretty happy with this after finishing it. Titles are hard, and this doesn't have one yet. I apologize for the poor formatting. Feedback is welcome.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nHe was alone, not just separate, truly alone, walking through an empty city, desolate and unchanging. Buildings were thrown up to either side, useless and crumbling. Everything had been used up, and, now, it was time to move on.\n\nHe took what meager supplies he had, and he packed them together well enough to be moved. It didn’t matter much to him which way he went, the city stretched on in every direction, spread out in a careful grid pattern, despite the total lack of care now apparent within every cell of table. He decided to go south simply because it seemed easiest. There was no one left to ask, so the path of least resistance decided much of what he did. \n\nNavigating his way out of the city was simple. Many of the signs still stood, and he didn’t particularly care where he ended up once he was out. He followed the roads through the city, and, eventually, the buildings became less dense and nature began to encroach on what used to be the territory of man.\n\nHe walked for several days, making camp along the way to stop, and he began to slow when it seemed as though nature had won and taken over entirely. Anything left of civilization was in ruins; the road was broken and overgrown and the buildings that used to stand proud were now little more than foundation and dust.\n\nTo the west, there was a winding and violent river flowing from an unknown source far away, and, on the opposite side, there was a dense forest. The two were so different it was almost startling; one threatening to smash him to bits against the rocks, and the other hiding who knows what within, telling nothing.\n\nAs he became more familiar with his surroundings, he could pay more attention to the finer details of what was around him. He noticed the animals in the trees and the ants between the cracks in the road. Nothing he saw interested him much, until one morning, he saw a figure standing within the overgrowth at the edge of the road.\n\nCould it be true? Perhaps he was hallucinating, having eaten something tainted, but he couldn’t dismiss this sighting. Could this be a person like him, looking desperately for another? He doubted it. It all seemed too good to be true. When the world was in ruins, being kind wasn’t a high priority for many. He began to wonder whether it was even worth the risk in trying. The figure was far away, and it may not have even seen him yet. He could simply wait it out, or turn and leave.\n\nHe thought about his conundrum for a short time, but eventually the figure made the decision for him and darted off into the trees.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nShe had just risen. She awoke, but didn’t leave right away. She lay staring up at the ash gray sky, watching the clouds float about. What reason was there to rush anymore? There were no deadlines.\n \nShe lazily rose up and moved out from her camp to look around. Nothing had changed, as always. Nothing ever changed anymore. She stood, watching, and she began to wonder why she even kept trying. All that was left was trying to survive, and doing so alone was exceedingly dull.\n\nShe stood staring across at the raging, the only thing that ever moved anymore, until she noticed something down the road. It was someone else.\n\nHer calm, uncaring attitude quickly evaporated and was replaced with panic. None of her dealings with people had gone well since the world had moved on. Everyone left was treacherous and thieving. How could she trust anyone? Could she even gamble approaching the person? Then again, what had she to lose? No matter what happened, this person promised an end to the monotony, but she wasn’t so bold as to run out in front of what could be a terrible end for her.\n\nShe decided to hide for a while and just observe. If the man seemed safe, she could approach later, but, for the time being, she would watch.\n\nShe ran back to her camp within the trees and packed up what she could carry. She left a little to make it seem like someone would be returning. She would test this new person to see if he really was a thieving vulture like the rest.\n\nShe left her camp and ran off, but she watched the road still, out of sight. She wanted to believe that this stranger could be good, but she didn’t need to take undue chances.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nHe had seen the figure run off in a hurry, but he couldn’t know for sure what had happened. Had the figure seen him and gotten frightened? Was there some larger threat that he too should be worried about? Could it be as trivial as the stranger’s breakfast was burning?\n\nHe had little to work with, but he couldn’t stand being alone any longer. He was given a chance at something better, and he wouldn’t let this opportunity pass him by.\n\nHe continued down the road, now with a quicker pace. He had slowed before as the road became more treacherous, but now he had a goal. He had something to go for. He had to find this person.\n\nHe went on, but began having doubts as he approached. He had been so far away when he saw it. He couldn’t even be sure it was what he thought, and even if it was, what if they were a nomad too? His hope for another could have just walked on without ever knowing he had existed.\n\nHe didn’t have time to entertain these thoughts, and he hurriedly pushed them from his thoughts. He would keep going.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nAfter what felt like many miles, he saw where the figure had stood. The grass was depressed from frequent travel, and it appeared to make a path off into the trees. He couldn’t see beyond the tree line, and the doubts came back.\n\nWhat if this person wasn’t friendly? What if they were in there, waiting to kill him as he approached? He had no idea, and he began to fall back from the entrance. \n\nHe sat across from it and stared. He couldn’t glean any information from such a simple thing. There was nothing to learn about the person within from sitting outside. He decided the only way to learn was to go in. He would risk it. An end to his loneliness was worth whatever was waiting within.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nAs he made his way into the camp, he began to worry once more. Had he made the wrong decision? It was too late to turn back now, and he continued deeper.\n\nThe trail ended at a small clearing with what appeared to be someone’s home. There were still burning embers in the fire that sat in the center of the clearing, and a shelter had been erected at the edge of the dense trees. Things had been left by the shelter. He saw a knife and a piece of flint. Surely whoever had brought them here and set all this up would be returning, he thought to himself as he stood at the entrance to the clearing, hesitant to invade someone’s personal space.\n\nHe would wait here, and, if they came back, he could be friendly. He saw no better course of action. If they did return, the up side of his decision could be enormous, and, if no one ever came back, he may have found himself a place to stay for more than a single night.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nShe saw him enter. This stranger had gone into her camp, and she would wait for him to leave before she risked going back. She could check her things, and, from that, she could at least begin to decide whether this new person was worth the risk. It had taken long enough for him to get there, and she could wait a bit longer for him to leave.\n\nHours passed, and soon it was beginning to fall dark. She had never considered he might move in. What could she do now? If he had, waiting outside was hardly the proper plan to learn more. She would need to initiate; she might even need to take back what was hers. She had to back inside despite the risks involved.\n\nShe waited for what felt like an eternity, building the courage to breach what had once been her safe place. As she approached what used to be the one place where she was comfortable, she became increasingly nervous and struggled to advance.\n\nThe trees that had once protected her from what was beyond now hid from her the potential dangers within. Everything had changed with the stranger, and now her camp felt like an alien place. Everything along the way that had once welcomed her in now shouted at her to turn around. Everything about the situation made her want to turn and run, but she wouldn’t. What was she running to? She had to at least investigate what had been laid out before her.\n\nAs she turned the final corner to what had been her home, she saw a man sitting among her things beside her shelter. They both froze, and neither party was willing to do anything for fear of startling the other.\n\n~~---------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nHe watched as the figure turned the corner, and the panic he had felt when he first saw the figure returned. He knew there was no changing his decision now, but he wished he could. He was backed into a corner now, and he felt completely at the mercy of this stranger whose home he had invaded.\n\nShe stood, watching the other as a deer stares into the headlights of the approaching threat, but she wouldn’t run. She had set her mind on it now; she would not back down until she knew.\n\nShe watched him, but he did nothing. He made no move against her; he only returned her stare. If he was hostile, he surely would have acted by now, she thought, but couldn’t truly believe. She couldn’t wait forever, and a few seconds or hours more would do nothing to change what would happen after. He would either be safe or not, there was nothing to do now but find out.\n\nSo she sat.\n\nHe was startled at how, all at once, her appearance changed from startled to calm. She had changed so drastically he didn’t know what to make of it. Her calmness disturbed him slightly, but he couldn’t wait any longer.\n\nHe began, and they spoke for a while. It began hesitant on both ends, neither knew how to begin such a strange encounter, but they both slowly began to open up. They talked on and on, but what they talked about didn’t matter.\n\nThey were no longer alone. \n",

That would be a major scalp. It would also be a coup for the party to regain middle England marginals such as Telford in Shropshire from the Tories: Corbyn did a well-attended rally here in recent days. Thurrock will also be fascinating as it was a three-way marginal between the Tory incumbent and Ukip and Labour challengers. If Ukip collapses, which way will its former voters swing?\n\n[Nigel Farage campaigning in Thurrock last week.]\n\nNigel Farage campaigning in Thurrock last week. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images\n\n\n2.30am\n\nCorbyn’s Islington North will declare. This will certainly stay Labour but will be worth watching for his victory speech – whether he is sounding triumphant or working out how to pitch defeat.\n\n\n3am-4am\n\nA swath of Scottish seats will be announcing their results, which should give a hint about whether the Conservatives and Labour are seeing any kind of revival against the dominance of the SNP, which won 56 out of 59 seats last time. The Tories would love to remove Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader, in Moray, as well as targeting areas of Edinburgh and South Aberdeen. Labour would like to claw back East Renfrewshire, East Lothian, and Edinburgh North and Leith among others.\n\n[Jeremy Corbyn campaigning in Glasgow.]\n\nJeremy Corbyn campaigning in Glasgow. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\n\n3.30am\n\nWatch out for the result of strongly pro-EU Vauxhall, where there has been a concerted Lib Dem effort to unseat the Brexit-supporting Labour MP Kate Hoey, who memorably shared a photoshoot on a flotilla with Nigel Farage. It is a long shot but Tim Farron’s party has been going after torn former remain voters hard. Not long after, expect a battle over Bermondsey and Old Southwark, where Sir Simon Hughes, a former Lib Dem minister, is trying to get his old seat back from Labour’s Neil Coyle.\n\n[Kate Hoey and Nigel Farage on the leave flotilla last year.]\n\nKate Hoey and Nigel Farage on the leave flotilla last year. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n4am\n\nCurtice will pop up on the BBC to give his considered view on whether his exit poll was on the money and further observations about how the night has unfolded so far. This is likely to be one of the better places to find a considered view on how the parties are doing – although better still will be the Guardian’s unmissable live blog and stories through the night.\n\n\n4am\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are not expected to have the revival they hoped for but they are targeting three remain-voting seats held by Conservatives – Twickenham, where the former business secretary Vince Cable is running, Bath and Cheltenham. They are also after the SNP’s East Dunbartonshire, fought by former minister Jo Swinson. But Lib Dems are at risk in several more seats, including Tom Brake in Carshalton and Wallington, Norman Lamb in North Norfolk and even possibly Farron in Westmorland and Lonsdale.\n\n[Vince Cable and Tim Farron campaigning in Twickenham.]\n\nVince Cable and Tim Farron campaigning in Twickenham. Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n4am-5am\n\nThis is the most exciting time of the night, as a deluge of results from key swing seats across the country come through. Labour will be hoping to gain seats such as Gower and Vale of Clwyd in Wales, where it has been performing better in recent weeks, Croydon Central and Hendon in London, the Plymouth seats, and Lincoln.\n\nThe Conservatives have been throwing a multitude of resources at Nottinghamshire seats such as Gedling, and across the West Midlands in Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley and parts of Birmingham, Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent. Watch Cumbria as well to see if the new Tory MP Trudy Harris can repeat her byelection victory over Labour in Copeland, and whether the anti-Corbyn Labour MP John Woodcock can save his seat in Barrow-in-Furness.\n\n\n4.30am\n\nFrustrated NHS staff might want to tune in at this point to see whether Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative health secretary, has been defeated by an independent candidate backed by some local Labour members, Greens and Liberal Democrats in South West Surrey. It would be a huge – though unlikely – coup.\n\n[Dr Louise Irvine of the National Health Action party in Haslemere, part of Jeremy Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency.]\n\nDr Louise Irvine of the National Health Action party in Haslemere, part of Jeremy Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency.

Two ultra marginals, Halifax in Yorkshire and Chester in Cheshire, could easily swing to the Tories at this time but Corbyn will be having an excellent night if he manages to keep them.\n\n\n5.30am\n\nPaul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, is contesting Boston and Skegness, a heavily leave-voting area that has been represented by a former remain Tory, Matt Warman. His chances are slim though, and there will be questions over his leadership if he fails and Ukip’s vote collapses across the country overall.\n\n[A Ukip sign in Boston, Lincolnshire.]\n\nA Ukip sign in Boston, Lincolnshire. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\n\n6am\n\nMay’s seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire will declare, and she will give a speech at the count. It should be pretty clear where the result has headed by this point.\n\n\n6am\n\nA few more interesting marginals will be trickling in at this time. Labour will be very keen to win back Derby North, contested by Corbyn’s ally Chris Williamson. Also look out for Brighton Kemptown, a Tory seat, and Brentford and Isleworth, a Labour marginal, where the Green candidates have stood aside to help boost Corbyn’s party. They are key tests of the effectiveness of the progressive alliance theory.\n\n\n7am\n\nSouth Thanet will be extremely interesting because its Tory incumbent candidate, Craig Mackinlay, has been charged with electoral offences relating to the 2015 contest when he saw off Nigel Farage. Will the people of Ramsgate and Broadstairs give him the boot – and Ukip or Labour a chance instead?\n\n[A woman holds a sign at an anti-Ukip demonstration in Ramsgate.]\n\nA woman holds a sign at an anti-Ukip demonstration in Ramsgate. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images\n\n\n7am\n\nThere could still be dozens of seats left to declare but, by breakfast time, it should be obvious who has won the night or if there will be a hung parliament. Dimbleby will retire for some sleep, while the campaign advisers will be hurriedly organising victory or concession speeches.\n\nIf the Conservatives are ahead at this stage, the key question for May will be by how much. When she called the election her party had 330 seats to Labour’s 229, and her working majority was 17. A majority of less than this would represent a serious setback, and a figure of 30 or less would prompt questions about her leadership. She will be satisfied with a majority of more than 50, pleased at 70 and delighted with 80 to 100, a figure implied by ICM and some of the pollsters.\n\nGuardian/ICM poll\n[Theresa May at Smithfield Market in the City of London on the final day of campaigning.]\n\nTheresa May at Smithfield Market in the City of London on the final day of campaigning. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA\nMeanwhile, if defeated, expect the Labour leader’s team to compare his share of the vote with Miliband’s 30.4% in 2015 as a sign of a successful campaign and an argument that he should stay on as leader. Anti-Corbyn forces in Labour will begin to argue that any failure to win a majority should result in his resignation.\n\nLabour support since 1979\nBut if the Conservatives lose their majority, strategists will be quickly trying to work out whether May can govern with the help of the DUP in Northern Ireland. If the arithmetic allows, Corbyn could try to form a minority government supported on a vote-by-vote basis by the SNP, Lib Dems and an array of small parties. In that case, there would be huge pressure on May from within her own party to resign – with Rudd and Boris Johnson two potential successors.\n\nAnd if Corbyn wins outright, Labour will be jubilant and a lot of people will have to eat a lot of humble pie about his electability. No poll, though, has shown Labour to be ahead.\n\n\nMidday\n\nOnly a handful of seats are not being counted overnight. The last official results will be in from Berwick, Blyth Valley and Wansbeck. It should be clear who the prime minister will be unless there is a complex coalition situation. Whoever has won will head off to the Queen to tell her that she or he is in a position to form a government.\n\n[The Queen]\n\nWaiting for a visit. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n",

    "passage": "Under Secretary of Agriculture for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services\n\nThe UNDER SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE FOR FARM AND FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES was the third-ranking official in the United States Department of Agriculture prior to reorganization of several mission areas, announced on May 11, 2017. The mission area of USDA's purpose was to “help to keep America's farmers and ranchers in business as they face the uncertainties of weather and markets...” and that “...deliver[s] commodity, credit, conservation, disaster, and emergency assistance programs that help improve the stability and strength of the agricultural economy.”[1] The Under Secretary was traditionally appointed to serve as the President of the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\nThe Under Secretary was appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate to serve at the pleasure of the President. The Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area was divided into the mission areas of Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, completing the creation of an Undersecretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs which was mandated by the 2014 Farm Bill.\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe Under Secretary is the principal officer of the United States Department of Agriculture charged with administering programs and providing services which focus on supporting a sustainable and competitive American agricultural system. The Under Secretary administers agricultural commodity insurance, farm loans, conservation, environmental, emergency assistance, and domestic and international food assistance programs. These programs are intended to provide cost-effective means of managing risk for agricultural producers in order to improve the economic stability of agriculture. The Under Secretary's mission area also represents the diverse interests of the U.S. food and agricultural sector abroad by managing the Department's international activities, addressing market access constraints, and working to expand markets for U.S. agricultural, fish and forest products overseas.\n\nThe Under Secretary provides leadership and oversight for the Farm Service Agency, the Risk Management Agency, and the Foreign Agricultural Service. The President normally appoints the Under Secretary as President of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), though in the past this latter responsibility has sometimes been held by other USDA officials. The Under Secretary for FFAS also normally chairs the interagency Food Assistance Policy Council and is a member of the interagency Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG).\n\nThe Under Secretary is the third highest-ranking official within the Agriculture Department, ranking behind the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, and holds a Level III position within the Executive Schedule. Since January 2010, the annual rate of pay for Level III is $165,300.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Department of Agriculture was made a Cabinet-level department in 1889. For many years, the Secretary of Agriculture supervised chiefs of bureaus of the Department, as was the norm throughout the U.S. government. Subsequently, a single subcabinet position of Assistant Secretary was created. Over time, this position was upgraded to Under Secretary, under which in turn was a single Assistant Secretary.\n\nIn 1953, Secretary Ezra Taft Benson lobbied for the creation of additional Assistant Secretary positions, which Congress approved that summer. Two of these positions, the Assistant Secretary for the Foreign Agricultural Service and the Assistant Secretary for Commodity Marketing and Adjustment, were merged in September 1953, and in December of that year the vacant position was redesignated Assistant Secretary for Stabilization. Between 1953 and 1962 the responsibilities of today's Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services were thus shared by two Assistant Secretaries, for “Stabilization” and for “Marketing and Foreign Agriculture”. The former oversaw the Commodity Stabilization Service and its successors, including the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, while the latter oversaw the Agricultural Marketing Service and the Foreign Agricultural Service. In 1963, the positions were reshuffled, with foreign agriculture (oversight of the Foreign Agricultural Service and the newly created International Agricultural Development Service) assigned to an Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and marketing and stabilization combined under an Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Consumer Services. In 1969, responsibility for both foreign affairs and farm support (stabilization) programs was consolidated into a single position entitled Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Commodity Programs, with marketing remaining under its own, separate Assistant Secretary.\n\nThe Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 upgraded the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Commodity Programs to Under Secretary. At the time, it was the only Under Secretary-level subcabinet position in USDA, as the official previously called Under Secretary had been retitled as Deputy Secretary, in keeping with common U.S. government practice. Subsequent USDA reorganizations, notably that of 1994, upgraded most USDA subcabinet officials to Under Secretary status, however.\n\nDorothy Jacobson, a longtime aide to Orville Freeman, was the first woman appointed to one of these positions, in 1964. This made her the first woman to serve in a subcabinet position in USDA.[2]\n\nAnother former assistant secretary, James T. Ralph, was a figure in the Billie Sol Estes scandal and was forced to leave Federal service. This scandal led directly to the 1963 shakeup of USDA, a reassignment of responsibilities for oversight of commodity programs, and investigation of allegations of corrupt activities by state-level employees of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.\n\nAs trade in agricultural products continued to expand, and foreign markets became the primary destination for many U.S. grown commodities, there was increasing pressure to have a more visible member of USDA dedicated solely to expanding trade opportunities and resolving issues. Section 3208 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 mandated “The Secretary... shall propose a reorganization of international trade functions for imports and exports of the Department of Agriculture.”[3] Though enacted on February 7, 2014, the plan to formalize the reorganization was not announced until May 11, 2017.[4] The plan put forth by USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue dissolved the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area and created a new mission area for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, which houses the Foreign Agricultural Service, and the Farm Production and Conservation mission area, which contains the Farm Service Agency, Risk Management Agency, and Natural Resources Conservation Service (previously a part of the Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) mission area).\n\n\nReporting officials\n\nOfficials reporting to the Under Secretary include:\n\n-   Deputy Under Secretary of Agriculture for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services\n-   Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service\n-   Administrator, Farm Service Agency\n-   Administrator, Risk Management Agency\n\n\nOfficeholders\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION\n  Romeo Ennis Short, Assistant Secretary for the Foreign Agricultural Service, July 21, 1953 – September 28, 1953\n  Ross Rizley, Assistant Secretary, December 1953 – December 1954\n  James A.

    "passage": "Radical democracy\n\nRADICAL DEMOCRACY is a type of democracy that advocates the radical extension of equality and liberty.[1] Radical democracy is concerned with a radical extension of equality and freedom, following the idea that democracy is an un-finished, inclusive, continuous and reflexive process.[2]\n\n\nTheories\n\nWithin radical democracy there are three distinct strands, as articulated by Lincoln Dahlberg.[3] These strands can be labeled as deliberative, agonistic and autonomist.\n\nThe first and most noted strand of radical democracy is the agonistic perspective, which is associated with the work of Laclau and Mouffe. Radical democracy was articulated by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe in their book _Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics_, written in 1985. They argue that social movements which attempt to create social and political change need a strategy which challenges neoliberal and neoconservative concepts of democracy.[4] This strategy is to expand the liberal definition of democracy, based on freedom and equality, to include difference.[5]\n\nAccording to Laclau and Mouffe “Radical democracy” means “the root of democracy”.[6] Laclau and Mouffe claim that liberal democracy and deliberative democracy, in their attempts to build consensus, oppress differing opinions, races, classes, genders, and worldviews.[7] In the world, in a country, and in a social movement there are many (a plurality of) differences which resist consensus. Radical democracy is not only accepting of difference, dissent and antagonisms, but is dependent on it.[8] Laclau and Mouffe argue based on the assumption that there are oppressive power relations that exist in society and that those oppressive relations should be made visible, re-negotiated and altered.[9] By building democracy around difference and dissent, oppressive power relations existing in societies are able to come to the forefront so that they can be challenged.[10]\n\nThe second strand, deliberative, is mostly associated with the work of Jürgen Habermas. This strand of radical democracy is opposed to the agonistic perspective of Laclau and Mouffe. Habermas argues that political problems surrounding the organization of life can be resolved by deliberation.[11] That is, people coming together and deliberating on the best possible solution. This type of radical democracy is in contrast with the agonistic perspective based on consensus and communicative means: there is a reflexive critical process of coming to the best solution.[12] Equality and freedom are at the root of Habermas´ deliberative theory. The deliberation is established through institutions that can ensure free and equal participation of all.[13] Habermas is aware of the fact that different cultures, world-views and ethics can lead to difficulties in the deliberative process. Despite this fact he argues that the communicative reason can create a bridge between opposing views and interests.[14]\n\nThe third strand of radical democracy is the autonomist strand, which is associated with left-communist and post-Marxist ideas. The difference between this type of radical democracy and the two noted above is the focus on “the community.”[15] The community is seen as the pure constituted power instead of the deliberative rational individuals or the agonistic groups as in the first two strands. The community resembles a “plural multitude” (of people) instead of the working class in traditional Marxist theory.[16] This plural multitude is the pure constituted power and reclaims this power by searching and creating mutual understandings within the community.[17] This strand of radical democracy challenges the traditional thinking about equality and freedom in liberal democracies by stating that individual equality can be found in the singularities within the multitude, equality overall is created by an all-inclusive multitude and freedom is created by restoring the multitude in its pure constituted power.[18] This strand of radical democracy is often a term used to refer to the post-Marxist perspectives of Italian radicalism - for example Paolo Virno.\n\n\nTheorists\n\nAgonistic perspective\n\n-   William E. Connolly - Connoly is associated with his promotion of an agonistic democracy. An agonistic democracy is focused on contestation rather than on rational consensus.[19] The discourse is not violence-based, but engages different aspects of political conflict. According to Connoly an agonistic democracy is based on a term he calls ¨agonistic respect¨, which allows people to honor different sources and conflicting opinions.[20]\n-   Ernesto Laclau - Associated with the agonistic strand of radical democracy as articulated in _Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics._\n-   Chantal Mouffe - Associated with the agonistic strand of radical democracy as articulated in _Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics._\n-   Roberto Mangabeira Unger - Roberto Mangabeira Unger argues that society does not emerge from consensus, compromising and looking for the best option, but from struggle and political contestation.[21] Unger is a proponent of the vision of an empowered democracy, which would involve radical changes at politics in the centre. These changes would involve more social institutions in which everyone can interact, discuss and effectively empower themselves to drastically change economic, political and social circumstances.[22]\n-   Sheldon S. Wolin - Wolin's political thought clearly aligns with the ideal of an participatory democracy.[23] Wolin was the first in articulating the idea of a ¨fugitive democracy¨ in which democracy is a political experience and the ordinary people are the primary political actors. Wolin challenged consensus and can therefore be position within the agonistic perspective of radical democracy.[24]\n\nAutonomist perspective\n\n-   Cornel West - West describes himself as a radical democrat and a non-Marxist socialist, which positions him in the critical post-Marxist strand of radical democracy.[25]\n-   Raya Dunayevskaya - Associated with the critical post-Marxist strand of radical democracy.\n-   Paolo Virno - Figurehead for the Italian Autonomist Marxist movement.\n\n\nCriticism\n\nAgonistic perspective\n\nLaclau and Mouffe have argued for radical agonistic democracy, where different opinions and worldviews are not oppressed by the search for consensus in liberal and deliberative democracy. As this agonistic perspective has been most influential in academic literature, it has been subject to most criticisms on the idea of radical democracy. Brockelman for example argues that the theory of radical democracy is an Utopian idea.[26] Political theory, he argues, should not be used as offering a vision of a desirable society. In the same vein, it is argued that radical democracy might be useful at the local level, but does not offer a realistic perception of decision-making on the national level.[27] For example, people might know what they want to see changing in their town and feel the urge to participate in the decision-making process of future local policy. Developing an opinion about issues at the local level often does not require specific skills or education. Deliberation in order to combat the problem of groupthink, in which the view of the majority dominates over the view of the minority, can be useful in this setting. However, people might not be skilled enough or willing to decide about national or international problems. A radical democracy approach for overcoming the flaws of democracy is, it is argued, not suitable for levels higher than the local one.\n\nDeliberative perspective\n\nHabermas and Rawls have argued for radical deliberative democracy, where consensus and communicative means are at the root of politics. However, some scholars identify multiple tensions between participation and deliberation. Three of these tensions are identified by Joshua Cohen, a student of the philosopher John Rawls:[28]\n\n1.  Wanting to improve the quality of deliberation can be at the expense of public participation. In this case, representatives and legislators are more focused on argumentation and deliberation than on seeking to advance the interests of their constituents. By focusing on reasonable deliberation the interests of particular constituents can be underrepresented.[29]\n2.  Conversely, seeking to maximize the public participation can be at the expense of the quality of deliberation. Maximize public participation can be accomplished by popular initiatives like referendums. Referendums however allows people to decide on an important topic with an yes/no vote. By using a yes/no vote people can be discouraged to engage in a reasoned discussion in creating legislation. It is also argued that through maximizing public participation, manipulation and suppression become present.[30]\n3.  Deliberation depends on sufficient knowledge and interests from all participants as well as adequate and easy accessible information. On many important issues however, the number of participators with sufficient knowledge is rather limited and thus the quality of deliberation declines when more uninformed participants enter the discussion.[31]\n\nRadical democracy and colonialism\n\nBecause of radical democracy's focus on difference, and challenging oppressive power relations, it has been seen as conducive to post-colonial theory and decolonization. However, the concept of radical democracy is seen in some circles as colonial in nature due to its reliance on a western notion of democracy.[32] It is argued that liberal democracy is viewed by the West as the only legitimate form of governance.[33] Spreading liberal democracy through international law as a condition for recognition from and trade with the West, can be seen as a form of new, informal imperialism. Radical democracy theory is criticized for being situated in this kind of Western modernity perspective. In their attempt of prescribing an ideal society, radical democracy theorists do not create a new kind, but rather reinvent the Western dominant tradition of liberal democracy. Also, radical democracy challenges consensus decision-making processes which are essential to many indigenous governing practices.[34]\n\n\nRe-interpretations and adaptations\n\nSince Laclau and Mouffe argued for a radical democracy, many other theorists and practitioners have adapted and changed the term.[35] For example, bell hooks and Henry Giroux have all written about the application of radical democracy in education. In Hook´s book _Teaching to Transgress: Education as the practice of freedom_ she argues for education where educators teach students to go beyond the limits imposed against racial, sexual and class boundaries in order to “achieve the gift of freedom”.[36] Paulo Freire's work, although initiated decades before Laclau and Mouffe, can also be read through similar lenses.[37][38][39] Theorists such as Paul Chatterton and Richard JF Day have written about the importance of radical democracy within some of the autonomous movements in Latin America (namely the EZLN—Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Mexico, the MST—Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil, and the Piquetero—Unemployed Workers Movement in Argentina) although the term radical democracy is used differently in these contexts.[40][41]\n\n\nRadical democracy and the internet\n\nWith the rise of the internet in the years after the development of various strands of radical democracy theory, the relationship between the internet and the theory has been increasingly focussed upon. The internet is regarded as an important aspect of radical democracy, as it provides a means for communication which is central to every approach to the theory.\n\nThe internet is believed to reinforce both the theory of radical democracy and the actual possibility of radical democracy through three distinct ways:[42]\n\n1.  The internet provides a platform for further discussion about radical democracy, thus contributing to the theory's development;\n2.  The internet allows new political communities and democratic cultures to emerge that challenge the existing political ideas;\n3.  The internet strengthens the voice of minority groups.\n\nThis last point refers to the concept of a _radical public sphere_ where voice in the political debate is given to otherwise oppressed or marginalized groups.[43] Approached from the radical democracy theory, the expression of such views on the internet can be understood as online activism. In current liberal representative democracies, certain voices and interests are always favoured above others. Through online activism, excluded opinions and views can still be articulated. In this way, activists contribute to the ideal of a heterogeneity of positions. However, the digital age does not necessarily contribute to the notion of radical democracy. Social media platforms possess the opportunity of shutting down certain, often radical, voices. This is counterproductive to radical democracy [44]\n\n\nContemporary mass movements committed to radical democracy\n\n-   The EZLN – Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Mexico: a far-left militant and political group. Their ideology is based on their aspiration to execute politics in a bottom-up, rather than top-down way.[45] The group has presented several laws in 1994, including laws to advance women's position in the country.[46]\n-   The MST – Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil: a social movement that aims at land reform to make land ownership more accessible for the poor. It claims to seek to achieve this goal through combating social issues such as racism, sexism and skewed income distributions.[47]\n-   The Piqueteros – Unemployed Workers Movement in Argentina.\n-   The Abahlali baseMjondolo – shack dwellers' movement in South Africa.\n-   The Socialist Party USA[48] this party was founded in 1973. It claims to be opposed to all forms of oppression, and to seek to create a “non-racist, classless, feminist and socialist society”.[49]\n-   JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke (translated Young Democrats/Young Left,JD/JL) - a left-wing political youth organization in Germany and the former youth wing of a liberal party called FDP.\n-   Radical Democracy Party (United States) – was an abolitionist and anti-Confederate political party in the United States.\n-   Radical Democracy Party (Chile) – Chilean Centre-right political party created in 1969, and disbanded in 1990.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] Dahlberg, L.

    "passage": "[MF] Opening Up\n\nMervs is a hole; a working class dive bar in downtown Mountain View, CA, with a 60 year history of serving cheap drinks—in a narrow hole in the wall behind a second rate Chinese restaurant—that Nick Fitzpatrick, a huge tank of a man, is a regular at.  Mountain View, near wholly gentrified by now is still sprawling with cheap, blue collar opportunity and fun, just beyond the purview of google employees and city hipsters, the town has a culture if you can find it. It’s not all suburban wasteland. It’s nothing like Los Altos, the sleepy and equally dreary bedroom community to which Mountain View is so curiously juxtaposed, surely the men who had built the majority of the small and overpriced ranch homes of that town had come to Mervs for a drink at the end of the day too.\n \tThere are secrets all over town. The hidden harddrive in that police officers closet, the one who they let work with all the kids at the elementary school. Even the neighboring Los Altos Hills, the sprawling hilly community for the upper bourgeois of the area that had become the pot smoking retreat for it’s neighbors youth. The neighbor who lived across the way, whose house a mysterious car always visits during the workday, sitting so brilliantly, arrogantly in it’s bright red blaze, lifted and on big black off road tires, sitting like inky muck on pearlescent rims. Even the jerk who steals the paper in the morning.\n     “Who even does that?” \nNick says with disdain, in a booming and commanding voice beyond his control, a voice that brought nearly the entire bars attention on him with the accentuation of every vowel; sharing somebodys secret.\n      “Who even steals a paper? I mean it’s not like it’s that expensive, his house costs as much as mine surely.”\n     “Yeah!”\nThe barfly says wistfully and with a bit of anger in his voice\n     “Man if I caught someone stealing, I’d take the guy out for a beer, ask him out for a cigarette, and then make him dig his own grave before I killed him too!”\n     “You’re a fucking sadist man,” \nNick Fitz says, chuckling a bit at the ridiculousness of what the man had said, at how well adept barflys and drunks are at spinning yarns.\n In Mervs the walls tell the secrets, the aged beer signs and ancient light bulbs that management no longer even bothers covering. The walls with the half century old paint job, chipped and decaying, that seems to seep out the scent of ancient cigarette smoke, of poison and fear. Mervs doesn't even have shelves visible to store it’s liquor, so most everything is bottom shelf, except the good scotch that the owner kept most likely because it was his personal poison, his brand of drinking swill. Other than that Merv’s is well known for attracting the kind of desperate fools who buy the lottery tickets—cash only of course—that keep this hole in the wall from disappearing into a memory. Protecting Mervyn’s from being prettied up and made to look nice for the new residents of the town. The kind of residents with a perverted view of northern California gleaned from Hollywood,not reality. The kind that plants palm trees in the yard of their awkwardly red roofed, ugly, spanish style, pocket mansions.\nHe sat, sipping his gentlemen's Laphroaig, and while tasting the woody oak and smoky aroma that defines great scotch, pondering the days events.\nThere was the women who had tried to extort pain medicine from him, she had been a good story teller as well, able to “remember” all the right details for him to type into his machine that she so associated with her own personal drug highs. Drug addicts can spin a yarn. Parents know how to bullshit their way through just about anything too, Children were not near as clumsy as their parents seem to continually claim to him they were. Parents always know what to say to him to type into his little machine, they all know what to say. \n    He sat alone in his thoughts in the dark bar, surrounded by others alone in their own dark thoughts. Sipping poison to numb the pain and take that edge of pent up anger and resentment off. Staring absentmindedly at some other cities sports team batting, or throwing, or hitting—for more money than most men at the bar could even conceive of— sipping and cheering rhythmically to their younger heroes trials and tribulations Just trying to be normal in their own heads and in their own way. With every sip of the booze, washing away the days events, cleansing of the worries and pain of the hospital and dissolving of the emotional toll of all and of his own overactive imagination. Lifting off the weight of worried mothers, fathers, brothers, husbands, and wives, that so heavily rested upon the huge Physician Assistants shoulders at the end of nearly every shift.\nHe pauses, running his fingers through his short Minnesota blonde crew cut and stares into the bottom of his high ball glass as if looking for an answer to some question he didn’t quite know how to ask, wondering how many others had done the same with this same glass.\n     “So what do you even do Nick? I see you in here about every week day now around 530.”\n Another barfly, on his right, a little bit older, and maybe just a little bit kinder asks.\n     “I’m a physician assistant, I work at Valley Med’s ED. I’m on day shift now so I work 9-5 and I just come here for a drink or two before going home, before I have to deal with my wife and all, you know how it is.”\n Nick answers, trying his best to be complete and thorough as to not invite any more questions, twiddling his thumbs as if the conversation was unwanted attention, detracting from his own processing of the days events. He wriggles with discomfort on the old worn bar stool, worn by the asses of thousands of denim jeans.\nThe barfly nods at him, with understanding, or more likely frustration with his own significant other. \n     He thinks to himself about what she would think if she knew he was here, not at the hospital still doing paper work as he would so often lie. His eyes are tired and red, memories imprinted that were still being processed completely, as new ones continued the assault on sanity. He raises his hand when the heavy set and elderly bartender looks over at him.\n     “What’ll you have?” he queries.\n     “Laphroaig, Neat.” Nick answers\nHe goes to the liquor cabinet that sits just out of view of the restless alcoholics, near limping up to the door to serve Nick’s drink. \n     “So Nick,”The bartender says, seemingly popping out of nowhere to serve his customer the drink, “I heard you were in the Army, where did you serve?” \nHe looks at Nick as if examining and judging him, as if he was looking for an answer to some sort of hidden question to be satisfied.\n     “I was at Fort Knox for a while, as a Physician Assistant, I was then a PA for an infantry battalion in Eastern Afghanistan, but I was a grunt before that, in 03’ during the invasion,”\n Nick says, letting him know of his experience as a grunt last, to prove a point, a point he didn’t quite understand or necessarily need.\n        “Ah, I was in the infantry back in Korea,” He says, with some amount of pride in his eyes, as if it was a high point in his life. Nick knew the feeling and longed for the times of his near youth as well. In his memory the young strapping 18 year old kid headed to war for the very first time, the life of the party, the immature idiot, was a far cry from who he saw himself as now.\n         “Thank you for your service sir.”Nick said respectfully, shaking the man's hand as the man returned the words.\n        “Thank you for your service,” And he continued on back to serving a few of the working class mexican patrons who were drinking beer and carousing in the corner, having a good old time. Good for them Nick thought to himself. But then he thought back to Afghanistan and how it had all started there.\nEvery week at the beginning of deployment he would skype his wife, and every week he would say less, and less, as the horrors of what he was seeing separated their realities divisively until he rarely called home at all.\n     “It’s not that I don’t love you, it’s just that I’m having trouble feeling anything”\nhe remembered saying, and the words even stung him. That was over now and when he had returned he had eventually opened up again, and they were good for a few years. He didn’t have to sleep on the couch anymore, they had sex every night, everything was going great! \nBut he was still haunted by memories, and didn’t want to share for fear of burdening his wife. But as he was dealing with old memories, his profession of medicine never failed to provide new traumas to cope with, and as it piled on he just felt like going and getting a drink before going home. I mean where was the crime in that? His phone rings, illuminating the old picture of his unit he sets as his background. A text message.\n     “Hey Babe are you gonna be home soon?” \nIt reads, from his wife. Maybe she missed him he thought to himself, maybe she wanted to be with him right now, maybe the cloudy weather had her thinking of him.  She was at her most affectionate at times like these, a woman who enjoyed nothing more than the cold and the rain, any excuse to stay indoors with a book; to feel the warmth of her husbands body beside her under the warm comforter of their queen sized bed.\n     “I’ll be home in about 45 minutes, just finishing up some paperwork at the hospital.”\n He lies, instinctively.\nAs the lie sets in, on top of all the other lies, well intentioned lies albeit but lies all the same. His handsome boyish face—a face that hardly represented his real age of 33 going on 88— wrinkling and shifting with worry and stress. He begins to feel dirty, to hate himself. Only two drinks in though, there's still turning back as he throws the monster off his back, getting up immediately and leaving the bar to walk nextdoor to the flower stand to buy some white Azaleas, her favorite flower and his go to in crisis. On the way he passes Los charros, the taqueria untouched by time, with old murals and cheesy Chicano culture, save the new flat screen tv,simplify endeared it to is and it was the place where they had had sporadically met for lunch so often. He remembered her words.\n\"What are you thinking about?\" She had asked? What had been thinking about? Perhaps it was the patterned burns that so tortured that 7 year olds legs he had seen earlier, the one with the story telling parents. The boiling pot fell. Bullshit.\n\"Nothing honey, just dazing.\" He said lazily, offering an easier solution to her, shirking their responsibility to one another.\n\"Really?\" She queried, prodding for some more information, pushing him to open up. But the walls were still up, and he wouldn't lend her his vulnerability.\n\"Yeh honey, I'm ok.\" He said, locking the door on his feelings. And he really did feel ok. She placed her hands on his hands and looked him in the eyes lovingly, trying to imbue strength and caring. Their eyes met and she appeared shocked, stunned by the emptiness in his, perhaps shocked by the despair and tortured nature of it all. There it was her fear.\n“15.50,”\n The flower clerk says, handing him his cut flowers. Flowers, what a god damn racket he thought to himself as he handed her so much of his hourly wages.\n\tThe alley reeks of piss as he walks through it, territorial markings of hundreds of animalistic drunks.  Getting in his car he thinks about what he’s going to say, as he rolls down the window to let in fresh air. The cold fall air is crisp and breathable; cold air that had travelled over the ocean, past the lazy beach towns of the coast and over the Santa Cruz Mountains across highways, and sleepy little rural communities once occupied by the now nearly extinct ohlone tribe, settling as a fog in morning over the water, and making it’s way inland to drape itself like a cold blanket over the peninsular city.\n“Honey I love you I’m...fuck what do i say...fuck, Ok. Honey I love you and I’m sorry for lying, I just cant. Fuck I can’t deal with you after work without having a drink first? No, no that sounds horrible you evil bastard. Ok, I’m sorry, I fucked up, I’ve been having a drink after work every day, and lying that I was at work. I know it’s stupid, I’m not opening up to you enough, I’m sorry.”\nMaybe that will work he thinks to himself. He’d rather just be honest and get it out at this point then try and plan and maybe manipulate, just tell the whole truth.\nThe trees whizz by on either side of the road as his old brown chevy blazer—with the busted tail light and brown peeling finish— flies into the quiet and picturesque suburban, sputtering, and coughing up smog. The neighborhood is right near downtown Mountain View, tiny little homes for new couples and single google employees, right near Merv’s. On the way he passes a car accident at an intersection, the red and white lights pierce through the darkness, casting ominous shadows as the rescue workers worked on getting a passenger out of a smashed up car.\n     He pulls up to their tiny two Bedroom house, with blue wooden paneling glossed like an after thought over cheap stucco walls, with white four pane windows and ugly maroon blinds that he had picked foolishly for their price one time without asking his wife. A Red \nLifted truck sits in the driveway, in brilliant arrogance.\n    He gasps, sighing deep like a man with a bullet in his chest, and puts his hand to his head for a moment, as if in some sort of incredible pain, and then the training kicks in, the separation of emotion from thinking, —the lobotomy of compassion for self—his face overcome with the arrogance of apathy.\nHe turns around to return to Mervs, for his own safety, the echoes of a thousand puzzled therapists echoed in his head.\n     “Just walk away.”\nDriving back to the bar, he passes the car accident. The red lights are still their flashing, the police have arrived too. He notices the— unmistakable to him— form of a blanket covered corpse. Sitting alone and unattended in its place behind the rescue truck. At the sight of the corpse, there he is again, pulling the sheet over the face of another dead child, to shield others from the shock of such a sight. The tears come now, streaming down his face;there was no guilt, crying over a dead child. He completes his drive to the bar and sits with the other lonely barflys on those aged and torn up barstools.  The white azaleas sit in the passengers seat of the bronco, alone.\n\n",

    "passage": "[SF] WIP Short Story Idea: Futuristic Airborne Soldier\n\nThis is my first attempt at writing so please keep that in mind. Any and all feedback is welcome. Just so you have an idea what this story is about, its set roughly around the year 2080. Russia has been building up its military silently while the Western European nations, along with the U.S. are busy dealing with issues in Korea and other parts of the world. In a blitzkrieg attack, the Russians capture cities along their Western border before many nations can even figure out what has happened. The United States, along with other nations like the U.K. and Germany quickly react and send their \"Airborne\" forces to slow the advance of the Russian forces into Europe. At this point in history, space travel had become more of the norm to a degree that colonies and bases had been established on the moon and on Mars. The ships, like the Myrimidon, are essentially HTOL (Horizontal Take Off and Landing) that are able to hover for short periods of time. I like to imagine something much larger than the Pelican from Halo when I think about them. Traditional Airborne units have been for the most part, removed, and replaced with this new age technology of incorporating high altitude wing suits capable of launching from a stable platform from the Mesosphere. Advances in Anti-Air weaponry has essentially forced jumps from this altitude, where the weaponry isn't as effective. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!\n\nSkipping along the upper reaches of Earth’s Mesosphere in preparation for the initial drop, the Assault Transport Ship Myrimidon creaked and moaned under the immense pressures bearing down on the exterior hull. The ship had begun its initial approach over the drop zone. The steady muffled hum of the crafts eight SABER engines lulled me into a relaxed state. Having already taken my airsickness medication, and beginning my high-altitude breathing techniques, my heart began to race at the sheer notion of what was about to occur. This would be my first combat jump. Historically though, this would be the first large scale Mesospheric combat jump in history. The technology behind mastering jumps such as these had only recently been refined, at least to a degree that the military deemed it a reliable means of inserting troops into combat. Accidents still occurred, but for the most part, it was safe. At least that’s what I told myself as I was jostled around in my seat aboard the Myrimidon.\n\nIn an effort to ease my nerves I reached into the front pocket of my harness to get a stick of gum. Already wearing my heavy thermal gloves, it became a monumental task to retrieve a stick. I don’t know why, but fumbling with such a simple task started to make my heart race even faster than it had already been. A tinge of panic began to set in as I was unable to do even the simplest of things. I just wanted a damn piece of gum. As I freed the stubborn stick from the pocket, the contents poured out in front of me on the main walkway down the center of the corridor. My platoon sergeant, Albrecht Morrison, whom we affectionately called “Legs” due in part to the fact that he had lost both in the Korean War some twenty years prior. Since then, after multiple surgeries, and advancements in prosthetics, “Legs” had been given a new lease on life and outfitted with the latest bionic tech. Since the advancement of bionic tech, many disabled veterans had been outfitted and were finally able to get their lives back. Some of which, like “Legs” in this case, had a warriors spirit and wanted to get back into the fight. After all those years of watching events unfold all over the globe and feeling utterly useless, he could finally do something to make a difference. “Legs” was a warrior through and through. He was part of the core that made up the “Old-breed”, veterans of Korea and Turkey. Veterans of that era were a hot commodity in a modern military where most had never seen combat. Sure there had been peacekeeping operations and some limited engagements in Africa following the wars in Korea and Turkey, but never anything on this scale.\n\nLegs made his way over to my seat, bracing himself due to the vibrations by gripping the bar that ran down the center of the corridor. He bent over and picked up some of the contents that had spilling out onto the floor. Some insta coffee packs I always liked to swipe from the chow hall, a small data player that I had placed some music onto, and then something I had almost forgotten was even in the pocket. Something I didn't want to think about. A picture of my wife folded in half and wrapped in a weather proof bag. Legs couldn't tell what it was that he had just handed me, but he could tell it stopped me in my tracks. Grinning, he looked down and mouthed “You’re gonna be alright kid”, there was no sense in saying it aloud, we hadn't turned on our comms units yet and the noise from the ship drowned everything out, almost everything. Thoughts were something that just couldn't be silenced. Legs made his way down the corridor, and left me with the immense weight that picture placed upon my heart. Never before had I been that scared in my entire life.\n\nAs I sat there, fighting my fears and contemplating life, I almost didn’t notice the subtle red glow that had begun to fill the bay as the pilot turned on the warning lights one by one. Bathed in the dark shroud of the warning lights, It began to sink it. This was happening. It wasn’t a training operation. This would be a combat jump. Legs began to make his way up and down the bay again, but now, with a stone cold expression. He made his way down the rows of soldiers deftly inspecting rigging, comms units, weapons, and palm thrusters, paying no attention to the person actually inside the suits he was checking. It wasn’t that he didn’t care for us, it was that this was his job. To keep us alive, and this was the best way he knew how, by ensuring our equipment worked when we needed it. The rest was up to us. There would be no helping us once we stepped off into thin air and began our supersonic descent towards the ground.\n\nOnce Legs had finished his checks, he took up his position at the back of the ship. At this point, all eyes were on legs. He signaled the hand motion to turn on our comms units by placing his right index and middle finger to his right ear. I thumbed the comms selector to the open position and could instantly hear the other forty-eight solders on board attempting to establish a steady breathing rhythm, some better than others. Over the wash of labored breathing filling our comms, Legs shouted “STAND UP!” Once on our feet, the soldiers began a practiced ritual of inspecting the gear of the soldier in front of them. After a brief moment to allow this task to be completed, Legs then yelled “SOUND OFF!” Starting at the back of the craft, the soldiers began to count off with their respective number, and “okay” to signify that they had all of their equipment and were ready to jump. The steady and methodical countdown began “Forty-six okay, forty-five okay, forty-four okay”… I was twenty third in line, and had begun to let my mind wander.\n\nThe prevailing thought that muffled the count filling my ears was “What was Beth doing right now?” I tried not to think of her, tried not to think of the promises I made her. That I would make it home to her and we could finally start a family. That didn’t seem even remotely likely now as I stood in a ship careening through the Earth’s atmosphere headed into hell. While I attempted to fight back the imagery of her lying on our couch in the living room busily typing away, responding to fan mail and publishers regarding her recent book, the steady hum of the ships engines interrupted by quick bursts of chatter brought me back to reality. “Twenty five okay, twenty four okay, TWENTY THREE OKAY…” I barely recognized that I had even counted off my own number. I guess practice makes perfect. The count continued for a few more moments until it reached Legs, our number one position. “ONE OKAY!” He shouted.\n\nSilence filled the bay as our eyes collectively focused on the large illuminated red bar that spanned the width of the back of the ship. Not allowing my mind to be consumed by thoughts of home again, I turned my focus to the task at hand. I began doing one final glance over my gear. At this point my helmets visor had been dropped and locked into position, making it difficult to look down at my chest rig. I ensured that my rifle was still strapped to my left leg, and that my assault pack was firmly in place. I bent over slightly to be able to see under my assault pack, in between my legs to ensure that the webbing of my wing suit was zipped and laid out properly. While doing these checks, I was able to see that my winglets under my arms were in fact zipped and in place. Upon completing a quick glance over of my gear, my eyes resumed the ever watchful gaze upon the glowing red light.\n\nMoments later, I could feel immense vibrations throughout the craft as it shuddered to a hover, the engine nacelles pivoting into the vertical position. Once stable, it would be mere seconds before we were out the door. A heavy roar filled the bay as the engines fought to keep the ship aloft, long enough for us to make the jump. A series of lights and alarms began to go off throughout the bay as the air locks at the back of the ship opened, releasing the door. In that brief moment, even twenty two soldiers back in line, I could see the Earth before me. The pronounced curvature was something I had been astonished by in my earlier training jumps. So peaceful, the serene silence of it all. That peaceful serene silence would be abruptly shattered. \n\nThe rear ramp dropped and without a moment to gather my thoughts, soldiers were running down the ramp and into nothingness. Legs was the first one out of the ship, yelling “LETS GO BOYS!” as he cleared the ramp and disappeared into open sky. The rest of us began a steady jog towards the ramp as one by one, soldiers jumped out of the ship following Legs’ example. As we neared the edge, I began to notice other ships in the sky, hundreds of them, hovering like baskets, spilling their contents down unto Earth. Steady streams of what looked like black dots poured from the surrounding vessels. Reaching the edge of the ramp, I closed my eyes and leaped from the Myrimidon. At first it felt as if I was weightless, like I might float out into space. Air, although incredibly thin at this altitude surged by me, ensuring that I was in fact falling, and fast. I immediately established a steady diving position, locking my arms and legs so that the drift ratio of my wing suit would be maximized. We were eighty kilometers up, and forty kilometers from our target.",

    "passage": "Arran Lee-Barrett\n\nARRAN LEE-BARRETT (born 28 February 1984) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.\n\nHe made his senior debut for Cardiff City in 2004. After two years at Cardiff he signed for Weymouth where he spent another two years before joining Coventry City in 2007. He did not make an appearance for Coventry, joining Hartlepool United following the end of his short term contract. He spent two seasons at Hartlepool before joining Ipswich Town in 2009. He spent four years at Ipswich. Following his release from Ipswich he had short spells at Millwall at Bolton Wanderers during the 2013–14 season.\n\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\n\nWhen he was 10, Lee-Barrett joined his local club Whitton Sports Centre and took the position of goalkeeper.[1] Shortly after he was offered a place at Ipswich Town's academy where he played alongside later-England international Darren Bent.[2]\n\nAfter leaving Ipswich he was offered an apprenticeship at Fulham and Norwich, he chose Norwich as he preferred the atmosphere there.[3] However, he failed to break into the reserve team and was second choice reserve keeper behind future England international Robert Green.[4] He was released by Norwich and had a trial at Chelsea.\n\nCardiff City\n\nHe was offered a one-year contract with Cardiff after impressing during a trial and was coached by George Wood.[5] He spent most of his time at Cardiff as third choice keeper, mainly playing for the reserves. While playing for the reserves Lee-Barrett helped Cardiff win the Pontins Holiday Combination.[6] Cardiff manager Lennie Lawrence decided to release the young keeper believing that he was better off getting games.[7][8]\n\nWeymouth\n\nTorquay, Doncaster and Shrewsbury all showed an interest in Lee-Barrett.[9] Although he trained with Torquay,[10] he moved to Weymouth due to the offer of first team football.[11][12] He made 19 league appearances and 2 appearances in the FA Cup, helping Weymouth to win the Nationwide Conference South.[13]\n\nCoventry City\n\nIn January 2007, Lee-Barrett signed for Coventry City on loan as emergency cover for Luke Steele due to the injury of other Coventry keeper Andy Marshall.[14] After his loan spell he signed permanently after being offered a temporary contract.[15] However at the end of the season he was not offered a new contract and was released after failing to break into the first team. After releasing Lee-Barrett, Coventry City manager Iain Dowie revealed that he was impressed with his “attitude and professionalism” and wished him all the best.[16]\n\nHartlepool United\n\nShortly after Lee-Barrett was signed by Hartlepool after being recommended by Hartlepool's goalkeeping coach George Wood who had previously coached him at Cardiff.[17] For his first season at Hartlepool he was given the number 21 shirt.[18] On his debut Lee-Barrett performed well against Newcastle, making some impressive saves and keeping a clean sheet in the half that he played.[19][20]\n\nAfter playing Harlepool's first game of the season, a 2–1 loss to Luton Town, he was dropped, with Danny Wilson picking Jan Budtz over him for the Pools next fixtures. He was released from his contract on 6 May 2009 after being deemed surplus to requirements.[21]\n\nIpswich Town\n\nOn 21 August 2009, it was announced that Lee-Barrett had signed for the Championship team Ipswich Town, on a short-term deal.[22] This came a day after Shane Supple had retired from the game aged 22. Lee-Barrett covered first-choice goalkeeper Richard Wright and was included in the squad that travelled to West Brom the next day.[23] He made his debut for Ipswich on 29 November against Cardiff City, coming off the bench in the 25th minute for the injured Richard Wright. Ipswich won the game 2–1. Following that game, Ipswich enquired into the possibility of bringing in a keeper on loan to replace Wright, despite the loan window not being open. This request was denied, leaving Lee-Barrett and Ian McLoughlin, the youth team goalkeeper, as the only two goalkeepers on professional contracts at the club. Ipswich's next game was away at Bristol City where Lee-Barrett kept a clean sheet. In January 2010, Lee-Barrett was rewarded with a new 18-month contract at Ipswich.[24] He was offered a further contract extension in April 2011.[25]\n\nMillwall\n\nOn 16 August 2013, he made the move to Millwall covering for Stephen Bywater and Andy Marshall after David Forde had picked up an injury. He did not make a first team appearance whilst with the Lions but did act as an unused substitute for Steve Lomas' team.[26]\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nOn 24 October 2013, he signed a short-term contract with Bolton Wanderers to provide competition for Andy Lonergan after both Ádám Bogdán and Jay Lynch had been ruled out of action with knee and back injuries respectively.[27] He linked up again with his former manager Lennie Lawrence, an assistant manager to Dougie Freedman at Bolton. He later signed a contract extension until the end of the season. Following the conclusion of the season, Bolton Wanderers offered Lee-Barrett a new one-year deal but on 1 July, Bolton confirmed that he had left the club.[28]\n\n\nInternational career\n\nWhile at Weymouth Lee-Barrett was selected for the England National Game team, which consisted of England's best non-league players and made his debut for them against the Netherlands in November 2006.[29]\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n  Club                Season               League             FA Cup   League Cup   Other   Total\n  ------------------- -------------------- ------------------ -------- ------------ ------- ------- ------ ------- ------- ------- ---- ---\n  Division            Apps                 Goals              Apps     Goals        Apps    Goals\n  Cardiff City        2003–04[30]          First Division     1        0            0       0\n  2004–05[31]         First Division       0                  0        0            0       0\n  Total               1                    0                  0        0            0       0\n  Weymouth            2005–06[32]          Conference South   0        0            0       0\n  2006–07[33]         Conference Premier   19                 0        2            0       0\n  Total               19                   0                  2        0            0       0\n  Coventry City       2006–07[34]          Championship       0        0            0       0\n  Hartlepool United   2007–08[35]          League One         18       0            0       0\n  2008–09[37]         League One           37                 0        5            0       3\n  Total               55                   0                  5        0            3       0\n  Ipswich Town        2009–10[39]          Championship       13       0            2       0\n  2010–11[40]         Championship         7                  0        0            0       0\n  2011–12[41]         Championship         18                 0        1            0       1\n  2012–13[42]         Championship         0                  0        0            0       0\n  Total               38                   0                  3        0            1       0\n  Millwall            2013–14[43]          Championship       0        0            0       0\n  Bolton Wanderers    2013–14[44]          Championship       0        0            0       0\n  Career total        113                  0                  10       0            4       0\n\n  : Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] Arran Back At Town .

It aired on November 14, 2007.[1]\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe fourth grade girls have made a secret list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest. When the boys steal the list, they are completely unprepared to deal with the results.\n\n\nPlot\n\nWhile some of the fourth grade boys are eating lunch in the Cafeteria, a troubled Butters dashes up to them telling them about a list. He exclaims how the girls have made a list which rates the boys from cutest to ugliest. As a result, everyone begins to argue over who would be the hottest. In the corridor, Eric Cartman demands Bebe to give them the list. Bebe explains that the list is held by the list keeper, Nelly, and that the boys can never see it- then proceeding to blow a raspberry and storm off. Cartman in turn blows a raspberry back and flips her off hatefully. With Bebe gone, the boys are left to do everything themselves.\n\nIn his basement, Cartman devises a plan (\"Operation Cannot Possibly Fail\") to get the list. However, the plan ends as a failure and the boys were forced to fall back. Back in his basement once more, Cartman sets up for his next plan (\"Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time\"). This time, Kenny McCormick will jump in front of Nelly and spit on the ground when she leaves the cafeteria for recess.\n\nThe plan is a success as Kenny, Cartman, Butters, and Craig Tucker dash down the hallway with the list waving in Kenny's hand. The other boys pursue the four of them who are then pursued by the now incredibly angered girls. They go into the boys' bathroom in order to avoid them and tape the list to the wall. The boys then view the list, with the order from first to last being:\n\n-   Clyde\n-   Token\n-   Stan\n-   Bradley\n-   Jason\n-   Leroy\n-   Kenny\n-   Tweek\n-   Kevin\n-   Jimmy\n-   Butters\n-   Craig\n-   Timmy\n-   Francis\n-   Cartman\n-   Kyle\n\nCartman is quick to mention that Kyle is at the bottom, allowing Kyle to look at the list while Eric taunts him. Kyle, who was previously indifferent about the list and peoples' opinions overall, stood alone in the bathroom- slowly becoming very self-aware about his appearance.\n\nAfter school, Butters runs to his home and tells his mother and father he is 11th on the girls' list. His father replies, \"Good for you!\" and states that they won't have to ground him. \n\nMeanwhile, as Kyle eats his dinner with his family, his mother questions him on his somber mood- to which Kyle explains about the list. Sheila deems it ridiculous, claiming he has his father's, Gerald Broflovski's, appearance; his father then stating he has his mother's nose. Kyle, gets up horrified, and leaves the table shouting \"the least you could've done is told me!\". Trying to get to sleep, Kyle is disrupted by Cartman who appears at his window boasting of being more attractive. Kyle draws his blind and tries to get to sleep. Clyde, meanwhile is in his bedroom, and after his mother leaves the room telling him to go to bed, he poses, trying to look attractive.\n\nIn the corridor, Clyde walks along greeting the girls. Kyle is still upset, and Clyde tells him that Abraham Lincoln was ugly but he accomplished a lot. Clyde walks off, telling Butters that he can't help his looks. Cartman walks up to Kyle and tells him that he believes he should hang around with the ugly kids so he won't \"stand out as much\". Kyle sits with The Ugly Kids at lunch, all of which are incredibly hideous with odd traits, which makes him stand out even more than before. Kyle sits with them outside as well. After one of them explains he hates school and would like to burn it down, Kyle gets an idea: they need a makeover. He soon changes his mind after attempting to makeover a girl with huge glasses and a huge nose. He then takes his place back on the step.\n\nDiscovering that Kyle has become dejected, Stan goes to Wendy and asks if they could talk. As they walk off, Lola questions if he'll ask her to come back. Wendy comments that it is a nice surprise, seeing as she thought he never wanted to talk to her again. Stan says he wants to ask her about the list, saying it's messed Kyle up and questions how she could vote Kyle ugliest. Wendy says she didn't, she voted for Cartman. Stan states it wasn't unanimous and that maybe she could change the list which she refuses as it's not just fun, there's protocol. Stan asks if they can ask the girls why they voted Kyle ugliest, which Wendy informs him won't be easy but she will try and get him in their next list-making meeting.\n\nIn their meeting hall, the girls are holding a meeting. Bebe is in charge, with Lola and a black haired girl as the next in charge. The girls discuss who has the cutest purse, then Wendy questions if they can open the previous week's list. Stan then asks about it but Bebe says no list is made hastily. Wendy states he is was only asking for it to be opened for debate. Bebe however says that she can't by \"Sparkle Law\", open it.\n\nKyle lies in bed flicking a lighter on and off, planning to burn the school down. Suddenly, the ghost of Abraham Lincoln appears and takes him on a journey around town. He shows him that attractive people are cursed because when they know they are attractive, they don't have to work to be special and become nothing when they reach age 40. Meanwhile, kids like Kyle's ugly friend Yamal work hard for the respect that the attractive automatically get, and because of that he will have character which is something those who are attractive rarely get. Kyle explains he does not want to wait until he is an adult to be happy.\n\nAt Wendy's house, Wendy discovers some of the girls gave Clyde a rating of one sparkle, which Stan adds he has no idea what she is talking about. Wendy tells him Rebecca could have made a mistake when tallying the votes onto the final list. Wendy then pays a visit to Rebecca, but as Wendy explains her theory, something in Rebecca snapped. She warns Wendy to keep out because she's getting close to a secret she can't handle and tells Wendy to let it go. And with that, she backs into her door and disappears. Shocked at realizing this, Stan remarks that it didn't sparkle with her.\n\nAt True Value, Kyle is buying the things he needs to burn down the school.\n\nReturning to the meeting hall, Wendy shows Lola and Jenny a report she has made which shows no-one voted Clyde the cutest. Lola informs Wendy that Clyde's father owns a shoe shop and that now the list has been altered and he is popular, girls can date him and get free shoes. Wendy threatens to tell Bebe about this, but Bebe was the one who altered it and is currently dating Clyde. Wendy then says she'll tell the other girls, but Jenny Simons questions if the girls will believe her over the heads of the committee and that they will make a new list; biggest liars - and put Wendy right at the top. Lola tells Wendy to do herself a favor and keep her little mouth shut. Wendy then kicks Lola in her crotch and runs off with Stan.\n\nStan then asks Yamal where Kyle is, who informs him that he is at the school putting it into the brink of ignition.\n\nArriving just in time, Stan and Wendy tell Kyle the list was forged. A traitorous Bebe then points a gun at Wendy telling her all about how great the shoes she has are, which Wendy becomes temporarily mesmerized by. Wendy snaps back and informs Bebe she's contacted the police and told them all about the scandal. Bebe believes Wendy to be lying, but is shocked to hear police sirens as they arrive telling Bebe to surrender. With Bebe distracted, Wendy wrestles with her to get the gun. Suddenly, a bullet is fired. Stan cries out to Wendy who removes her hand from her breast, but there is no wound. Bebe removes her hand from her stomach, but once again there is no wound. The two of them stare around, wondering where the bullet went. Kenny is ready to eat dinner with his family, when a bullet comes through the window into the back of his head. As his face hits the table, the Pop-Tarts shoot out of the toaster and his family stares in shock.\n\nThe police arrest Bebe, and it's unknown what happened to her after this. Stan tells Kyle he can finally see his true position on the list. Wendy then burns the list on Kyle's request, for he does not want to know his rating and Abraham Lincoln was right. Wendy tells Stan its been great hanging out with him again, and that he seems to have changed. Stan says things do change, and Wendy walks towards him and he does the same, but suddenly he comes over queasy and pukes over her continuously.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.  \n\n    ↑ \"The List (Season 11, Episode 14) - Episode Guide\". southparkstudios.com.\n\n  --- ------------------ -------\n      1114: \"THE LIST\"    edit\n  --- ------------------ -------\n\nSTORY ELEMENTS\nThe Ugly Kids • The 'Real' List • Operation Cannot Possibly Fail • Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time\n\nMEDIA\nImages • Script • Watch Episode\n\nRELEASE\nSouth Park: The Complete Eleventh Season\n",

    "passage": "Peter Löscher\n\nPETER LÖSCHER (born 17 September 1957 in Villach, Austria) is an Austrian manager and former president, Global Human Health at global pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. He was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) of Siemens on 20 May 2007 as the successor of Klaus Kleinfeld, and was selected to take on the new position on 1 July 2007.[1] As of 2017, Löscher remains as the only CEO to be hired from outside the conglomerate in the 170-year history of Siemens.[2]\n\n\nEarly life and education\n\nPeter Löscher graduated from Gymnasium Villach/Austria in 1978 and got a master's degree at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration. Later he attended but did not obtain a degree from an MBA program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and attended the six-week Advanced Management Program (AMP) at Harvard Business School. In 2007 he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering from Michigan State University.[3]\n\n\nCareer\n\n[The President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Peter Löscher in 2010.] [Peter Löscher, President and CEO of Siemens, with Maria Bartiromo, the television journalist, at the FT CNBC Davos Nightcap, 26th January 2012.] From 1988 until 2000 he worked for the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst in Spain, Japan, Great Britain and the United States. After Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc he stayed at Aventis until 2002.[4] He then joined Amersham, which was taken over by General Electric. In 2006 he became a member of the executive board of the US pharmaceutical company Merck[5].\n\nLöscher became the first CEO of Siemens AG to be appointed from outside the company in 2007.[6] Under Löscher, Siemens spun off its Osram lighting unit and sold its half of a joint venture with Nokia that supplied equipment for mobile telecommunication networks.[7] In 2012, he earned 8.7 million euros.[8] In late 2012, he initiated efforts to save 6 billion euros ($7.7 billion) over the following two years.[9]\n\nIn his capacity as CEO, he accompanied Chancellor Angela Merkel on various state visits, including to China in 2012.[10]\n\nFollowing a series of missteps under his leadership, including a late delivery of high-speed ICE trains for German national railroad Deutsche Bahn and delays in completing offshore wind turbine projects,[11] he was replaced by Joe Kaeser (Josef Käser) as CEO and left Siemens in July 2013,[12] four years before the end of his contract.[13]\n\nUnder the terms of his pay-off of 17 million euros from Siemens,[14] Löscher was obliged not to work for a “significant competitor” of the company until September 2015. In 2014, he was hired by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg to serve as chief executive of Renova Management (RMAG), which oversees his international industrial holdings, including stakes in Sulzer and in Oerlikon.[15] He left Renova in 2016, amid disagreements with Vekselberg.[16]\n\nIn Munich, Löscher shares an office with Ann-Kristin Achleitner, Paul Achleitner, Michael Diekmann and Joachim Faber.[17]\n\n\nOther activities\n\nCorporate boards\n\n-   Salesforce, Member of the Advisory Board on Europe, the Middle East and Africa (since 2020)[18][19]\n-   Philips, Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2020)[20]\n-   Telefónica Germany, Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2020)[21][22]\n-   Doha Venture Capital, Member of the Board of Directors\n-   Telefónica, Independent Member of the Board of Directors (since 2016)[23]\n-   Sulzer, Chairman of the Board of Directors (since 2014)[24]\n-   TBG AG, Member of the Board of Directors (since 2013)[25]\n-   OMV, Chair of the Supervisory Board (2016-2019)[26][27]\n-   Deutsche Bank, Member of the European Advisory Board (2011),[28] Member of the Supervisory Board (2012-2017)[29]\n-   Munich Re, Member of the Supevisory Board (2009-2014)[30][31]\n\nNon-profit organizations\n\n-   Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business (APA), Chairman (2010-2014)\n-   Siemens Stiftung, Chairman of the Board of Trustees (2008-2014)\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nLöscher speaks German, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese.[32] He and his Spanish-born wife have three children.

    "passage": "Stanislav Petrov, a lieutenant-colonel in the military intelligence section of the Soviet Union's secret service, reluctantly eased himself into the commander's seat in the underground early warning bunker south of Moscow.\n\nIt should have been his night off but another officer had gone sick and he had been summoned at the last minute.\n\nBefore him were screens showing photographs of underground missile silos in the Midwest prairies of America, relayed from spy satellites in the sky.\n\nHe and his men watched and listened on headphones for any sign of movement - anything unusual that might suggest the U.S. was launching a nuclear attack.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR MORE\n\n[]\n\nThis was the height of the Cold War between the USSR and the U.S. Both sides packed a formidable punch - hundreds of rockets and thousands of nuclear warheads capable of reducing the other to rubble.\n\nIt was a game of nerves, of bluff and counterbluff. Who would fire first? Would the other have the chance to retaliate?\n\nThe flying time of an inter-continental ballistic missile, from the U.S. to the USSR, and vice-versa, was around 12 minutes. If the Cold War were ever to go 'hot', seconds could make the difference between life and death.\n\nEverything would hinge on snap decisions. For now, though, as far as Petrov was concerned, more hinged on just getting through another boring night in which nothing ever happened.\n\nExcept then, suddenly, it did. A warning light flashed up, screaming red letters on a white background - 'LAUNCH. LAUNCH'. Deafening sirens wailed. The computer was telling him that the U.S. had just gone to war.\n\nThe blood drained from his face. He broke out in a cold sweat. But he kept his nerve. The computer had detected missiles being fired but the hazy screens were showing nothing untoward at all, no tell-tale flash of an missile roaring out of its silo into the sky. Could this be a computer glitch rather than Armageddon?\n\nInstead of calling an alert that within minutes would have had Soviet missiles launched in a retaliatory strike, Petrov decided to wait.\n\nThe warning light flashed again - a second missile was, apparently, in the air. And then a third. Now the computer had stepped up the warning: 'Missile attack imminent!'\n\nBut this did not make sense. The computer had supposedly detected three, no, now it was four, and then five rockets, but the numbers were still peculiarly small. It was a basic tenet of Cold War strategy that, if one side ever did make a preemptive strike, it would do so with a mass launch, an overwhelming force, not this dribble.\n\nPetrov stuck to his common-sense reasoning. This had to be a mistake.\n\nWhat if it wasn't? What if the holocaust the world had feared ever since the first nuclear bombs dropped on Japan in 1945, was actually happening before his very eyes - and he was doing nothing about it?\n\nHe would soon know. For the next ten minutes, Petrov sweated, counting down the missile time to Moscow. But there was no bright flash, no explosion 150 times greater than Hiroshima. Instead, the sirens stopped blaring and the warning lights went off.\n\nThe alert on September 26th, 1983 had been a false one. Later, it was discovered that what the satellite's sensors had picked up and interpreted as missiles in flight was nothing more than high-altitude clouds.\n\nPetrov's cool head had saved the world.\n\nHe got little thanks. He was relieved of his duties, sidelined, then quietly pensioned off. His experience that night was an extreme embarrassment to the Soviet Union.\n\nPetrov may have prevented allout nuclear war but at the cost of exposing the inadequacies of Moscow's much vaunted earlywarning shield.\n\nInstead of feeling relieved, his masters in the Kremlin were more afraid than ever. They sank into a state of paranoia, fearful that in Washington, Ronald Reagan was planning a first-strike that would wipe them off the face of the earth.\n\nThe year was 1983 and - as a history documentary in a primetime slot on Channel 4 next weekend vividly shows - the next six weeks would be the most dangerous the world has ever experienced.\n\nThat the U. S. and the Soviet Union had been on the brink of world war in 1962, when John Kennedy and Nikita Krushchev went head-to-head over missiles in Cuba, is well known. Those events were played out in public. The 1983 crisis went on behind closed doors, in a world of spies and secrets.\n\nA quarter of a century later, the gnarled old veterans of the KGB, the Soviet Union's secret service, and their smoother counterparts from the CIA, the U.S. equivalent, have come out from the shadows to reveal the full story of what happened. And a chilling one it is. From their different perspectives, they knew the seriousness of the situation.\n\n'We were ready for the Third World War,' said Captain Viktor Tkachenko, who commanded a Soviet missile base at the time. 'If the U.S. started it.'\n\nRobert Gates - then the CIA's deputy director of intelligence, later its head and now defence secretary in George Bush's government - recalled: 'We may have been on the brink of war and not known it.'\n\nThat year, 1983, the rest of the world was getting on with its business, unaware of the disaster it could be facing.\n\nMargaret Thatcher won a second term as Prime Minister but her heir-apparent, Cecil Parkinson, had to resign after admitting fathering his secretary's love child. Two young firebrand socialists, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, were elected MPs for the first time.\n\nPolice were counting the dead bodies in serial killer Dennis Nilsen's North London flat, the Brinks-Mat bandits got away with £25million in gold bullion and 'Hitler's diary' was unearthed before being exposed as a forgery.\n\nEngland's footballers failed to qualify for the European finals.\n\nThe song everyone was humming was Sting's Every Breath You Take - 'Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.' It was unwittingly appropriate as that was precisely what, on the international stage, the Russians and Americans were doing.\n\nOn both sides there were new, more powerful and more efficient machines to deliver destruction. The Soviets had rolled out their SS-20s, missiles on mobile launch pads, easy to hide and almost impossible to detect.\n\nMeanwhile, the Americans were moving Pershing II ballistic missiles into Western Europe, as a direct counter to a possible invasion by the armies of the Warsaw Pact (as the Soviet Union and its satellites behind the Iron Curtain were known).\n\nThey were also deploying ground-hugging cruise missiles, designed to get under radar defences without being detected.\n\nThen Reagan, successor at the White House to Jimmy Carter, upped the ante in a provocative speech in which he denounced the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire'.\n\nHis belligerence rattled the new Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, a hardline communist and former head of the KGB whose naturally suspicious nature was made worse by serious illness. For much of the ensuing crisis he was in a hospital bed hooked to a dialysis machine.\n\nHis belief that Reagan was up to something was reinforced when the President announced the start of his 'Star Wars' project - a system costing trillions of dollars to defend the U.S. from enemy ICBMs ( Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) by shooting them down in space before they re-entered earth's atmosphere.\n\nHe saw this as an entirely defensive measure, but to the Russians it was aggressive in intent. They saw it as a threat to destroy their weapons one by one and leave the USSR defenceless.\n\nEven more convinced of Washington's evil intentions, Andropov stepped up Operation RYAN, during which KGB agents around the world were instructed to send back any and every piece of information they could find that might add to the 'evidence' that the U.S. was planning a nuclear strike.\n\nIn the Soviet Union's London embassy, Oleg Gordievsky, a KGB officer masquerading as a diplomat, was ordered to watch out for signs of the British secretly stockpiling food, petrol and blood plasma.\n\nIn the KGB's Lubyanka headquarters, every small detail was chalked up on a board, filling it with words until the mountain of 'evidence' appeared overwhelming. But the problem was, as a U.S. observer noted, that the KGB, while strong on gathering information, was hopeless in analysing it.\n\nIn reality, what it was compiling was the dodgiest of all dossiers, in which the 'circle of intelligence' remained a dangerously closed one. Not for the last time in matters of war, the foolhardiness of fitting facts to a preconceived agenda were exposed.\n\nEast-West tension increased when an unauthorised aircraft flew into Soviet air space in the Bering Sea, ignoring all radio communications. Su-14 intercept fighters were scrambled to shoot it down in the belief that it was a U.S. spy plane.\n\nIt turned out to be a civilian flight of Korean Airlines, KA-007, that had strayed off course en route from Alaska to Seoul.\n\nAll 269 passengers and crew died. Reagan denounced the 'evil Empire' again, and Moscow detected once again the drumbeats of war.\n\nAND THEN came the event that nearly triggered catastrophe. On November 2, 1983, Nato - the U.S.-led alliance of western forces - began a routine ten-day exercise codenamed Operation Able Archer to test its military communications in the event of war.\n\nThe 'narrative' of the exercise was a Soviet invasion with conventional weapons, which the West would be unable to stop.\n\nIts climax would be a simulated release of nuclear missiles. Command posts and nuclear bases were on full alert, but, as the Soviets were repeatedly told, no actual weapons were involved.\n\nThe words 'EXERCISE ONLY' screamed out from every message. But the Soviet leadership, with its eye on Reagan's supposed recklessness, chose not to believe them. Andropov, in his sick bed, and his Kremlin advisers were gripped not just by current paranoias but by past ones.\n\nThey were the World War II generation, forever conscious of how Hitler had fooled Stalin and launched his savage Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in 1940 under the pretext of an exercise.\n\nIn the war that followed, 25million Soviet citizens died and the Motherland came close to caving in. To allow history to repeat itself would be unforgivable.\n\nNow, the Kremlin watched and listened in horror as the West went though this drill. Top priority 'flash telegrams' went to Gordievsky and others in KGB stations around the world demanding 'evidence' that this exercise was a disguise for a real nuclear first-strike.\n\nIn Washington, the effect that Able Archer was having on the Soviet leadership was completely missed. In fact, rather than winding up for a war, Reagan was doing the opposite.\n\nAt Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, he had recently had a private screening of a made-fortelevision film called The Day After, which was a fictional reconstruction of the aftermath of nuclear war.\n\nThe former Hollywood cowboy was more affected by this than by any military briefings he might have had. The film predicted 150 million dead. In his diary he wrote: 'It left me greatly depressed. We have to do all we can to see there is never a nuclear war.'\n\nThe old war horse was changing course and soon he would begin to make overtures to Moscow that would lead to his first visit there, a building up of relationships and an easing of East-West tensions.\n\nHe very nearly did not get the chance. As Able Archer wound up to its climax, so too did the Kremlin's paranoia. In the Nato exercise, Western forces were on the brink of firing a theoretical salvo of 350 nuclear missiles.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the military went on to their equivalent of the U.S. defence forces' DefCon 1, the final warning of an imminent attack and the last stage before pressing the button for an all to real massive retaliation.\n\nOn airfields, Soviet nuclear bomber pilots sat in their cockpits, engines turning, waiting for orders to fly. Three hundred ICBMs were prepared for firing and 75 mobile SS-20s hurriedly moved to hidden locations.\n\nSurface ships of the Soviet navy dashed for cover, anchoring beneath cliffs in the Baltic, while its submarines with their arsenals of nuclear missiles slipped beneath the Arctic ice and cleared decks for action.\n\nWHAT saved the situation were two spies, one on each side. Gordievsky, the KGB man in London, was really a double agent working for British Intelligence. He warned MI5 and the CIA that Able Archer had put Soviet leaders in a dangerous frame of mind.\n\nIt was the first inkling the West had had that the exercise was being viewed with such panic, and the Americans responded instantly by down-grading it. Reagan then made a very visible journey out of the country as a signal to the Soviets that he was otherwise engaged.\n\nMeanwhile, an East German spy, Topaz - real name Rainer Rupp - had infiltrated the Nato hierarchy at a high level and was privy to many of its secrets, was asked by Moscow urgently to confirm that the West was about to go to war.\n\nDeeply embedded Topaz would know for sure, and all he had to do was dial a certain number on his telephone to confirm his master's fears. His finger stayed off the buttons. His message back was that Nato was planning no such thing.\n\nMoscow took a step back from the brink its own fevered imagination had created. At the same time, Able Archer reached its end, the simulation over, the personnel involved stood down. The date was November 11 - Armistice Day.\n\nOnly later did the West grasp how close the world had come to apocalypse. Reagan and his advisers were shocked, and more impetus was put behind finding ways to end the arms race with the Soviet Union.\n\nThe near-miss of 1983 has long been known by historians of the Cold War. But this documentary will bring it to a wider audience.\n\nToday, the West's relations with post-communist Russia and its aggressive leader, Vladimir Putin, are strained. Bombers and spy planes nudge rival air space, testing nerves, just as they did in the early 1980s. The situation is ripe for misunderstandings.\n\nThose events, 24 years ago, are also a reminder that, for all the concerns about global warning, mankind's greatest danger may still be its vast nuclear arsenals.\n\nIt has largely gone unnoticed that this year, with increasing fears of proliferation, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock up to five minutes to midnight, closer to nuclear catastrophe than at almost any time since the phoney war of 1983.\n\n_1983: The Brink Of Apocalypse is on Channel 4 on Saturday January 5, at_\n\n_7.30pm._\n",
    "question": "What does the article say about the Soviet Union during the Cold War?",
    "answer_human": "The Soviet Union's leader was the former head of KGB Yuri Andropov, who was paranoid about a pre-emptive nuclear attack by the US. His and his advisors' fears were heightened after discovering the technical faults of their early warning system. These fears reached a peak when the western forces started a military exercise simulating a Russian attack, the Able Archer. The paranoia was fueled by the memories of an attack launched by Nazi Germany under the pretense of exercise. As the Able Archer drills took place, the Soviets came to the brink of releasing nuclear missiles. During that time, KGB agents were assembling a dossier containing whatever scant evidence they could find about an imminent nuclear attack by the US as well, mostly fitting what they saw to their fears.",

    "passage": "Hawaiian hoary bat\n\nThe HAWAIIAN HOARY BAT (_Aeorestes semotus_[1]), also known as _ŌPEAPEA_, is a species of bat endemic to the islands of Hawaii.[2][3] Whereas the mainland hoary bat is found throughout North and South America, the Hawaiian hoary bat is distributed only among the major volcanic islands of Hawaii, making it the only extant and native terrestrial mammal in the state.[4] The Hawaiian hoary bat was officially named the state land mammal of Hawaii in 2015.[5] It is a federally listed endangered taxon of the United States.[6]\n\nLike many species of bats, Hawaiian hoary bats are brown in color. However they are distinguished by the silver coloration that ‘frosts’ the fur on their back, ears, and neck.[7] They typically weigh between 14 to 18 g (0.49 to 0.63 ounces), and have a wingspan of about 10.5 to 13.5 inches, with females being larger than males.[8] They are insectivorous, nocturnal, and forage and hunt using echolocation.[9] They are a solitary subspecies and roost individually rather than in colonies. They are found throughout a large range of different habitats - forests, agricultural fields, and areas populated with humans.[10] Due to their elusive and solitary nature, there is very limited knowledge on the ecology or life history of the bat. As of now, population sizes are unknown, which is problematic because this data is necessary for species recovery plans. Currently the Hawaiian hoary bat is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.[11]\n\nRegarding conservation, the Hawaiian hoary bat faces a number of possible threats including: habitat loss, collisions with man-made structures such as wind turbines and barbed wire, impact of pesticides on primary food source, predation and competition with invasive species, and roost disturbance and tree cover reduction.\n\n\nDescription\n\n[Hawaiian hoary bat with “frosty-hued fur”] The common name of the hoary bat was inspired by the hoary, or frosty, coloration of its coat. The Hawaiian hoary bat is distinguished by a silver tint along the brown fur of its back. More pronounced silver bands are found along the neck as the fur transitions to a yellowish brown along the face with the ears retaining a black edging around their perimeter. On average, these bats will weigh approximately and have a wingspan of approximately , making them one of the larger species of bats. There is a gender discrepancy in terms of size as females will typically be larger than males.[12] The Hawaiian name, _ōpeapea_ (“half-leaf”, also the shape of a traditional Hawaiian sail), refers to the outline of the bat's body, which is shaped like half a taro leaf.[13][14] [Depicts wingspan of the bat]\n\n\nEcology and behavior\n\nDiet\n\nThe Hawaiian hoary bat is a generalist insectivore.[15] An insectivore is a species that preys on insects for its source of food. A generalist is a species that preys on a wide variety of, in this case, insects. The bat’s main source of food consists of moths (Lepidoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera), but also includes crickets, mosquitoes, termites, and many other insects. The bat’s preference toward moths causes them to be attracted to light, which results in bat environments encroaching into towns. A high proportion of bats can also be found feeding in pastures, where beetles are abundant due to the high amounts of dung excreted by cattle. Since these bats are generalist hunters, they have been known to prey on both native and invasive insect species. This protects crops from pest infestations.[16]\n\nThe diet of the Hawaiian hoary bat can fluctuate depending on its environment. The bats mainly forage for food on the edges of clustered forests, in open pastures, or above the canopy. Within open environments, moths consist of a high majority of their diet. In cluttered environments, the diet is distributed more evenly across multiple insect species.\n\nSurveys indicate that the bat is opportunistic and can forage over many habitat types, including native and non-native vegetation and the open ocean.[17]\n\nThe Hawaiian hoary bat is a nocturnal hunter, usually hunting for food just before sunset and returning to its nest just before sunrise. Like other bats, they capture and eat their prey while still in flight. Bats do not have keen eyesight to spot their prey; rather, they use echolocation. By foraging using echolocation, the bats can catch their target while in flight. The bats’ flight patterns differ in accordance to the environment they are hunting in and the prey they are hunting. When hunting in open environments (i.e pastures or above the canopy) where larger prey is more abundant, they will fly faster with less maneuverability. When hunting in closed environments (i.e clustered forests) where smaller prey is more abundant, they will fly slower to allow for more maneuverability to catch their elusive prey. While foraging, bats can travel up to 12 miles in a night.[18] [Depiction of the mechanism of echolocation in bats]\n\nThe foraging activity of the Hawaiian hoary bat is most frequent on the islands of Hawaii, with additional activity on Kauai, Oahu, and Maui. No foraging activity is found on Molokai.[19]\n\nReproduction\n\nThe Hawaiian hoary bat follows a seasonal reproductive cycle. The pre-pregnancy months consist of November to April, after which breeding with a single mate occurs. The bats do not mate for life and will have a new mate each season. The pregnancy period begins in May and ends in June, when the lactation period begins. Fledglings are born at the end of August and will remain in the mother’s roosting nest until they become independent in 6 to 7 weeks. Mothers usually give birth to twins. This seasonal reproductive cycle causes a change in the habitat distribution of the bats. From pregnancy until fledgling birth, the bats will remain in lowland environments. As the mating season (and winter months) approaches, bats will move to highland environments. Changes in the habitat distribution of bats are linked to the energy abundance within an environment, influenced by temperature, rainfall, and food availability. While the bats are located on all the Hawaiian Islands, no breeding was observed on Niihau and Kahoolawe.[20]\n\nUnlike some bats, the Hawaiian hoary bat is a solitary species meaning that it roosts individually rather than in a colony. The bats will remember their roosts and foraging locations and return to them repeatedly. The bats prefer to roost in forest vegetation less than 4.5 meters (15 feet) tall (Hawaiian hoary bat Guidance for Renewable Wind Energy Proponents). These bats are usually find roosting in a multitude of plants consisting of: Metrosideros polymorpha (most common Hawaiian tree), coconut palms (_Cocos nucifera_), kukui (_Aleurites moluccana_), kiawe (_Prosopis pallida)_, avocado trees (_Persea americana_), shower trees (_Cassia javanica_), pukiawe (_Styphelia tameiameiae_), fern clumps, Eucalyptus, and Sugi pine (_Cryptomeria japonica_).[21]\n\nHabitat distribution\n\n[Bat netting the Hawaiian hoary bat] The habitat distribution of the Hawaiian hoary bat is observed by detecting the frequency of the bat’s echolocation using acoustic detectors, as well as through bat netting and insect collection (to track foraging data). The Hawaiian hoary bat is located on all the Hawaiian Islands, but does not breed on Niihau and Kahoolawe. The habitat of the bat encompasses a wide range of altitudes and location types. This habitat ranges from sea level all the way to 2,288 meters (or 7,500 feet). The bats are found in landscapes including human populated areas, forests, agricultural fields, pastures, and even near mountain summits (almost 4,000 meters or 13,000 feet). During the warmer months, bats will travel to lowland environments where they will be more active. During the colder months, the bats will travel to highland environments where they will not be as active.[22]\n\n\nLife history\n\nDue to their elusive and solitary nature, there is little research on the life history of the Hawaiian hoary bat. In 2005 it was estimated that population size ranged from a few hundred to a few thousand bats, but this was based on incomplete and inadequate data.[23] As of January 2020, population sizes and estimates are still unknown. The breeding season of the bat consists of the pregnancy stage, which occurs from May to June, and the lactation stage, which occurs from June to August.[24] Mating occurs from October to November.[25] According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, females often give birth to twins, as seen in the mainland hoary bat species.[26] Based on one study, the average number of pups per one female that survives to weaning is 1.8.[27]\n\n\nHistorical and present range\n\n_A.semotus_ occurs on all the major volcanic islands of Hawaii including Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, and Hawaii,[28] and that breeding populations have been noted in all except for Niihau and Kahoolawe.[29] The timing and origin of dispersal events of the Hawaiian hoary bat have not been studied in much detail. There is fossil evidence of the bats on the islands of Hawaii, Molokai, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai.[30]\n\nAccording to the 1988 Recovery Plan, the populations were thought to be largest on the islands of Kauaii and Hawaii.[31]\n\n\nConservation\n\n_Aeorestes cinereus_ (with _A. semotus_ listed as a subspecies) is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN.[32] Within the US, the Hawaiian hoary bat was first listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on October 13, 1970. An “endangered species” is any species or subspecies that is “in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.” The exact number of Hawaiian hoary bats was unknown, and the addition of the species to the list seems to have been precautionary.[33]\n\nThe United States Fish and Wildlife Service issued a recovery plan for the bat in 1988, with the goal of down-listing the bat from endangered to threatened status, and eventually to de-list it entirely.[34] Threats to the subspecies include deforestation and habitat loss, as well as indirect harm due to pesticide use.\n\nRecovery criteria of the 1988 plan include:\n\n-   determination of actual population status and habitat requirements\n-   populations on Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui are stable or increasing for at least 5 years.[35][36]\n\nIn 2009, a 5-year-review was initiated for 103 species in Hawaii, including the Hawaiian hoary bat. In 2011, a summary and evaluation of the 5-year review determined that, due to lack of data on population size and trends, the species could not be down-listed nor delisted.[37]\n\nIn 2018 another 5-year review was initiated, but no summary or evaluation has been posted.\n\nThreats\n\nThe Hawaiian hoary bat is a generalist distributed on all the major Hawaiian islands. Certain factors affect their population, almost all of which are anthropogenic. Biological factors, such as predation and competition, may affect the species but have not been studied at length at this time.\n\nThe largest contributor to bat mortality is collisions with man-made objects such as barbed wire fences, communication towers, and wind turbines.[38] Barbed wire fences are the leading cause of mortality. There are two proposed reasons that bats are attracted to wind turbines. The turbines may look like trees or the blades may resemble the flight pattern of another bat.[39] The state of Hawai’i has declared that by 2030, renewable energy will provide 70% of the state’s energy, and this will likely include an expansion of wind energy. This could increase the threat of wind energy, since more turbines could lead to more bat collisions.\n\nThe bats require treetops for roosting and thus habitat loss is a threat. With the clearing of trees for continued development in Hawaii, bats are unable to find places to reproduce. This is mainly caused by clearing for pastures, pineapple fields, and sugar cane farms. While they may use open areas to forage, not having enough pups will impact them. Tree trimming also affects new pups, as they may be unable to take flight.\n\nInsects account for a large part of their foraging diet. Because of this, the increased use of pesticides threatens to decrease insect populations. This is problematic because insects are a major part of the bats’ food supply. However, citric acid used on invasive _Eleutherodactylus_ frog species was found to be unlikely to have a negative effect on the bats.[40] Beyond this, the use of pesticides is not well understood and requires further investigation.\n\nRecordings from 1978 indicated that the bats may have been present on Kahoolawe Island, long devastated by bombing and the target of habitat restoration efforts.[41]\n\nCurrent conservation efforts\n\nThe largest contributor to the listing of the Hawaiian hoary bat as endangered is a lack of information on the species.[42] Specifically, its range and population are not very well known.\n\nA useful method of estimating the population is monitoring the bats' echolocation calls. Because this is the only known bat in Hawaii, any bat echolocation signals heard and recorded come from this subspecies,[43] and this monitoring method does not interfere with the animal.[44]\n\nAcoustic monitoring is being used for tracking the species and better defining its range. This type of information has been used both in academic and industry-funded research projects. For example, a study was commissioned by Auwahi Wind Energy to maintain their permit.[45] Gathering information will contribute to either down-listing the species or to further efforts to conserve it. Studies have been completed as recently as January 2020 in cooperation with the USGS.[46] [Scientist monitoring a Hawaiian hoary bat]\n\nIn January 2020, the Hawaiian hoary bat Guidance for Renewable Wind Energy Proponents was updated.[47] This document provides a framework for the development of Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs). Requirements for approval include minimizing bat death, determining impacts sufficiently, providing benefits to the species, and avoiding other specified impacts. It also states that the mitigation framework should be updated. This should happen, at a minimum, every five years. It also outlines recommendations in the following areas:\n\n-   Habitat restoration\n-   Land acquisition\n-   Research as mitigation\n-   In-lieu fee approaches\n\nNo current action for the Hawaiian hoary bat exists at the federal level. Generally, action is being taken at the state level involving many institutions including the University of Hawai’i.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] Frasher, H.

The Globe and Mail examines the foundation of Canada's historic real estate boom in a series._\n\nCanadian homes have rarely been as expensive as they are now.\n\nFor just the second time in the past century, the country's housing market is pushing the limits of affordability, according to key statistical measures, shutting many potential buyers out of the market, and making it harder for those who have already taken the plunge to pay off their mortgages.\n\nIn the past decade-and-a-half, house prices have accelerated at a rate that has outpaced increases in disposable income – though interest rates at historically low levels and a greater comfort level with debt helped mask the risks. Even the recent cooling in the housing market has so far been marked by a drop in the number of sales, with little downward movement in prices.\n\n\"There is no question that in Canada, we are in a real affordability crisis right now,\" said John Andrew, a professor in Queen's University's school of urban and regional planning.\n\nSince 2000, the price of houses across Canada has risen 127 per cent; nearly 50 per cent since 2006.\n\nIt's no surprise that housing is expensive, but there's no relief in sight. If anything, housing is likely to become even less affordable later this decade as interest rates return to more normal levels – unless there is a precipitous decline in real estate prices.\n\nA sharp spike in rates – like those seen in 1981 and 1990 – is unlikely. But even a small increase in rates will cause major pain for current homeowners saddled with record mortgage debt, larding on hundreds of dollars to monthly payments.\n\n\"There is going to be a very rude shock to the system once mortgage rates move up,\" said Prof. Andrew. \"Rates have been low for enough years that people have forgotten how unaffordable houses really are.\"\n\nA PERFECT STORM\n\nThe current run-up in house prices began in about 1997 and has continued almost unabated despite very small gains in income over the same period. Only once before in the last 100 years has there been a similar long-term shift, and that was back during the postwar years as returning veterans and a widespread housing shortage pushed prices up sharply in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nBefore that, prices had been very stable in the 1920s and 1930s. And from the 1950s to the late 1990s there was another long period of relative stability, punctuated only by a couple of brief mini-booms in the 1970s and 1980s that were followed by quick pull-backs in prices.\n\nThis time, a perfect storm of low interest rates, coupled with a relatively strong economy and Canadians' ever-growing willingness to pile on debt, prompted a nearly unprecedented run-up in prices. High immigration numbers and limited land for expansion in the country's largest cities have exacerbated the problem.\n\nHigh-school math teacher Nadine K. Mohammed, 32, always thought she'd own a house by now. \"I thought I'd go to university, get a really good job, save some money, and that would be the ticket to being able to afford a home. I was so excited,\" she said.\n\nInstead, the Toronto resident, who has been teaching for eight years, is renting the main floor of a bungalow in the west-end neighbourhood of Etobicoke with her husband. They save everything they can to put toward a down payment and hope to purchase a home in the next two to three years. \"But if prices continue to go up, I don't know if that's going to happen,\" Ms. Mohammed said. \"It's kind of a scary thought.\"\n\nThe couple also worries that when they're ready to buy a home in the city, it will be \"really tiny.\"\n\n\"As I've gotten older, I've realized I need to adjust my expectations and be more realistic,\" Ms. Mohammed added.\n\nWhile some of her friends managed to purchase their first homes when they were in their twenties, they were able to live rent-free with their parents to save money. \"Then voila, they had down payments,\" she said. \"Once you have to pay rent, saving takes a lot longer.\"\n\nBecause she knows mortgage rates will likely be higher by the time she and her husband buy a home, Ms. Mohammed figures they will take longer to pay off their mortgage than their friends who already own homes.\n\n'HOUSE POOR'\n\nRight now, just getting into the housing market is a huge challenge for many Canadians.\n\nThe average home in Canada now costs about $350,000, roughly five times the average household income. In the mid-1970s, it was three times average income, says University of British Columbia professor Paul Kershaw, who crunched the numbers for a recent report on generational income gaps.\n\nThere are many ways to judge how affordable a house is, but on that most basic measure – how many years of earnings it takes to buy a typical home – houses in Canada are dramatically more expensive than they were four or five decades ago.\n\nBuilding up enough cash for a down payment can be crippling for many people, Prof. Kershaw says.\n\n\"Take an average 25– to 34-year-old in 1976, working full-time and making the average wage. That person had to save for five years to build up a 20-per-cent down payment for an average home,\" he said. \"Today, take the same 25– to 34-year-old. Now, they have to save for 10 years. And in B.C., it is 15 years.\"\n\nThe underlying reason for this, Prof. Kershaw points out, is that housing prices have risen dramatically, while household incomes – adjusted for inflation – have barely moved at all since the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 2012, \"home ownership is so much more challenging,\" he said. \"And in urban settings, the home you are purchasing, as a younger person, is far less likely to have a yard. And if it does have a yard, it is because you are tolerating a far longer commute.\"\n\nThere are huge social implications in this shift, Prof. Kershaw argues. Young people are becoming resentful of those already in the housing market, and are subject to significant financial stress. Buying a house is getting out of reach, he said, even though it is \"a central part of the transition into adulthood.\"\n\nTwo decades ago, one in five Canadians bought homes with less than 25-per-cent down, the amount needed to avoid paying for mortgage insurance. Today, three-quarters of home buyers require insurance from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., though the government has lowered the threshold to 20 per cent.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada's respected Housing Affordability Measure underlines the impact of interest rates on housing costs. The index, which tracks the proportion of pre-tax household income required to pay principal and interest on a mortgage, along with property taxes and utilities, shows a huge spike in the early 1980s and again in the early 1990s, when interest rates jumped dramatically.\n\nSignificantly, however, the RBC chart also shows that ownership costs have tracked upward pretty much non-stop for the past decade, even as interest rates declined to the current rock-bottom levels.\n\nIn the Vancouver market, houses are far less affordable now than they were even during those earlier interest-rate spikes, the Royal Bank's figures show. The current ownership cost of an average two-storey house eats up close to 80 per cent of average household income. Elsewhere in the country, the average is closer to 50 per cent.\n\nA health-care worker in southwestern Ontario who didn't want his name used, said mortgage and child support payments make up roughly half of his take-home income, and that leaves very little for long-term investments such as RESP plans for his kids' education, or retirement savings. \"Any forward planning is really limited,\" he said. \"When you are living this way it feels precarious, and that is _with_ a great mortgage rate.\"\n\nThe big worry, he said, is what will happen if rates rise and his payments increase significantly. That could require a drastic lifestyle change such as renting out his basement or selling the house and renting. \"That weighs heavily on me,\" he said.\n\nProf. Andrew of Queen's said that for many years the generally accepted idea was that housing costs should eat up about one-third of household income. The RBC figures show that the reality today is far different. A range of 40 to 45 per cent is likely a sustainable number over the longer term, Prof. Andrew said, although even at that level \"it means that people are not going to have the disposable income to spend on other things, and that is not good for the economy. You want people to be able to spend on cars and trips and those kind of things, without necessarily borrowing against the value of their homes.\"\n\nHe also noted that people's attitudes have shifted significantly, and Canadians are far more willing to accept the fact that they will be \"house poor\" over the long term. Indeed, that appears to have been the motivation for federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty to tighten up mortgage lending rules this summer, to try to reduce levels of debt associated with home ownership.\n\nTHE DANGER IN DEBT\n\nCanadians weren't always so willing to pile on debt.\n\nBrian and Dency Sharkey became homeowners when they were in their twenties in the mid-1960s, but they were very cautious in buying a house that from today's perspective looks unbelievably affordable.\n\nThe couple paid $19,500 for their bungalow in the Ottawa suburb of Nepean, and their monthly mortgage payments amounted to $99. In fact, that was even less than the $115 they had been paying to rent a two-bedroom apartment.\n\nStill, even with two teachers' salaries adding up to about $6,000 a year, it was hard to meet the payments, Mr. Sharkey said. It was done through scrimping, not through further borrowing. \"My wife keeps reminding me about drinking powdered milk and that kind of stuff,\" he said.\n\nThings are different in 2012, and with so many people willing to take on large mortgages and burdensome monthly payments, the big risk is a spike in mortgage rates, or even a moderate rise. A significant number of mortgage loan defaults among homeowners could have a devastating effect on the economy.\n\nEssentially, low interest rates are magnifying the already considerable risks that first-time home-buyers are taking on when buying expensive properties, said Ben Rabidoux, an analyst with research firm M. Hanson Advisors.\n\n\"Having young Canadians jump into home ownership, with mortgages that are at income multiples we've never seen before, is exposing a broad section of the population to significant risk if we run into any sort of a recession or macro shock or interest-rate rise,\" he said. \"We are just staggeringly comfortable with debt here in Canada right now.\"\n\nExacerbating this issue, Mr. Rabidoux said, is that many young Canadians already have significant debts even before they take on a mortgage. They may owe money on credit cards, and many will still have student debts outstanding when they buy a house. \"Twenty or 30 years ago that was not the case.\"\n\nWith house prices now softening slightly in some markets, it is possible affordability will improve over the next few months, Mr. Rabidoux said. That would be healthy in the long term, and may eventually bring in new buyers who have been priced out of the market. But in the short term, our economy is so tied to the housing boom, and the construction jobs it generates, that a weakening housing market is \"backing policy-makers into a corner,\" he said. Politicians would like to see house prices decline to make them more affordable, yet they worry that any decline in home-building could dent an already weak economy.\n\n_With files from Claire Neary_\n\n_-----------_\n\nTHE PAYMENT PINCH\n\n_A look at how mortgage payments could change if rates go up:_\n\n$350,000 MORTGAGE\n\n$1,656.36: Monthly payments for a 25-year mortgage at a 3-per-cent rate\n\n$480: The increase in monthly payments at 5.5 per cent\n\n$795: The increase in monthly payments at 7 per cent.\n\n$500,000 MORTGAGE\n\n$2,366.23: Monthly payments for a 25-year mortgage at a 3-per-cent rate.\n\n$686: The increase in monthly payments at 5.5 per cent.\n\n$1,136: The increase in monthly payments at 7 per cent.\n\n_Source: CanEquity_\n",

    "passage": "I wrote this two years ago for a creative writing class.  My grade was good, but wanted to see what you guys thought.  Also, this is my first post, so tell me if I'm doing anything wrong.  Thanks!\n\nSo I wrote this two years ago for a creative writing class.  My grade was good, but I want to know what you guys think.  I'll have more if you like it.\n\nThe Shadowlands\n\nMy world is dark, my mind is broken.  Time flows endlessly like the sand under my feet.  \nI wandered here seeking death, only to find pain.  My memories are gone, my purpose is an end.  An end to this cursed life I now live.  The reason for my curse is long forgotten, and I wander through the shadows, damned to immortality.  My body, scarred and aging, has long since become a prison.  I journeyed here as a young man, leaving behind my wife, my son, my village.  Once wealthy, I now possess only my clothing, the tattered and cracking leather a facsimile of my skin.  This place holds no food, no water, and no shelter from the wind and the dust.\n\tThis is the Shadowlands, the Dark Sands, the Realm of The Damned.  A vast desert, full of coarse sand, howling wind, and eternal night.  No living creature prowls among the dunes, no plant sprouts from the sand.  The sky is as dry as the earth, offering no water to slake my thirst.  The only other inhabitants of this place are the dustlights.  Shining clouds of light, always in the distance, they are the one thing that gives me hope.  The hope is false, for those cursed lanterns of the desert are enchanting on sight, only to leave you in this horrible place when you get near.  Their magic is powerful, and no logic can exist in their presence.  The purest joy on sight, their cruel illusion fades once they disappear, leaving me to my crueler fate.\n\tI wandered here for weeks, years, maybe even decades.  Time has no passage here.  The moon always hovers directly above, a guide to no man.  I do not know how long I’ve wandered, only that my skin is withered and leathery upon my bones.  I’ve become an old man since I’ve come here, turned into a hermit by fate.  My throat stays parched, my stomach empty, my lungs fill with the dust of the desert.  Yet I cannot die.\n\tMy curse is cruel, my fate is torture.  What I’d give to return to my family, my beloved wife and son.  They have probably long forgotten the man who left them all those ages ago, in the past time.  Any memories that do remain would be of a man who abandoned them, walked out of their lives, surrendering them to the world.  I remember not their faces, their voices, not even their names.  I only remember that I loved them.\n\n********************\n\n\tI climb yet another dune in this endless sea of sand.  All I see are more dunes, even higher than the one underneath my feet.  In every direction they are taller, leaving me in their shadows no matter how high I climb.  I hold onto the hope that one day I’ll conquer the highest dunes, to see a world of life and light stretched out before me.  I dream of leaving their shadows, and casting my own shadow upon them.  This dream is weak, beaten out of me by time.  These sands, imbued with an ancient magic, always raise the landscape above me, keeping me in the shadow of giants.  The moon watches over like a cruel phantom, watching and judging, but not changing my fate.  Its power overcomes me; I sway in its pale light.  The world goes dark.\n\tI awake at the bottom of the dune, buried in sand.  How I wish that could be my final grave, the end to my merciless existence.  I stand up, watching the sand flow from the cracks in my skin, a macabre hourglass that tells no time.  The dunes tower over me, like mountains over a field mouse.  The moon watches on.\n\tAs I struggle upon the shifting sands of the next great hill, I feel elation.  With that elation comes a gnawing sense of dread.  The only source of happiness in this wicked place is the dustlights, those shining beacons of false hope.  I gaze upwards, and upon the crest of the dune, I see it.  Shimmering in the eternal night, it shines with a holy light, beckoning me closer.  I feel a new strength as I surge towards the shining sphere of fog.  I struggle to climb the dune, the sand giving away beneath my feet.  I summit the hill, looking up to see the dustlight upon the next.  Sprinting down the slope, I tumble.  Sand catches on my clothing and hair as I roll downhill.  I get back to my feet at the bottom, and begin to ascend towards the light.  I run, sand flying out behind me.  I can almost see the inner source of the light’s power; can almost see past the haze into its depths.  When I finally rise to the summit, the light is gone.  I’ve exerted myself beyond my capacities.  The shadows take me.\n\tI awake to darkness.  Not the dark of night, but the deep blackness of blindness.  I can see nothing.  The moon is gone, that heavenly judge of the damned.  I feel sand around me; feel the grit against my skin.  I have gone blind.  This seems like a sweet mercy, taking away the endless vistas of desert.  My blindness makes me immune to the dustlights, for without my sight, I cannot witness their power.  I would feel elation if this put an end to my fruitless efforts to die, if this was the veil of death.  But it is not so, for I can still feel the cool sand of the desert, the grains brushing against my cheek.  I begin to feel the hunger and thirst that I always feel, yet had been able to ignore for all this time.  I feel as though I’ll go mad without water, my throat burns as if I had taken a deep breath of smoke into my lungs.  My stomach feels as though it is eating me from within.  I scream out, pleading for mercy from this desert, from my curse, from the moon, that supreme ruler of the night.  I begin to cry, but not tears of water, for my body holds none.  I cry tears of blood.  I cannot see them, but I taste their salty, metallic taste as they run into my mouth.  This must surely be the end, I plead that it be the end.  I feel the fingers of madness take hold upon my mind.  Probing, squeezing, they penetrate deeper.  I surrender my consciousness to the pain.\n\tI awake to a thrilling elation, complete happiness filling my body.  I feel no pain, no sadness.  My hunger and thirst are gone, replaced by pure joy.  I laugh to the heavens, a high shriek of mania.  I open my eyes, and a bright light surrounds me.  I still lay upon the sand, but a shining dome covers me.  I sense that this dome is made of the dustlights, but my happiness will allow no negativity.  The light and joy are driving me mad, insane giggles pouring from my mouth like a waterfall.  I tear at my clothes, standing up and dancing around in this feeling.  Laughter flies from my mouth like birds spooked from a tree.  I feel a pressing around me, and the dome grows smaller.  I feel as though my mind will break from my body, my mania fleeing this prison.  I’m on the verge of madness.  With one last howl of insane joy, I collapse. \n\tI fall back to the sand, waiting for the phantoms of unconsciousness to cover me.  They do not come.  I lay upon the sand, staring at the light.  My body has collapsed, trapping me inside.  As I gaze upwards, the dome expands.  I can feel the happiness drain away, my sanity dripping back in.  The dome grows to gigantic proportions, an atmosphere of dustlights surrounding me.  I am lying there, unable to move, when it pierces me.\n\tA thin ray of light stabs through my heart like a burning sword.  More follow, threatening to rip apart my mind and body.  I feel their raw power invading my very being.  I start to feel new emotions, emotions not felt in this damned existence.  I feel proud, confident, comfortable, and safe.  Memories flood back into me.  I remember old acquaintances, friends and family.  I remember my home, my village.  I remember walking its streets, remember its name.  It was Carahil.  I remember walking through it in the autumn, arm in arm with my wife.  I remember her name.  Cecilia.  I remember her amber eyes, golden hair.  I can see her soft skin, her delicate features.  I remember my son, his eager eyes, and his excitement at learning of the many treasures of the world.  I remember his name.  His name was Samuel.  He was eight.  I remember the love I had for them; remember summer nights spent with them in the fields, watching the stars.  I remember that autumn, the autumn of my damnation.  The memories flood back.  I scream.\n\tI suddenly remember more, I remember that Cecilia was with child.  She was carrying what would be our second child.  She was hoping for a little girl, the daughter she always dreamed of.  She wanted to be a good mother, taking care of herself as she had with Samuel.  She stayed at home, at our beautiful house on the hill outside the village, while I went into town to do business.  It was a cool autumn day, and I had gone to buy food for the coming months.  I took our wagon, leaving Samuel to take care of his mother.  I spent around four hours bartering, conversing, and learning of the local news.  It was dusk when I headed home, the wagon creaking towards the sunset.  I arrived back home, led the horses back into their stalls, and stored the wagon.  I walked into the house to fetch Samuel to help me carry goods into the house.  The house was silent when I arrived.  I walked through the kitchen, calling their names.  I walked down the hallway, and still no answer.  Finally, I arrived at our bedroom.  In the middle of the bed, among the bloodstained sheets, lay Cecilia.  She was unconscious, the blood still wet.  \nI rushed to her side, attempted to wake her up.  She opened her eyes slightly, moved her mouth, but no words came out.  I rushed into the spare room, ripping off the fresh sheets, brought them to her.  I attempted to stop the bleeding.  Tears ran down my face.  As I attempted to bring her back, Samuel walked in.  He called out his mother’s name, announced his arrival.  I rushed into the hall, yelled at him to run to the village and fetch the doctor.  He questioned me as to why, and I roared for him to get a doctor.  He left, and I sat next to Cecilia, crying and praying.\n\tA few hours later the doctor steps quietly out of the bedroom, a somber look on his face.  He informs me that Cecilia will survive, but she is weak.  Our second child, however, is lost.  I let out a great sob, sliding down the wall, my head on my knees.  The doctor gives me instructions for her care and then departs.  Samuel is in his room sleeping, his run exhausted him.  I go into the kitchen, and pull a bottle from the shelf.  Gulping deeply, I feel the warm numbing sensation that I resisted for so long.  I promised Cecilia I would never drink once I was a father.  I broke that promise on that autumn night.\n\tAn hour later, the house is quiet and dark.  My body is numb from the alcohol, but my mind feels sharper.  Samuel, my beloved son, betrayed me.  I told him to watch over his mother, and he left to frolic in the woods and meadows.  We lost our second child because he left his mother to play.  I feel a deep rage, an uncontrollable anger.  I get up from the table, stumbling down the hall.  I approach his room and open the door.  He lies there sleeping, and I stagger to his bedside.  I stand over him, and then raise an open hand.  I bring it down on his peaceful face.  I strike him again, then again.  Three times total.  He never moves.  Then I lift him from the bed and throw him against the wall.  He lies there, motionless. I know that he is dead, can feel it in my blood.  I leave his room, walking to the next.  There lies Cecilia, my darling, my love.  I stand by her bedside, grasping the bottle left by the doctor.  In it lies a clear greenish liquid.  I uncork the bottle, jamming her mouth open and forcing the medicine down her throat.  I don’t want her to have to live with the death of her two children.  She wakes up, struggling weakly.  I hold her down, waiting for the stillness to come.  It does, and I stagger outside.  Kneeling on the grass, I curse the world, my son, my wife.  I curse the moon, that great observer, for not aiding me.  I sense it communicating with me, trying to pass a message.  I feel my mind go black.  My consciousness slips away.  \n\n********************\n\n\tI awake in the desert, the dustlights are gone.  The moon has returned.  I bleed from my mouth, my nose, my ears and my eyes.  Blood flowing, crimson life draining from me.  I lie there motionless, and then feel movement come back.  I stand, blood streaming down my skin.  I am not dying, I am perfectly conscious of the pain.  I look to the moon, and I know.  I know why I have been cursed, I know why I am not allowed to die, and I know why I am forced to wander these cursed wastes.  I know that my prior wanderings were merciful.  For now I know.  The knowledge of my deeds does not fade.  It is seared deep in my mind.  I know that I will live forever with this knowledge, with this guilt.  I know that I will wander in anguish through this desert, among these endless sand and dunes, for millennia.  I know the dustlights won’t return, that their purpose is fulfilled.  I know that this torture is eternal.  I know that I will live forever in the Shadowlands, the Dark Sands, the Realm of The Damned.  I know that I am cursed to immortality in the eternal night.\n\n\t\n",

    "passage": "[FN] I posted this to WP thread. I wrote far more than I expected to.\n\nThe prompt was \"When everyone turns 18 they receive a pet that is figurative of their personality. You're the first person to receive a dragon...\"\n\n“They keep calling me ‘Ghost Boy’” Joqur said, he found it hard to look into Chelsie’s eyes as he said it.\n\nBefore his Choosing Ceremony, staring into her eyes was a favorite pastime of his, albeit a covert one. Two years his elder, she always seemed to be there for him when he needed her. In a city the size of Gilead, her constant presence was truly a feat—the logistics of which he had not quite determined. \n\nIn part he refused to question out of fear. Ten years now they had been inseparable. Her touch, her eyes, and most of all her words had kept him going during the most trivial of trials and those more demanding. His most cherished memories of her were blurred kissed, shared under moonlight in the fields of the outer walls after drinking cheap root drink her and other students had stolen or smuggled for the New Year celebrations. \n\nYet, since her Choosing Ceremony two years and not a fortnight passed, she had changed. She was still there when he needed her, without question. Yet since receiving her Sea Eagle she spoke more and more of her travels to come; the lands she would explore, the new tongues, the colored people. These travels of course did not involve the studious Joqur—his travels were little else but through ink and parchment. To date, however, she had not left. \n\nAnd of course she spent time tending to her resonant. Sea Eagles were large creatures. Hers was the size of a man and the wingspan of four. Given time and special attention it was said even some could be ridden.\n\n“Joqur…” Chelsie reached over and gave him a soft pat on the shoulder and stared where his eyes should’ve been if his head weren’t downturned. After some time his eyes met hers. She gave a soft but strong smile.\n\n“Ghost boy because of all the 79 men of my day-of-birth this Choosing Ceremony I was the only one to receive no resonant whatsoever. They said my resonant must be a Ghost and he hides in the books I cling to.”\n\n“Joqur, please stop.” Her voice was gentle yet firm.\n\n“I’ve talked to my father as I told you I would. He says the records at the Changing Gate indicate that this has happened before. In the last Century a pair of twins didn’t receive their resonant at their Choosing Ceremony either. They had to wait a month for theirs to come.” \n\nChelsie lived not far from Joqur, though their families were of different report. His family walked to the second wall during the faming season and worked for their rice and roots. Chelsie’s father worked in the Great Temple and her mother ran a large Inn close to the Capital Building. \nChelsie’s voice rose in pitch as she saw some light pop back into Joqur’s eyes.      \n\n“Well it has been only three days. Maybe I’m like them then? My resonant has yet to come?” Joqur’s chest finally rose and he pulled his hands away from his face as he took a deep breath and offered a slight smile. \n\n“I think it could be.” Chelsie said smiling. She soon began to chuckle and this built in to a roaring laugh. \n\nJoqur’s laughter slowly joined with hers and rose in volume until they were both rolling on the floor in her parent’s sitting room as though they were youngins again. \n\nTheir laughter was harshly interrupted as Chelsie’s father abruptly entered the room. \n\n“Joqur? Well, I’m surprised to see you here… But relieved. I’ve been sent to find you” Joshua was tall, guant and regal. He too spent much time in books. After meeting Joqur by chance as a young boy he began paying for his schooling. He always assured Joqur that his mind was sharp as any and that no low-birth could dull the wit the gods had given him. \n\n“My parents must need help with the sorting at home, I’ll—“ \n\n“No Joqur, not your parents.” Joshua’s tone was clear, almost harsh. His normal quite demeanor was not to be seen.  \n\n“I’ve looked into your Choosing Ceremony. The water priests at the Great Gate have informed us that your resonant his here but we must leave immediately. There will be no time to invite your parents; no ceremony at all. This must be done now. I’d be happy to escort you to the Great Gate and be your witness.” \n\n“Father that’s great! I’m sure I could be his witness though, and I’m sure my company will be much more interesting than yours down the Central Canal. As if he needs a companion for the three minutes it will take to paddle there.” Chelsie shot her father a playful smile and nudged Joqur across the chin with her pinky finger.\n\n“Chelsie you are to stay here, you presence won’t be needed.” His eyes lacked their usual twinkle and his prose was uncharacteristically witless. \n\n“Father! I—“ \n\n“You. Shall. Stay.” \n\nJoqur finally spoke. “Chelsie don’t worry, you know I don’t mind being alone. This makes my Choosing Ceremony that much more fitting.” A sudden rigor filled Joqur and he quickly stood tall and met the gaze of Joshua. “Let us go Sir Joshua.” \n\nJoshua did little more than nod and they both left the room leaving \nChelsie still on the floor looking bewildered and hurt. They quickly walked out the back entrance and into their family ironwood boat. They each took an oar and began to stroke. \n\n“Joqur, we have not much time. You must know you will not have your ceremony in the Choosing Room. I will take you through a small channel underneath the Sept. You will have your ceremony at the Pool of the Night Willows.” \n\nThe Autumn breeze was strong, the splash of oars soft, and Joshua’s many adornments and jewels clanged the loudest, yet Joqur heard his heartbeat above all else.\n\n“I’m not a Priest… I, I, I don’t even go to the Sept as often as I should. \nI didn’t even make It there but once during the Reap Moon, maybe twice, I—“ \n\n“Joqur! Listen to me.” Joshua’s voice turned deep and sharp. His jaw set firm yet, the muscles of his temples bulged as he ground his teeth yet his eyes revealed sadness. \n\nIn the silence created by his outburst their boat passed from the sunlit canal into a darker passage closed off to the sky. Slowly they wound their way down into smaller and smaller passages. Joqur’s breath quickened as he struggled to keep pace with Joshua’s stroke set by his long lean arms. Each breath seemed to rip between their silence while Joshua’s seemed to struggle only in reserving tears. His movements and breaths were as smooth as ever.  \n\nFinally, after what seemed to be an eternity to Joqur, Joshua stopped rowing and pulled his oar in. He gestured to Joqur to do the same. They slowly drifted down the canal as Joshua pulled a large crystal from underneath his billowing cloths. Soon the dark passage was light with the light of an amber crystal, the shape  of which seemed to be shifting after each glance though the light was more constant than any torch or gnomic orb. \n\n“Joqur, I’ve loved you as a son and I always will.” \n\nTheir boat continued to drift at a constant pace though they had not pulled and oar for minutes. The tunnel they traveled through seemed to be more ancient by the minute yet the walls were free from any algae or marks of wear. \n\nJoshua stood abruptly and handed the amber crystal to Joqur. \n\n“I must leave you know. Be brave. I will tell your parents of your love and that you will see them again. Do not be afraid. You will pass a gate soon but the light from this gem shall open it for you. From there you will have precious moments to prepare for your ceremony. Use them.” Joshua finally looked at Joqur and smiled. His eyes twinkled in the amber light. His green eyes mixed with the red and produced a blue hue. He then leapt from the boat to the canal wall. \n\nJoqur’s head wiped around as he watched Joshua stick to the rounded surface of the canal with just one hand. His right hand, always jeweled, light up as it clung to the wall and the stones that held the wall together slowly moved to form stairs that he put his feet upon. With his free hand he raised his fist to his right temple and tapped it with his knuckles. The movement was dexterous as any but it looked odd as the farewell gesture was always completed with one’s right hand. Then he turned up the newly formed stairs and was gone. \n\nJoqur began to shake and realized he had worked up a cold sweat. He looked down at the crystal in his hand in fear of dropping it. What was once ephemeral was now not a crystal at all but a simple dark stone. In awe he started until he heard water rushing near him. As he looked up he saw a simple iron sewage gate swing open to allow his passage.\nThe movement shocked him and the rock fell from his grip yet it hovered in place. Joqur’s mind raced. \n\n‘Never in ANY of the Histories of Gilead have I read of any Choosing Ceremony leaving a man-formed-new alone against the world with no resonant. Men and women, kings and queens have gone berserk, wild, and mad at the death of their resonants in wars, lov,e and espionage. Why is it that I receive mine now and here in these dark tunnels under the Sept?’ \n\nJoqur’s thinking then shifted from that of words to the more primal thoughts of images and emotions as he looked at the stone in front of him and the eerily shadow-less light it cast all around him. Everything seemed to glow as if the stone gave the gift of light to each object but itself cast none. \n\nWhile lost in his mind the channel widened gradually and the ceilings grew taller and taller until they reached as high as the cone needles in the Silk Forest outside the final city gates. Then his boat stopped moving as it caught the root of the Night Willow.\nJoqur’s head rushed as he stared at the purple luminescent Night Willow. The pool beneath him was shallow and blue. \n\nBe brave…. Joshua’s words echoed in Joqur’s head yet fear kept him seated. The Night Willow was the most sacred of the Priestly Sanctuaries. He had never met anyone who had even seen a drawing of the Night Willow and he tried for years once he learned of its existence as a child. \n\nThe roots were woven together like those of his mother’s finest tapestries—her winter hobbies. The trees themselves reached as high and as far as his eyes could see beyond even the luminescence of the tress and the amber light of the stone. \n\nJoqur’s thoughts dissolved from logic and became fear; pure primal fear. Be brave. Be brave for what? Why must I be brave? I’m not brave. I’m brave with a pen, my figures, my arguments, my thoughts are brave. I can be brave for a moment or two, but no more. \n\nI’m not brave. It pulsed in Joqur’s head. \n\nI’m not brave. I’m not brave. I’M NOT BRAVE.\n\n“I’M NOT BRAVE!” Joqur shouted. The Night Willow all but swallowed his shouts. Yet when it did the amber light from the stone flickered and began to move. Once he realized it was moving away from him he swung to grasp for it yet just escaped his reach. The light began to dim as it traveled away from him, floating through the air.\n\nWithout thinking Joqur jumped from the boat to chase after the crystal. As soon as he began to chase after it he fell into the pool of knee-high water as his feet caught on a root. Fear surrounded him as he fell face first into the water.\n\nHe could NOT lose the stone. That he knew.\n\nHe quickly jumped up for air breathing water into his lungs as his did. Pain shocked his chest yet fear drove him forward. \n\nJoqur chased after the crystal in a high stepping manner to avoid the more perilous roots so as not to fall again. At times he reached up to low hanging branches to swing a few steps and others he ducked under branches grown too low and roots grown too high. No matter how hard he ran, jumped, and climbed he could not catch the crystal. It was always past his reach.\n\nJust as Joqur swore he could chase no longer without dropping from exhaustion his path became easier. The trees grew farther apart and his path grew wider. Yet with their scarcity so too diminished was the light. \nEventually the purple faded to a light glow and the path was clear. \nThe ground rose and so too the water disappeared. \n\nWithout warning the crystal stopped moving before him. He slowed his pace towards it and just as he reached out to grab it blue sparks erupted from the ground before him and the crystal vanished. Joqur found himself alone in the purple light barely able to see his hand in front of his face. Shocked, tired and sore he lay down, too tired to think or even fear. A light sleep almost took him within minutes but just as was about to give in to the comfort of the darkness a blue light caught his eye. Small at first yet it grew. \n\nAs the blueness grew he sat up and then stood. The blueness grew larger and closer. As it did it split into two blue orbs. Too tired to feel he stared, intrigued yet dumbfounded. Then, instantly it clicked; they were eyes and they were close. \n\nJoqur took a sharp breath and turned to run yet has he did a brilliant blue light burst forth into the air, shocks and lightning flew into the chamber above. His head seared as a deep humming vibrated in his head. The pain was so instant and overwhelming he could do naught but drop to the ground. \n\n‘I am dead’ Joqur thought. ‘This must be death. I am in the holiest of depths of the Sept chasing red lights, I must be dying and I must deserve it. Let it be quick.’ \n\nThe pain reached a feverish pitch and vibrated Joqur’s teeth, his very bones shook. And then, serendipitously, the humming receded enough so that his consciousness stayed. The humming pulsed, not just in his head now but his whole body. The pain receded further and further until it all but disappeared completely and his body held but a light hum. \n\nAs he opened his eyes he realized his surroundings were now blue entirely. As he looked up before him, not thirty steps away stood a beast on four legs with two terrible eyes the color of lightening during the raining days. Each leg was the height of the tallest man though not as thick and each claw the length of a short sword one would find on a common body guard. \n\nBefore fear could creep into his mind his now softly vibrating body pulsed and a calmness rushed over him. Fear still lingered but it seemed more foreign now. The beast opened its mouth, drew in a breath and the air cracked and lightly boomed through the giant Night Willow Chamber. The beast’s wings were each seven or eight times as long as it was tall. Its face had two small horns atop its head where light shocks bounced back and forth as did bones that seemed to run down its back and across the front of its wings. \n\nJoqur knew at once what he was gazing upon: the Mother of the Burnt Isles; the Shepard of the Sea Eagles; precursor to man; old as elves; as secretive as dwarves; as cunning as gnomes; as strong as treants; this was a dragon. \n\nIn his mind, thoughts, words, images and emotions fused as one. The message was clear as it pulsed through his being.\n\n“Joqur. There are lands other than these. Be brave. You are no Ghost Boy.”  \n",

It’s like you’ll miss it twice, once for the reflection, once for itself. A man is leaning over the bridge, contemplative. The bridge is bustling and honks are as common as laughs. Couples walk hand in hand and bicyclists fly past in their separate lane. An Asian family passes by the man. The mother leads the family, looking at her surroundings for threats against her children. A scowl painted on both of the parents faces; you can tell it’s been a stressful day. The first three members of the family of four walk past the man without skipping a beat, but a little boy with a short black mop on top of his head pulling up the rear stops to stare. The man turns to stare. For a few seconds they analyze each other, imaging life on the other side. “Kenji! Pali Pali!” The boy reaches into the pocket of his coat and pulls out a piece of chocolate. “Here, this’ll make you feel better; it’s what my Appa gives me when I’m sad.” The man smiles for the first time in what seems like his life and pats the child on his head as a worried mother grows an impatient look on her face. “Run along now”. \n\tThe sun’s golden lining disappears over the coast line leaving behind a dark purple afterglow. It’s one of those dawns that has the moon coming early to say goodbye to the sunlight- a full moon, he’s been waiting.  In what seems like minutes to the man, dawn turns to pure night and people file off of the bridge. Each car passing by has a more significant impact on the near silence of salty waves and the low whistle of the breeze. He wasn’t on Earth time anymore. Time is like a balloon- the more you fill it, the heavier it becomes. This particular balloon was filled with just the very basics: the night air, starlit darkness on a rippled reflection, and *thump*,*thump*. A new sound emerged- the sound of concrete being slapped by the sole of a boot. A Hispanic man, a stranger looking to be in his early 40’s emerges out of the darkness. Shaggy brown hair lies messily atop a wise looking face, empathetic grey eyes seem to stare into the man’s soul. The stranger stands maybe five feet from the man and leans over the hanging of the grey bridge. “Do you know what serendipity is?” asks the stranger. “Yeah… kinda”. “It’s like a happy accident”, the stranger explains. “Like tripping and finding a dollar?” “Yeah… kinda.” \n\tThe two men, one quite older than the other, stand side by side as if swallowed whole by the bright white gem. “Ya know, I saw you here last week, and again two nights ago” the stranger said. Silence responds. “Are you not sure about it? Or were you waiting for something?” The man looks at the stranger, then at the moon, gesturing with his chin. “I see”.\nThe stranger pulls out a flask. “Do you have something you can use as a cup?” he asks the man. The man looks down and thinks. He reaches in the inside of his coat and pulls out a mint container. “There’s some left, want any?” he asks the stranger. “I’m about to drink liquor”. \n“Oh… Right”, the man empties the mints into the bay. \n\tThe stranger pours the man a shots worth of amber, he asks, “What do we toast to?” “How about to the liquor?” “To the liquor!!” exclaimed the stranger as they tip their vessels together. Down the hatch the shots of gasoline go. “Ya know, I kinda hate whiskey but right now, this is all right” said the man. “It’s an acquired taste. Let’s get you on your way”. Two more shots poured, two more warm stomachs, two happy brains. *Braaaawaarooop*, the stranger lets out a devastating belch, the man responds with his own, less powerful, but nonetheless impressive, belch- the sounds of solidarity in the night. Two piss streams go into the bay. The darkest part of the night has already passed.\n\t“So what is it anyway?” the stranger turns and asks inquisitively. “What’s all gone so wrong?” \nThe man starred at his own two feet. “Where do you want me to start?” he looks down at the strangers’ feet.  “I’ve just moved to this city and my whole worlds back on the other side of the country probably falling in love without me. My family doesn’t give a damn about me and they don’t even notice I’m gone most of the night. The one thing that cared about me as much as I cared about it, my dog, was just put down for being a potential killer. My whole fucking life has been swept up from under my feet and now I’m having drinks with a stranger on a bridge well past midnight in a town I know nothing about...” the man sounded like he’d wrung out the last of the words he could manage for the moment. Turning with sparkly moonlit eyes and a manic kind of smile he asks, “So, how’s that?” The stranger looks back alarmed and sorry, “Listen I-*pop*…. *pop* *pop*.\n\t“Those sounded just like suppressed .45 rounds!” the man exclaims as they both turn to face the west entrance to the bridge. They start running, pounding against the steelwork. As they approach the entrance they see two shadowy figures running quite a distance away; turning into an abandoned side street. They were running from the scene they had left. The man and the stranger approached the first café adjacent to the bridge and found themselves in a horrific scene. A sprawl of spilled out purse objects: lipstick, lotto tickets, napkins, a cleaned out wallet. It was all fallen in a trail leading up to a woman’s hands-pale and relaxed. A pool of dark blood was collecting under her abdomen; a stream began flowing across covering her face down figure, dying the tips of her straight black hair. The blood was approaching her other hand which was clutched onto tight by a smaller hand.  A sudden rustle caught both men off guard and they turned to see a small child clutching his leg, a quiet terror erupting from his eyes. His mouth was open like he was screaming but hardly any sound could be heard. “Oh, fuck” said both men, one taking a step back, the other shocked frozen. This small boy, no older than 8 had a hole going through his entire left thigh, past the muscle and bone, and all the way through to the other side. The man kneels down and holds the boys hand, “Can you hear me? You’re going to be okay. We’re going to get help and you’re going to be okay.” The boy, still looking as if he was screaming, shook his head yes as tears glided across his face. “I don’t understand it, why can’t he speak?” asked the stranger. “He’s… he’s a- a mute.” said the man. “We’ve got to get him to a hospital, is there one close by?” “Only a block away on Grant” said the stranger “There’s a Sutter.” The man gently as possible placed one arm under the boy’s jeans, damp and warm from the blood and the other on the top of his back and lifted the boy up. “Let’s go”. “Wait. I need to call the police and wait for them here. You take the boy.” The man looked at the stranger firm in the eye and nodded, “Okay”. \n\tThe boy had been in the E.R. for three hours now. The sun had risen. The police had come to gather information. He had none for them. They told him the woman couldn’t be identified. There was nothing to go off of. They didn’t mention the stranger so neither did he. He starred at his own two feet and thought about if the boy would ever be able to walk again. It looked bad. He knew he didn’t have to stay. The operators room swung open and an older doctor came through, “You must be Jack?” he asked. “How is he?” “Well we were able to save the leg.” “Oh thank god” Jack said, exhaling relief. “But the boy is still in no condition to walk. It’s still too early to tell when that’ll approve but it’s safe to say he will recover.” “That’s such a relief doctor, thank you so much.” “I think if there’s someone that boy should be thanking, it’s you Jack. You know I bet he’s been wondering about you. I’d like him to rest some more but you can come visit him in an hour or so if you’d like.” “Thank you doctor.” \n\tJack went into the chair and slept for the first time in almost two days.\n\t“Hey”\nThe boy was lying in the hospital bed with a cotton leg and sad eyes that looked straight into and out of Jack. “I know this must be horrible for you.” The boy raised his arm and ushered Jack to come closer. The boy had something clutched in his hand. Jack approached him and raised his hand. The boy wrapped both hands around Jack’s hand and held on. Jack began to tear up as he felt something small and cold put into his hand. The boy closed Jack’s hand around the golden ring that had once belonged to his mother’s right hand. He had been holding it this whole time. ",

    "passage": "Anthony Sharp\n\n[Sharp in _A Clockwork Orange_ (1971)] DENNIS ANTHONY JOHN SHARP (16 June 1915, in Highgate, London, England – 23 July 1984, in London, England) was an English actor, writer and director.\n\n\nStage career\n\nAnthony Sharp was a graduate of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) and made his stage debut in February 1938 with HV Neilson's Shakespearean touring company, playing the Sergeant in _Macbeth_ at the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea. Repertory engagements in Wigan, Hastings, Peterborough and Liverpool were followed by war service, after which he resumed his stage career at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate in September 1946, playing Hansell in _Tangent_.\n\nHe first appeared in the West End in _Family Portrait_ at the Strand Theatre in February 1948. Among his many subsequent appearances were _Cry Liberty_ (Vaudeville Theatre 1950), _Who Goes There!_ (Vaudeville Theatre 1951), _For Better, For Worse_ (Comedy Theatre 1952), _Small Hotel_ (St Martin's Theatre 1955), _No Time for Sergeants_ (Her Majesty's Theatre 1956), _The Edwardians_ (Saville Theatre 1959), _She's Done It Again_ (Garrick Theatre 1969), _The Avengers_ (Prince of Wales Theatre 1971) and _Number One_ (Queen's Theatre 1984).\n\nOther London credits included _The Rivals_ (Sadler's Wells 1972), _She Stoops to Conquer_ (Lyric Hammersmith 1982) and several appearances at the Open Air Theatre Regent's Park. There he played Benedick in _Much Ado About Nothing_ in 1958 and Malvolio in _Twelfth Night_ the following year, rejoining the company in 1978 for such plays as _The Man of Destiny_.[1]\n\n\nWriter and director\n\nSharp was also a playwright. His stage version of the Thomas Love Peacock novel _Nightmare Abbey_ was a big hit at the Westminster Theatre in 1952, opening there on 27 February. “Anthony Sharp's altogether delightful adaptation provided one of the most unusual as well as most amusing offerings of the season,” commented _Theatre World_ editor Frances Stephens.[2] After a try-out in Sheffield, the historical drama _The Conscience of the King_ was remounted at the Theatre Royal Windsor, starting on 14 March 1955; Sharp himself played 17th century parliamentarian John Hampden.[3] A third play, _Tale of a Summer's Day_, was written in 1959.[4]\n\nIn addition Sharp was a prolific director, particularly of comedy-thrillers and 'boardroom' dramas. His credits included _Any Other Business_ (Westminster Theatre 1958), _Caught Napping_ (Piccadilly Theatre 1959), _Wolf's Clothing_ (Strand Theatre 1959), _Billy Bunter Flies East_ (Victoria Palace 1959), _The Gazebo_ (Savoy Theatre 1960), _Guilty Party_ (St Martin's Theatre 1961), _Critic's Choice_ (Vaudeville Theatre 1961), _Act of Violence_ (1962 UK tour), _Devil May Care_ (Strand Theatre 1963), _Difference of Opinion_ (Garrick Theatre 1963), _Hostile Witness_ (Haymarket Theatre 1964), _Wait Until Dark_ (Strand Theatre 1966), _Justice is a Woman_ (Vaudeville Theatre 1966) and _Harvey_ (1970 UK tour). He also directed several productions in Hong Kong and Australia.[5]\n\n\nCinema, television and radio\n\nCinema\n\nSharp was frequently cast as supercilious professional or aristocratic types, notably in the Stanley Kubrick films _A Clockwork Orange_ (as Minister of the Interior) and _Barry Lyndon_ (as Lord Hallam). Other film credits include Cornel Wilde's _No Blade of Grass_, two for Michael Winner (_The Jokers_ and _I'll Never Forget What's'isname_), Russ Meyer's _Black Snake_ and the Disney film _One of Our Dinosaurs is Missing_. His only starring role in a feature film was the homicidal priest Father Xavier Meldrum in Pete Walker's 1975 horror picture _House of Mortal Sin_.[6]\n\nHis final feature film, in which he played foreign secretary Lord Ambrose, was the James Bond picture _Never Say Never Again_, released in 1983.[7]\n\nTelevision\n\nIn 1977 he had a leading role in the children's television series _The Flockton Flyer_. Other TV dramas in which he appeared included _Angel Pavement_, _The Plane Makers_, _Doomwatch_, _The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes_, _Crown Court_, _Upstairs, Downstairs_, _Schalcken the Painter_ and _The Life and Times of David Lloyd George_. He also played numerous cameo parts in sitcoms, notably _Dad's Army_ (1969, 1977), _Steptoe and Son_ (three episodes, 1970–74), _Nearest and Dearest_ (1973), _Man About the House_ (1975), _Rising Damp_ (1975), _George & Mildred_ (1976, 1978) and _To the Manor Born_ (eight episodes, 1979–81). He worked frequently with such TV comedians as Benny Hill, Morecambe and Wise, Frankie Howerd and Bernie Winters, and towards the end of his life appeared in the early-1980s alternative comedy programmes _The Young Ones_ and _The Comic Strip_.\n\nRadio\n\nIn 1978, he appeared as both Garkbit, the waiter at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and The Great Prophet Zarquon, in Fit the Fifth of the original radio series of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.[8] In 1981, he appeared as the town clerk of the fictional Frambourne Town Council in the pilot episode of _It Sticks Out Half a Mile_, the radio sequel to _Dad's Army_; it was in that episode that Arthur Lowe reprised his role of Captain Mainwaring for the very last time several months before his death. In 1982–84 Sharp was a regular as Major Dyrenforth on the Radio 2 series _The Random Jottings of Hinge and Bracket_, his last few episodes being broadcast posthumously.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe was born Dennis Anthony John Sharp in Highgate in 1915 and was an insurance policy draughtsman before training as an actor. From 1940 to 1946 he served with the Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Artillery in North Africa, Italy and Austria. “Once the war was over,” he recalled, “I wangled a transfer to the Army Broadcasting Service and helped run radio stations at Naples and Rome. These were very full and very pleasant days—announcing, script-writing, disc-jockeying, organising programmes, producing, acting.”[9] He married the actress Margaret Wedlake in July 1953 and a son, Jonathan, was born in 1954. In _Who's Who in the Theatre_ he listed his favourite part as Malvolio and his recreations as church architecture and watching cricket.[10] He died of natural causes aged 69 in his native London; at the time of his death he was playing the Doctor in the West End production of Jean Anouilh's _Number One_ at the Queen's Theatre.[11]\n\n\nSelected filmography\n\n-   _Conspiracy in Tehran_ (1946)\n-   _The Sword and the Rose_ (1953) – French Diplomat\n-   _You Know What Sailors Are_ (1954) – Humphrey – Naval Attache (uncredited)\n-   _Wicked as They Come_ (1956)\n-   _The Man Who Wouldn't Talk_ (1958) – Baker\n-   _Left Right and Centre_ (1959) – Peteron\n-   _Clue of the Silver Key_ (1961) – Mike Hennessey\n-   _Invasion_ (1965) – Lawrence Blackburn\n-   _Doctor in Clover_ (1966) – Dr. Dean Loftus\n-   _Martin Soldat_ (1966) – Le major\n-   _The Jokers_ (1967) – Prosecuting Lawyer (uncredited)\n-   _I'll Never Forget What's'isname_ (1967) – Mr. Hamper Down (uncredited)\n-   _Hot Millions_ (1968) – Hollis (uncredited)\n-   _Crossplot_ (1969) – Vicar\n-   _Doctor in Trouble_ (1970) – Chief Surgeon\n-   _No Blade of Grass_ (1970) – Sir Charles Brenner\n-   _Die Screaming, Marianne_ (1971) – Registrar\n-   _A Clockwork Orange_ (1971) – Minister Frederick\n-   _I Want What I Want_ (1972) – Mr. Parkhurst\n-   _Some Kind of Hero_ (1972) – Barrister\n-   _Black Snake_ (1973) – Lord Clive\n-   _Gawain and the Green Knight_ (1973) – King\n-   _Mistress Pamela_ (1974) – Longman\n-   _Percy's Progress_ (1974) – Judge\n-   _The Amorous Milkman_ (1975) – Counsel\n-   _One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing_ (1975) – Home Secretary\n-   _Barry Lyndon_ (1975) – Lord Hallam\n-   _House of Mortal Sin_ (1976) – Father Xavier Meldrum\n-   _Crossed Swords_ (1977) – Dr. Buttes\n-   _Abortar en Londres_ (1977) – Dr. Brown\n-   _Schalcken the Painter_ (1979, TV Movie) – Gentleman\n-   _Never Say Never Again_ (1983) – Lord Ambrose\n\n[1] John Parker (ed), _Who's Who in the Theatre_ (15th edition), Pitman Publishing 1972\n\n[2] Frances Stephens, _Theatre World Annual (London)_ vol 3, Rockliff Publishing Corporation 1952\n\n[3] 'Dates for Your Diary', _Curtain Up: The Only Repertory Theatre Magazine_ vol 12 no 8, 28 February 1955\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] Jonathan Rigby, _English Gothic: A Century of Horror Cinema_, Reynolds & Hearn 2000\n\n[7] Brian MacFarlane (ed), _The Encyclopedia of British Film_, BFI/Methuen 2003\n\n[8] \n\n[9] Anthony Sharp, 'About the Author', _Curtain Up: The Only Repertory Theatre Magazine_ vol 12 no 8, 28 February 1955''\n\n[10] \n\n[11] Jean Anouilh (trans Michael Frayn), _Number One_, Samuel French 1984\n",

    "passage": "[jun17-13-34948064]\n\n_Mr. Smith was ready to be discharged home after his laryngectomy, an extensive operation that removes a patient’s throat due to cancer. In the opinion of Dr. Lu-Myers, he was a capable man who had passed his physical and occupational therapy evaluations with flying colors. Mr. Smith had fulfilled the doctor’s list of clinical discharge criteria, and she was eager to send him home. She planned to entrust him and his family to manage his dressing changes, as well as his tracheostomy and drain care, with the support of frequent outpatient nursing visits — all very routine protocol, especially for someone who seemed alert and capable._\n\n_The day before Mr. Smith was to be discharged, Dolores, his nurse, approached Dr. Lu-Myers with some concerns: “Mr. Smith seems depressed to me, and you know, his wife has never come by to visit. I’m worried about us discharging him.” Dolores explained that Mr. Smith was undergoing a divorce, his children were not around, and he would likely be living alone. With the responsibility for his care now a concern, it was unsafe to discharge him. The care team ultimately found him a temporary rehabilitation facility where he recovered for two weeks until he was ready to go home._\n\nThis fictionalized vignette highlights an important aspect of health care: Providers often have vastly different ways of seeing and treating patients, as differences in profession, specialty, experience, or background lead them to pay attention to particular signals or cues and influence how they approach problems. For instance, one person might assess a patient through a clinical lens, focusing on whether the patient meets clinical criteria for discharge, while another might see the patient through a personal or social lens, considering the patient’s broader support system at home.\n\nHow these lenses are brought together to inform decision making can have profound implications for patients. While diverse perspectives and approaches to care are important, if they are not managed appropriately, they can cause misunderstandings, bias decision making, and get in the way of the best care. For instance, had the providers in Mr. Smith’s case not communicated effectively, he may have been sent home too soon, which could have led to complications or readmission.\n\nUnfortunately, this collaboration tends to be the exception rather than the norm in many health care organizations. Communication failures are a common cause of patient harm. They are often due to a culture that does not promote the systematic sharing of differing perspectives, instead supporting a hierarchy of power and one-way transmissions of information — both of which hinder effective communication.\n\nDifferences in the lenses providers use to see and make sense of patients’ needs extend beyond physicians and nurses. For instance, when emergency department physicians handed off patients to hospital wards, they agreed with hospital physicians about the patient’s primary problem in fewer than 50% of handoffs. This is closely linked with ineffective communication and frequently leads to increases in medical errors and malpractice claims.\n\nInsight Center\n\n-   The Leading Edge of Health Care\n\n    Sponsored by Optum\n\n    How the most innovative providers are creating value.\n\nEven within the same specialty, providers can have varying perspectives and approaches to care, due to their different backgrounds and experiences. Female physicians, for example, are more likely than male physicians to follow evidence-based practice and to engage in more preventive services (e.g., cancer screening) and communication (e.g., information giving, partnership building). Research has also demonstrated that male cardiologists are more likely to conduct invasive cardiac procedures on the average patient than their female counterparts are (which may be warranted for some patients but less so for others). Similarly, other health care professionals, such as system administrators and managers, also bring varying perspectives to their work that can influence the care patients receive, as highlighted in research by one of us (Jemima) on the racial backgrounds of opioid treatment program managers.\n\nEach way of seeing a particular issue has its pros and cons; what matters is that providers learn to consider each other’s perspectives and communicate effectively when working together. This is the only way teams can reach a shared understanding of a patient’s diagnosis, identify and resolve any blind spots around an issue, and develop more-robust, well-rounded treatment approaches.\n\nSimilarly, individuals must learn to appreciate the limits of their own perspective and seek to adopt other lenses when complex problems demand it. We all adopt a default way of seeing any given issue, which can bias our choices and cause us to overlook other important details. This has been demonstrated in the classic “invisible gorilla” experiment, where participants were so focused on counting basketball passes in a video that they failed to notice someone in a gorilla suit walk by. And this tendency has been shown to impact health care providers as well. For example, in one study (inspired by the gorilla experiment), researchers asked radiologists to examine a set of CT scans of lungs for anomalous nodules. What the researchers didn’t disclose was that they had placed an image of a gorilla (larger than the average nodule) on one set of the lung images. The result: 83% of the radiologists missed the gorilla.\n\nIn our work to promote more-effective decision making and evidence-based practice, we have come across at least two ways that health professionals can get better at communicating with each other and adopting multiple lenses themselves.\n\nCREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS PERSPECTIVE SHARING AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AMONG TEAM MEMBERS. The multidisciplinary care team model, championed in modern health care, brings together different providers (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers, and other specialists) to treat patients. This works best when teams communicate effectively and integrate their diverse perspectives.\n\nOur colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality have shown how utilizing multidisciplinary teams in emergency departments can decrease the risk of misdiagnosis — a costly error that can result in patients being undertreated or overtreated. For instance, many patients come to the ER complaining of dizziness, a symptom that can indicate a variety of possible diagnoses. They found that including a physical therapist in the emergency department care team helped them more accurately diagnose causes of dizziness among ER patients, resulting in better treatment, better patient satisfaction, and faster discharge. This is because the physical therapist had specialized knowledge of a vestibular assessment technique that can help diagnose cause of dizziness.\n\nBut in order to leverage the benefits of others’ expertise, teams need to prioritize open communication. This requires a strong cultural shift toward voicing opinions and concerns and away from the often siloed, hierarchical, and blaming culture that can predominate in health care settings. Building this culture requires both top-down and bottom-up efforts, but leaders can set the tone through their actions and the behavior they reward among care team members.\n\nOne way to create this culture is to have teams practice sharing and adopting different lenses using simulations. We have begun implementing a case-based teaching exercise among surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and technicians who work together to deliver surgical care to patients at Johns Hopkins. The goal is to help them recognize, surface, and integrate different lenses. In our simulation they must decide how to deal with a problematic surgeon who is receiving many complaints from coworkers. The exercise reveals team members’ different default ways of seeing the situation and allows them to practice adopting different lenses and combining each other’s different perspectives. In doing so, they can hone the effective communication needed to make better decisions during patient care.\n\nImportantly, improving patient care doesn’t always mean bringing in different specialties, but it does involve team members being willing to acknowledge different perspectives and learn from one another. Sharing lenses with other people in one’s field — such as male and female surgeons sharing how they’d approach a particular patient — can give providers a more comprehensive view of a patient and a more robust plan for action. This is critical for improving care.\n\nBUILD INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS’ CAPACITY TO ADOPT MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES. Not all patient care decisions are made in a team setting, so individuals must also practice applying different lenses to overcome the limitations of their default lens and improve their decision making. For example, they can ask, “If I was viewing this as my colleague would, would I see something else?”\n\nLeaders in health care organizations can help by creating more opportunities for different professions to “shadow” one another. For instance, having a physician spend a few days working closely with and observing a nurse in a hospital might help them better understand how nurses respond to patient requests or challenges. Likewise, physicians, nurses, and others who work in one particular specialty might gain new lenses by rotating through a different specialty. While this rotation is common in clinicians’ early careers (e.g., during residency), ongoing exposure throughout their careers may help broaden their expertise and improve their problem solving. For instance, surgeon Atul Gawande recently wrote about his own transformative experience visiting primary care headache clinics and learning from their unique approach to diagnosing and treating patients.\n\nResearch by one of us (Kathleen) has demonstrated how individuals with experiences in different work domains, called having “intrapersonal functional diversity,” can improve team performance by promoting greater sharing of information among team members. This boosts performance more than simply bringing together different subject matter experts.\n\nBuilding this intrapersonal diversity requires not only exposing providers to different experiences but also continually creating opportunities for them to apply what they learn so that they develop a habit of viewing challenging decisions through multiple lenses. For example, hospitals can create simulation, reflection, and mentoring programs to encourage clinicians to review and learn from their experiences.\n\nTransformations in the U.S. health care system, along with the complex needs of patients, demand more-effective communication and collaboration among the various members of care teams. Understanding how to leverage and coordinate different perspectives will help to cut down on miscommunications and improve patient care. Errors can be avoided — and lives saved — by reducing the common tendency to view complex clinical issues through just one lens. Using perspective-expanding approaches to care, at both the team and individual level, will go a long way toward improving patient care and health outcomes.\n",

    "passage": "Lions in May. A love story. Part 1 of ? [may end up longer than expected but this is a story I want to share, and would like participation as well.] x-post\n\n\nPlease give me feedback too on my writing style, and structure. I'm trying to get better as a hobby.  I understand this may not be the right place.../r/offmychest hasn't provided anything to me, and really I'm just looking for participation in this to all that are intrigued.  I have a good story to tell.  With that said, I'm open to advice (any regardless of writing, relationship, etc), comments, and questions.  Please sit back, drink, snack, whatever...and enjoy.\n\n\nHello. Ello. Greetings. Currently I'm down in the dumps with a six pack of cheap beer. Coors original tall boys incase you were wondering. You see my cat ran away today, and she has been missing for quite a few hours now. She's microchipped, and yes...I've been actively making signs. That's not what this story is about.\nI'm sorry, but I'm going to have to call you 'Reader'. I really wish we could have met formally under different circumstances. You can call me Jam. It's nice to meet you.\n\n\nYou see, we met back in May. The 19th to be exact, and it was a Saturday. 2012 was a fun year for the both of us. I made a post on Craigslist looking for some sort of companionship, and apparently my post caught your eye. A friendship blossomed into something special. I couldn't have asked for a better friend. You were gay, and I was in the closet thousands of miles away from friends and family. I didn't have any friends until I met you. I find it eerily awesome that you messaged me wanting to hang out. It was my brother birthday, he would have been 25. I met the most amazing person on my brother's birthday (he past away years ago). We emailed each other back, and forth getting to know each other--music, hobbies, views on life...the whole 9 yards. Finally you asked for my number, and I obliged. We began texting each other until you were the one with enough courage to want to meet up. Something about Leos, and making the first step, and me being shy. Sunday the 20th comes around, and you waited outside of my house. I was running a bit behind, and you got scared because security from the gated community was driving around. I quickly texted you not to worry, and to come back. We almost never met. I walked up to your car, very timidly, and opened the door. You extended your hand, and said \"Hello, my name is &lt;person&gt;. Nice to meet you!\". With a very firm handshake, your jade green eyes stared into my soul. Instantly I knew you were the one. A feeling of peace, excitement...LOVE for once came over me. What was about a 3 sec handshake seemed to have lasted an eternity. I replied staring in to captivating eyes--\"Nice to meet you too! I'm Jam! (still thinking of his accent as well. It was foreign and vague. I couldn't put my finger on it)\" We then drove off, and it was like we had knew each other from a past life. Our conversation in the car consisted of music, movies, art, views on life, aliens, astral projection, psychedelics, and so forth. Haha, oh man, I stopped him in the middle of one of his sentences, and actually said \"Oh my goodness, I have to tell you...you smell really good.\" He got a laugh out of that, and simply replied \"Why thank you! Well if we are going to compliment each other right now, I must say I've been thinking of your eyes this entire time. They are absolutely beautiful\" We both laughed, and continued to converse.\n\n\nWe had arrived to the mall.\n\n\nWe entered through Dick's Sporting Goods. He took toward the outdoors section, and we browsed--not looking for anything in particular, and at this point we had started talking about how much we enjoyed the outdoors, camping, and so on. Our favorite sceneries. The sound of a thunderstorm. The soothing rustle of trees being hit by a soft breeze. The way the full moon hits the water on a clear night. Even laying down, and staring at the stars. Every now, and again we would finish the other's sentence. Corny I know! But trust me, if you were there, Reader, it would make you smile. Eventually, we made our way out of the sporting store, and headed up to the second level of the mall. We walked around still talking, before our stomachs rumbled. We heard each other, and at the same time asked \"What would you like to eat?!\" followed by chuckling again at how we instantly knew. I know, I know Reader, corny--yes. We both decided on Panda Express due to the lack of option. If I'm not mistaken he ordered the coconut shrimp, I'm not positive it was coconut, but I am positive it was shrimp. I on the other hand had a veggie bowl. That was when we both found out that we were both pescetarian. So many things in common.\n\n\nWe finished our food, and were at a loss of what to do next. We headed outside to smoke a cigarette. They were American Spirits. In a yellow pack. Discussing life, parallel universes this time, and the changes the universe is going through. I remember it like it was yesterday. Reader, you see, this is how big of impact this person has had on my life. To remember the most insignificant details. I promise you though, Reader--this is a good story the more it goes on. I apologize, I got side tracked. Alright, yellow American Spirits, talking, oh that's right. We decided on seeing a movie. Nothing was in the theatre at the time that really got our attention, but we ultimately both enjoy Johnny Depp, and Dark Shadows was in so we took to that.\n\n\nEntering the theatre we got the best seats in the house! Center, and center! Other people were there, but not many. The movie started, and the dry humor got both of us. We cracked out laughing at the line \"Child bearing hips\" for some reason. I could see out of the corner of my eye, you glancing at me every know, and again with the most adorable smile. Then felt your elbow touch mine. It was like I was in middle school again! Now Reader, I understand that things like this sound stupid as hell, but trust me on this...just trust me, this childish flirting that was going on throughout the day...isn't for random dates, hookups, etc. It's the small things that make you look back, and smile on. So please take my advice when I say don't take things like this for granted. So his elbow touched mine throughout the movie, me being shy I wanted to pull it away because I'm still questioning my sexuality at the time, but I didn't. I rode it out through the entire movie. I liked it. It was comforting. It made me feel good. It made me feel like I was appreciated. It made me feel liked for a change. Then the movie ended.\n\n\nWe walked out the theatre door because the mall was closed at the time, and we couldn't enter the sporting store were we had parked due to the gates being closed. So we decided to walk clear around the mall. It was a warm night. Perfect out. The breeze was just right, no clouds, and the stars. Oh man the stars! Everything was perfect. We continued to talk without missing a beat. It was nice for a change to talk to someone that could hold a conversation that didn't involve sex, drugs, cock size, the same boring cliche stuff. I had asked him what he had planned for the rest of the evening, and he just simply replied \"Nothing. I was going to head home, why?\" I asked if he would like to continue through the night. He replied excitedly \"Yes!\". We settled on sushi for dinner. getting the California roll, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, unagi, and Philly rolls. It was happy hour too! We sat at the bar outside, and just looked at each other every so often, and grinned, and looked away. Sort of like flirting peek-a-boo. Which is funny, Reader, when you realize that we are both straight acting, masculine men. We are honestly like children right now. But it is still one of the best feelings I have ever felt. Haha Reader, would you believe if I told you right now as I'm typing this that I have a smile on my face, and a tear in my eye? So as we are doing this, a black couple is seated next to us. The man was wearing a white v-neck with a blazer, and his date was wearing a beautiful floral dress. It was then that he texted me saying \"Oh my gosh, that woman is absolutely gorgeous!\" I agreed. However, what we found comical was that they went on a date to one of the best sushi places in the United States, and ordered the chicken. We got a kick out of that. But hey, to each his own right?\n\n\nWe eventually, we finished our meals/ rolls, and walked around the Plaza reflecting on our pasts, sharing our history, trials and tribulations. What we have both experienced, and so forth. I wasn't ready to share my past with him, or how significant the day was that we met, and what I have been through, but I could tell he some how knew. Sharing a cigarette walking through the night, before looking at our phones, and realizing how late it has become. At this point it is about 12:34am. As we head back to his vehicle, Death Cab for Cutie is playing, and we just sat there in silence, and enjoyed it. Glancing over at the other, and grinning. In all honesty Reader..no date could have gone more perfect than this one.\n\n\nShowing up at my house, he dropped me off. We sat there for what seemed like years, me staring into those jade green eyes, and smiled, and said \"Have a good night, and thank you for everything.\" (I really wanted to kiss him Reader! I was too nervous though!) I get out of the car (a man mind you), and I'm as giddy as a school girl, and as I reach my door to unlock it I receive his text saying \"I'd really like to see you again. There is just something about you that I can't let go.\" Now Reader, please understand that this isn't something that was jumping the gun too quickly. If you could have been there you would understand that this evening was unique...almost magical. So after I received that text, I went to my room, to lay down staring at the text for 5-10 minutes trying to figure out how to respond. Again, keep in mind that I have never done anything with a guy before at this point. I have only been with women. So I took the chance, and said \"I would like that a lot actually.\" He then responded with \"Look, this may be too soon, but I really wanted to kiss you in the car before dropping you off. I don't want to freak you out or anything because your ad said that you were mainly looking for friends, and what not. But I really wanted to kiss you goodnight\" I responded \"I wanted to kiss you too, but I didn't know how you felt! I was nervous, and didn't want to act on my emotions too soon! I do want to see you again though...I just don't want to rush things.\" He just replied \"I understand, no rush, but I do like you :)\" (You think just bitches like smilies? Fuck that, even grown men enjoy them on occasion). It was then that we wished each other a good night, and set up a second date.\n\n\nReader, I just want to let you know that this story is 100% honest. I've had this story pent up inside of me for the longest time, and I really would like sharing it more, and more.\n\n\nThank you for reading, please feel free to ask questions.",

    "passage": "Despite great success as a standup comedian and former host of Comedy Central's _Standup Nation_, Greg Giraldo is tortured by a constant sense of failure. \"I feel like I'm ‘the piece of shit at the center of the universe,' he told me. \"The reality is I'm not a 'get knocked down and come back harder' kind of guy. I'm a complete fuckup... I feel like quitting all the time.\"\n\nTo accompany the cover story on failure in the current issue of Psychology Today, \"Weathering the Storm,\" I asked celebrities about their perspective on getting through the tough times in their own lives. This is the first interview in the series. —Jay Dixit\n\n[]\n\n(Photo: Dan Dion)\n\n[]\n\nWHAT HAVE BEEN YOUR GREATEST FAILURES?\n\nIt's hard to distinguish when I was actually struggling from when I only felt like I was struggling—which was pretty much always.\n\nYOU WENT TO HARVARD LAW SCHOOL THEN DROPPED OUT. TELL ME ABOUT THE DECISION TO QUIT.\n\nIt was scary. I had a lot of student debt and I didn't know where the career was going. I started doing comedy for the hell of it and I thought, \"I'll pursue that somehow until I figure out what I'm actually going to do for a living to pay my loans.\" I didn't think comedy was a viable career option.\n\nBut before I quit, I was dying. I mean, I couldn't do it. It wasn't like I was a functioning professional and I just made the choice to throw it all away to pursue this crazy dream. I was incapable of being a lawyer. It wasn't an option. I was going to stop being a lawyer whether I wanted to or not.\n\nHOW DID YOU FEEL?\n\nMy family was disappointed. But I always wanted to do something creative. I've always had real trouble knowing what my actual desires and goals are. I've just been dragged along by fate. I can't even tell you why I thought to go to law school.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT GIVES YOU YOUR SENSE OF PURPOSE?\n\nI'm a total fuckup, honestly. The reality is I'm not this person with this driving \"get it done\" attitude. I'm a complete fuckup and I've fucked up a lot of things in my life. I'm constantly tortured by a sense of failure. I feel like quitting all the time. I feel like hiding in drugs or alcohol. I feel like I've failed in terms of what my potential is. I don't think I've achieved my potential because I haven't worked that hard and I haven't found the right angles. The reality is, I'm not a \"get knocked down and just pull myself back up by my bootstraps and come back harder\" kind of guy.\n\nWHAT'S THAT LIKE, THAT FEELING OF BEING TORTURED BY FAILURE?\n\nIt's a lot of self-hatred. That I should have gone to L.A. for pilot season. That I should have drank a lot less.\n\nThere's all these things I've fucked up. If I had only stayed focused, I would have been further along. It's this constant feeling of not having achieved enough.\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT? IS IT ALWAYS THERE? DOES IT GO AWAY IF YOU WORK HARDER?\n\nIf I'm working on something and I feel like I did a good job, it goes away for a little while. If I write a new chunk of material I love, it goes away for a little bit. If I feel like I have a lot of shows with new material, it goes away for a bit. Then there's all the other unrelated-to-comedy shit—the therapy, trying to feel like I'm OK where I am.\n\nWHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE ON YOU? DOES IT GIVE YOU SOME FIRE IN A WAY THAT HELPS YOU?\n\nIt definitely drives me. That at least is good. The desire to feel like you're not a loser drives me. I don't know if that's the healthiest thing—to be motivated by a fear of hating yourself. But it definitely helps. In a perfect world I would overcome the sense that I suck constantly.\n\nIF YOU DID OVERCOME THAT FEELING COULD YOU STILL DO COMEDY?\n\nI used to think maybe not. But I think I have to. For a while I thought dwelling in that darkness and that self-hatred worked, but eventually it becomes more crippling than good. I could definitely still be funny. Some people do better when they're in a bitter, angry place. I don't. I think I'm funniest when I'm feeling more optimistic, hopeful about everything.\n\nWHAT ABOUT MISTAKES?\n\nEmotionally I dwell on things forever. I'm an obsessive thinker. I obsess on things I've done wrong. Even worse than mistakes, I'll dwell on what I'm not doing at the moment and what my limitations are.\n\nGIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.\n\nWhat I'm not doing is writing more. Each day that goes by, I think, \"I meant to write, but I didn't.\" And the days go by.\n\nRather than sitting at the computer and writing, actually finishing things and fleshing out thoughts, I just rely on going on stage and dicking around until the funny parts occur to me. I'm constantly tormented by the fact that if I could get organized enough to just sit down and write, I would be 50 times further than I am today, creatively.\n\nProfessionally, there are a million things I could do. I'm always asked if I have any ideas for sitcoms or dramas or anything I'd like to pitch. I have a lot of opportunities to come in and have meetings with people who can make decisions on these things... and I don't.\n\nI've had people over the years approach me and say, \"Come in any time with movie ideas!\" These are people who could make these things happen. I get excited about it, I think about it, I come up with a few ideas, and then I get all fucking ADD and the opportunity slips away. Maybe I should have eaten some protein before we had this conversation. I could have been more upbeat.\n\nWHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOURSELF FROM THE OUTSIDE—OR TO SOMEONE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION?\n\nOn days when I'm feeling positive, I say, \"Look. Wait a second. I started doing standup just 17 years ago, just for the hell of it really, and I thought 'I'll do this until I figure out what I can really earn a living doing.' And now all of a sudden I'm really proud of what I can do with standup comedy, I'm a much better standup comic than I ever imagined I would be, and I've made a decent living doing it. And it seems like I'm poised to do better.\" I'm living the life I've always wanted, in a lot of ways. I try to be as appreciative of what I've been given as possible. When I'm feeling upbeat that helps.\n\nStaying grateful and even sometimes being so fucking corny as making a mental list of what I have to be grateful for. That definitely helps, when I'm feeling positive. I don't know if it's the chicken or egg. When I'm feeling in a darker place, my perception is that everything sucks and even though I've done this, it seems I should have done more. Trying to stay grateful helps.\n\nAnd a lot of times, I'll think, \"I'm not really that talented, and I have maximized what I've gotten.\" And that I should stop kicking the shit out of myself.\n\nIt's a paradoxical way to look at it—positive and negative at the same time. Who the fuck am I to think I was entitled to this great career? That I should have done more? That I deserved more? I've done more than I deserved.\n\nBUT YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL. SO IS IT THAT YOU JUST THINK YOU SHOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL? OR THAT SOMEHOW YOU'RE A FRAUD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WORK THAT HARD AND YOU'VE ACHIEVED THIS SUCCESS?\n\nYou're coming up with angles that are true that I haven't thought of!\n\nI'M JUST WONDERING WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOU.\n\nA lot of it is fear of the future. Do I want to be a 55-year-old man, working the clubs, traveling around the country, not doing theaters, not being enough of a name? If I didn't have this family to support, if I wasn't living in the city, if we weren't in the greatest fucking economic downturn ever, I would probably feel I was fine.\n\nYes, I feel, not like a fraud, but frustrated with myself and my limitations. They don't feel like they're creative limitations. I just get too distracted by life and don't focus on what matters to me.\n\nWHAT QUESTION SHOULD I HAVE ASKED YOU THAT I DIDN'T ASK?\n\nHow I feel about Jesus? Gay porn, yea or nay?\n\nAs I talk to you, some things are crystallizing in my head. It's actually very helpful. I hadn't thought about it this way. Trying to focus on what really it is that matters to me.\n\nWhen I start to feel like a failure, I realize, it's really that I haven't worked harder on my standup. And I can do that. Focusing on things that are manageable, that can be done, things I have control over. Right now I'm feeling like shit. I have two shows tonight. Now's the time, I'll definitely crank out some new shit before then. And that gives me a sense of optimism and hope I'm not being crushed by this broader system.\n\nWHAT IS IT THAT DISTRACTS YOU?\n\nIt's a lot of things. I have three kids, and I love them more than anything. It's easy to obsess, not even in a healthy way, distracted by worries about them and their future and how they're doing. How they feel and how they're coping. Thoughts that are not productive.\n\nWhen I'm actually with them, doing things with them, I feel great, fueled by that. But it's so easy to wallow in self-hatred, like, \"Shit, I fucked up. I let my relationship fall apart. Now they're living with their mom and I don't see them.\" Instead of letting that fuel me creatively, it becomes a sinkhole.\n\nOther things are just general bullshit. I'm easily distracted—I start watching television. I start searching the Web. For years I'd go on the road and I'd finish the shows and instead of going back to the hotel room and reading, I'd stay out all night and get in all sorts of trouble—trying to escape that sense of fear by ripping it up out there. Getting done with the shows and riding that high, thinking, \"I am good, and what better way to keep that going than partying?\" That's been an enormous distraction from my work.\n\nYOU MENTIONED LETTING WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS FUEL YOU CREATIVELY VERSUS GETTING CAUGHT IN A SINKHOLE. WHAT'S THE TRICK TO LETTING IT FUEL YOU CREATIVELY? HOW DO YOU DIRECT THAT NEGATIVE ENERGY TO SOMETHING POSITIVE?\n\nI've tried to on occasion just write about it and feel being fueled by it creatively is very difficult. Standup in particular is a very specific thing. There's things you want to talk about, to express—but you have to be funny. And you have to funny to a mass audience. It's a constant frustrating thing. I might write something I think resonates with me and would with other people in my situation, but it just doesn't get the laughs you need because you're performing it for 20-year-olds in the Comedy Cellar.\n\nThere's enormous frustration there. The way it has fueled me recently is this sense that I want my kids to be proud of me, and if I'm not good at what I do, and if I'm not trying my hardest at what I do, then all this shit I'm putting them through because of my demons has been a waste. The very least I can do for them is to be the best I can. That does help me feel like, \"OK, take your shit more seriously. Don't just throw away stage time. Don't let the days go by without having done any work.\" That's been working. Then sometimes I feel what they need from me is to be relatively content and to be there for them, so I can't torture myself over this stuff. But I do anyway.\n\nDO YOU THINK PART OF IT IS THAT YOU BLAME YOURSELF FOR THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF YOUR CONTROL?\n\nIt could be. I tend to blame myself for everything. There's an expression I've heard used for people in my shoes, people who see themselves like I see myself. I feel like I'm \"the piece of shit at the center of the universe.\" It's a paradox. You feel like you're so shitty you ruin everything, but you're so important and powerful that you caused it, that you actually are to blame for everything. I'm doing the best I can, and maybe that's enough. It depends on how much sugar I've had that day.\n\n_For other comedian interviews, see also:_\n\nGeorge Carlin's Last Interview\n\nThe Psychology Today Humor Round Table\n\nOrny Adams on Failure\n\n",

    "passage": "One Minute to Zero\n\n_ONE MINUTE TO ZERO_ is a 1952 romantic war film starring Robert Mitchum and Ann Blyth, set during the opening phases of the Korean War, and produced by Howard Hughes as his last film as producer.[1] The film showcases the contributions of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, the South Korean Army, the United Nations, the British Army and the Royal Australian Air Force during the early days of the Korean War.[2] The effects of air power in the Korean War were also vividly depicted through the use of combat footage.\n\n\nPlot\n\nJust prior to the North Korean invasion of South Korea, World War II U.S. Army veterans Colonel Steve Janowski (Robert Mitchum) and Sergeant Baker (Charles McGraw) are teaching South Korean soldiers how to use a bazooka to stop an enemy tank. Linda Day (Ann Blyth) is a United Nations worker assisting refugees. Janowski warns Day and her colleagues to leave the area because hostilities are imminent. Day, however, insists that the North Koreans would not risk the wrath of world opinion. In response, Janowski asks her if world opinion stopped Hitler.\n\nSoon after, Janowski and U.S. Air Force Colonel Joe Parker (William Talman) wake up and find themselves under attack. They compare the attack to Pearl Harbor (“Isn't this where we came in?” “It's even Sunday morning!”). Janowski takes command of a U.S. Army unit which is helping to evacuate Americans and refugees. While doing his job, he keeps crossing paths, and falling in love, with Day. It turns out that she is reluctant to get involved with a soldier because she is the widow of a Medal of Honor recipient.\n\nAs part of a desperate situation, Janowski is confronted by a column of refugees which has been infiltrated by armed North Korean guerrillas. He has no choice but to call in an artillery strike. Even though Janowski is remorseful for the civilian casualties, Day initially condemns him for killing innocent people. After she finds out the reason for Janowski's action (and that he was right), she apologizes.\n\nJanowski leads a successful American counter offensive against the enemy. The contributions of the British Army and the Royal Australian Air Force are both featured in the film, and are both explicitly mentioned as evidence that “the whole world” is “in this together”.\n\n\nCast\n\n[Robert Mitchum and Charles McGraw were inseparable during the film's production and ended up in trouble at a local bar.[3]] As appearing in _One Minute to Zero_ (main roles and screen credits identified):[4]\n\n-   Robert Mitchum as Col. Steve Janowski\n-   Ann Blyth as Linda Day\n-   William Talman as Col. John Parker\n-   Charles McGraw as Sgt. Baker\n-   Margaret Sheridan as Mary Parker\n-   Richard Egan as Capt. Ralston\n-   Eduard Franz as Gustav Engstrand\n-   Robert Osterloh as Major Davis\n-   Robert Gist as Major Carter\n-   Stuart Whitman as Officer (uncredited)\n-   Kathleen O'Malley as Mrs. Norton\n-   Wallace Russell as Pilot Norton\n-   Lalo Ríos as Pvt. Chico Mendoza (uncredited)\n\n\nProduction\n\nThe film's working title was _The Korean Story_. Ted Tetzlaff was the first director assigned by RKO. He was replaced, however, by Tay Garnett because producer Edmund Grainger (famed for _Sands of Iwo Jima_ and _Flying Leathernecks_) wanted a “bigger” name as director.[5]\n\nThe original actress chosen as leading lady was Claudette Colbert. She became ill with pneumonia, however, and although Grainger wanted Joan Crawford, the role had been rewritten for a younger person. Eventually, Ann Blyth became the replacement.[6]\n\nAlthough RKO attempted to shoot second unit footage in South Korea,[7] _One Minute to Zero_ was filmed at Fort Carson, Colorado, using troops of the 148th Field Artillery.[8] During a break, Mitchum, Egan, McGraw and other cast members showed up at a local hotel bar frequented by the soldiers in the nearby base. McGraw got into an argument with an army private escalating from a shoving match to a fistfight when Mitchum tried to break it up. The soldier ended up being stretchered out but news of the altercation resulted in Hughes having to intervene when U.S. Army officials threatened to pull their support for the film.[9]{{#tag:ref| “The incident might have rated only a paragraph ...” biographer George Eells recounted in _Robert Mitchum_ (1984), “... had Mitchum's adversary not turned out to be [a] former light heavyweight professional boxer with a record of twenty-six wins – nineteen of them knockouts – and two losses between 1946 and 1947.”[10]|group=Note}}\n\nHoward Hughes, the owner of RKO, had received massive U.S. military cooperation in the making this film.[11] Nonetheless, he refused to delete the refugee massacre scene when requested to do so by the U.S. Army.[12]\n\nVictor Young's score for the film includes the first appearance of “When I Fall In Love.” It is performed as an instrumental piece by its lyricist, Edward Heyman. The song, performed here by Doris Day, went on to become a popular hit song recorded by a variety of artists.[13]\n\n\nReception\n\nAlthough considered standard fare for war films, even tinged with propaganda, _One Minute to Zero_ received notice because of one controversial scene showing the U.S. shelling refugees being forced through U.N. lines by North Korean infiltrators.[14]{{#tag:ref|The incident in the film resembled that of the No Gun Ri Massacre on July 26–29, 1950, when up to 300 refugees were killed, except that no evidence emerged of infiltrators at No Gun Ri.[15][16]|group=Note}} Bosley Crowther of _The New York Times_ dismissed most of the action-based story in a review that noted, \"Like a great many war pictures, this one is patly contrived with elements not only of romance but also of melodrama, comedy and tears. There is the usual amount of jaw-jutting by angry and earnest G. I.'s who find themselves caught in situations from which salvation seems beyond hope. ... Plainly, “One Minute to Zero” is a ripely synthetic affair, arranged to arouse emotions with the most easy and obvious clichés. And, although some of the battle talk sounds faithful and the inter-cut news shots are sincere, neither the story nor the performances of the actors, including Miss Blyth and Mr. Mitchum, rings true. Here is another war picture that smells of grease paint and studios.\"[17]\n\nAlong with Retreat, Hell! which premiered earlier in the same year, One Minute To Zero was heavily promoted in some locales where a number of drive in theaters showed it as their only option for several consecutive months. This was the case at a series of locally owned drive in theaters in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. As a result of this in the Wisconsin counties of Polk County, Barron County, Price County, Clark County, Marinette County, Oconto County, Shawano County, Waupaca County, Dodge County and Taylor County it was the only movie one could see in a drive in for multiple consecutive months. This was also the case in the Indiana counties of Kosciusko County, Whitley County, Huntington County, Adams County, Morgan County, Jackson County and Greene County. This was also the case in Ogle County, Illinois and Bureau County, Illinois. These same theaters had shown Retreat Hell! as their only feature for several months earlier in the same year, until they switched over to showing One Minute to Zero as their only option for the following several months that July. These same drive in theaters would only do this again on one more occasion, which would be for the movie Tarzan and the Lost Safari which was released in 1957[18]\n\nThe intercutting of stock footage of USAF Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and Royal Australian Air Force North American P-51 Mustang fighter-bombers, along with other aerial sequences has made _One Minute to Zero_ an aviation film buff's favorite.[19]\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] \n\n[2] Appleman, Roy E. _South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu (June–November 1950)._ Washington, D.C.: Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, 1961.\n\n[3] \n\n[4] “Credits: One Minute to Zero.” _Turner Classic Movies._ Retrieved: November 23, 2012.\n\n[5] \n\n[6] Rode 2007, pp. 95–96.\n\n[7] \n\n[8] “Korean War 50th Anniversary.” _Pass in Review newsletter_ (Idaho Military History Museum), March 2002.\n\n[9] \n\n[10] Eells 1984, p. 156.\n\n[11] Steinberg, Jay S. “Articles: One Minute to Zero.” _Turner Classic Movies._ Retrieved: November 24, 2012.\n\n[12] Suid 2002, p. 137.\n\n[13] Whitburn, Joel. _Top Pop Records 1940–1955_.

    "passage": "[MF] Golden Child: The Forgotten Sisters\n\n(I hope that's the right tag. First time posting here)\n\n\n\n  We were twins, you know. Or perhaps you don't; we are the most often overlooked part of the story. Glossed over with only a few lines. You'd think we were born for the sole purpose of being a minor obstacle to the True Heroine of the tale. We were not. We were twins.\n\n  Gwendolen was eldest. Born just hours before myself, though to hear it from her you'd think it was years. Always the responsible one, keeping my restless hands out of trouble. There's a story she loves to tell about us that happened when we were very small. We were supposed to be practicing needlepoint while Mother had business elsewhere in the house. Gwen, of course being the good child, focused only on her sewing while I became distracted by the fire. The glowing coals must have held some allure for me because at some point I'd put down my needle and thread and reached out and grabbed hold of one. It seared my skin and though I cried out in pain I could not open my hand to let it go. Gwen sprung from her chair and pried the coal from me before plunging my hand into a bowl of cool milk left out for the cat. This, she says, saved my hand from being burned to the bone. I don't know if that's true. I have no memory of the event, though I still have a scar in the palm of my hand.\n\n  Mother loved making us compete. She said it made us better if we challenged each other. We got our first corsets at the time of our first bleeding. Mother said it was time we put away childish things and focus on becoming women.\n\n  No longer was I allowed to play in the stables and dirty my pretty dresses. No longer was I permitted to walk among the rose garden and ruin my complexion by way of the sun. No longer was I allowed to challenge the butler's boy in footraces, flashing my knees for all the world to see. I must become quiet, reserved, alluring, educated but not outspoken, slim and pretty but demure, my voice forever hushed. I was not a quiet child and becoming a quiet woman was not an easy task for me.\n\n\"Rosamund,\" my mother would snap. \"Rosamund, keep your voice down! Put your hands by your sides! Wipe that look off your face! Head up, shoulders down! Rosamund are you listening to me? Rosamund, do as I say!\"\n\n  When we were good we were rewarded lavishly - dresses and scarves, and perfumes. When we were bad we were punished severely - slapped, starved, and locked away. We tried so hard to be good girls.\n\n  Father died. His horse spooked at something and Father fell hard, so hard that he never got up again. We wore black for a year.\n\n  At the end of the year, Mother married to a man who was a stranger to us. He too had a daughter. She was a bad girl, running about doing whatever she pleased. Because she was not her own flesh and blood, Mother could not punish the girl as she punished us and so she took out her doubled rage and frustration on her own daughters.\n\n  We were given lessons and expected to succeed at them. Singing, dancing, sewing, riding, etiquette. Every failure was met with a swift reminder that we must be better. \n\n  Vinegar rinse was applied to my hair twice a day to lighten it. A boar bristle brush and caustic soap were used vigorously in an attempt to cure me of my freckles. Mother made me hold my jaw a certain way to make my face appear slimmer and talked about possibly removing teeth from the back of my mouth to improve my smile.\n\n  When it came to our lessons it became clear that I couldn't carry a tune in a bucket whereas Gwendolen sang like a dream. My wretched croak made Mother seethe. But there was one activity where I could outshine Gwen: dance.\n\n  I loved to dance. To feel the music flow like blood in my veins. I moved like a bird in the skies. I always wanted to take things further, to push the movements I was capable of. Twisting, spinning kicking and leaping high, high into the air. I had to be careful though; if Mother thought I was being too enthusiastic she'd bind my feet to make them still.\n\n\"Your dancing is too wild. You will scare your suitors away.\"\n\n  Oh yes, did I mention? All of this was not for our benefit. We were to become brides. We were to become irresistible prizes for wealthy, well connected husbands. Who cared if their faces were handsome or ugly, how kind were their hearts as long as they had lands and titles. As eldest, Gwen was to be married first and it felt like betrayal that that comforted me. I wanted to remain a child a little longer.\n\n  As for our stepsister, anything but the moon was hers for the taking. Our dolls, our ribbons, every moment of our time if she wanted our attention. She roamed freely, sure in her position in the household.\n\n  That all changed when our stepfather died. He grew sick with a coughing in his chest that would not leave. He had time to make our Mother promise to raise his daughter as if she were her own. Mother agreed to do this.\n\n  At first our stepsister's behaviour was understandable. Grief can do powerful things to a person. But more and more little Ella defied our Mother's orders. Such behaviour was unthinkable to myself and Gwen. One evening at the dinner table Ella purposefully spilled a bowl of lentil soup.\n\n  Gwen and I froze, anticipating a beating. It didn't matter that we were on the opposite side of the table, somehow the blame would land on us. We were braced for it.\n\n  Instead Mother changed things. She stood over Ella and made her clean the soup by herself. She told the girl that if she was going to behave as a common peasant that she could live like one. It was a punishment of a whole different kind.\n\n  Ella's room was emptied and her toys given to us, nevermind that we were too old for them. Ella was moved downstairs to a plain room that had been a closet. Mother told her that since she kept ruining her dresses by playing in them she would receive clothing more appropriate to her activities. She took away the things that made her feel entitled to believe she was a little princess. \n\n  Life went on with this new balance of power. Suddenly I was not the lowest of the pecking order. I could scream and shout and vent my frustrations on someone who could not and would not strike back. Gwen, I think, enjoyed her marginal increase in status more than she would ever admit. Now we didn't have to be better than each other; we just had to be better than Ella.\n\n  But even then we were failures. The girl often sang to herself as a way to pass time during chores. I discovered this one painfully boring afternoon as I struggled to master the flute. I thought I must have finally gotten something right before realizing the sound was not coming from my instrument. I set the awful thing down and put my ear against the door. It was definitely coming from downstairs. I followed my ear to the kitchen where Ella was obliviously scrubbing the floors.\n\n  For a while I could not bring myself to interrupt. So beautiful, so ethereal. But I knew when Gwendolen's punishment would be if Mother knew some little girl with no formal lessons was better than my sister. So I slapped her. I told her that if she was ever caught singing I would pour boiling water down her throat so that she could never do it again. Sisters have to protect each other.\n\nTime passed. We all grew up a little more.\n\n  The Royal Family announced a ball to be held in three month's time. They were the worst three months yet. Mother prohibited us from eating anything but fruits so that we would be slim and our breath smell sweet. To drink we were only allowed milk with honey so that our complexions would glow and our voices be soft. The corsets grew tighter and tighter, the lessons more intense. Mother had a mission and that mission was to marry us off. If it was to be one of the nobles at the ball so be it but the real prize was the Prince himself.\n\n  There was more pressure than ever before to be perfect, to be a lure for a future King. Every misstep was called out. Every flaw circled in ink on our bodies and made a target. We had to embody the essence of perfection. Anything less and we might as well not even bother to exist.\n\n  Cinder-Ella's work performance declined sharply. Our lace was burned during ironing, our dresses wrinkled, our jewelry a wild mess. Mother suspected Ella was stealing from us to sabotage our chances. But she could prove nothing until the day of the ball.\n\n  We were gathered in the front hall awaiting the carriage to be brought up when she flounced down the stairs. The reason for Ella's distraction and theft became apparent immediately. She wore a gown - it must have been her mother's once - that had been taken apart at the seams and rebuilt with our ribbons, our fabric, our lost pieces of jewelry. She was glowing, she looked so lovely.\n\n  Mother didn't have to say a word. Just arched an eyebrow and let us tear into Ella like the perfectly trained lapdogs we'd become. I screamed as I took my things back from her. I wanted to hurt her so very badly, this thief, this pretender. How dare she? How dare she be more beautiful than I, so much more talented and poised and perfect without ever trying. How dare she, when I had sacrificed so much to become what she was without effort.\n\nWe left her in the hall, her dress and dignity torn to shreds.\n\n  I broke down in the carriage. Mother handed me a handkerchief to prevent my tears from smudging my carefully applied makeup. She murmured what she must have thought were soothing things about how I might live in a palace soon if I was good enough and that I'd never have to see nasty Cinder-Ella ever again. But I wasn't crying about her. I was crying for the beast my Mother had made me into. I swore to myself that if I did marry the Prince I would restore Ella to the life she'd had before and force my Mother to live in the lowest basement and wear servant's rags. She would never again be our master.\n\n  But of course I didn't marry the Prince. I never even got to share a dance with him because he spent the entire night dancing with a single partner. I watched from the back of the crowd as Mother patted my hair and scraped my scalp with her nails. Her fury was palpable. Unlike Gwen, I found myself inexplicably relieved. I finally understood that I could never live a life that demanded as much pressure for perfection as being a Queen required. I would be happy to melt away in the background and live a life unscrutinised.\n\n  The next morning we learned from a herald that the Prince did not know the object of his affection as well as had been presumed by everyone who had watched them dance. He didn't even know the girl's name! So much for the attentiveness of adoration. What a terrible suitor he made.\n\n  My mind had changed but my Mother's had not. When she got word the Prince himself would be arriving to search our household for his love she flew into a frenzy. Ella was locked away so as not to sabotage us with an act of revenge. We were bathed and scrubbed within an inch of our lives and squeezed into the most absurd dresses yet. We could hardly breathe, let alone walk.\n\n  The herald ushered in the Prince, who carried on a pillow a slipper made of pure glass. *How impractical for dancing,* I thought *All he has to do is check for women with extremely bruised feet.*\n\n  At Mother's request we were allowed to try on the shoe in privacy. I think Mother knew on sight that we would never fit into the ridiculous thing. I assumed that the closed door was to spare us our dignity when we failed. How wrong I was.\n\n  Mother struggled for so long to cram the shoe on Gwendolen's foot but it was a hopeless cause from the beginning. I relaxed a little, thinking that if Gwen as the eldest didn't have a chance then I would be left alone entirely. Wrong. Mother insisted I try as well. My feet were smaller than Gwen's but only by a margin. They were simply too big.\n\nSo Mother cut them down to size.\n\nGwen held me down when Mother brought out the knife. Stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth to stifle the screams.\n\n\"Calm down, child! I'm doing this for you! You'll see, this will all be worth it. It's. For. Your. Own. Good!\"\n\n  In the end they did manage to get the thing on me. Minus my toes and a part of my heel, of course. Everything my mother had been working for depended on me not breaking down as she and my sister walked me back to the parlour to show off. \n\nI made it twelve steps.\n\nWhen I recovered from the fainting the first thing I saw was Ella, sitting prim and proper in a chair as the Price slid the glass slipper effortlessly on her foot. They embraced and he took her arm as they left without a glance back. My blood was still on the glass.\n\nI did not dance at the wedding. Ella may have invited us to spite us as my Mother speculated. Or maybe she was just a better person than we all were. Nevertheless, I did not dance.\n\nI can not dance anymore, the daughter cut down to fit the mould of a Princess she was never meant to be.\n",

    "passage": "For me, it’s a guilty pleasure to waste time on Sunday morning reading the _New York Times_ wedding announcements.  I used to indulge myself in this habit to see if I knew any of the couples or went to the same schools they had attended.  Now, as I have gotten older, and have passed the age that is typical for first marriages, I find that I rarely know the people whose weddings are described in the announcements.  But I still read them, in part as a barometer of changes in marriage practices, which interest me as a feminist and a family law scholar.\n\nHow many, and which kinds of, women keep their names? How many retain their names professionally? How many couples have had previous marriages that ended in divorce?  At what age do people marry the first, second, or even third time?  And now, since the _Times_ made the decision a few years back to start including same-sex marriages, how many couples are made up of two men or two women?  And how do the marriage practices of same-sex couples vary from those of straight couples?\n\nNow, I have added another question to my completely unscientific, anecdotal wedding-data collection project: What type of officiant solemnized the marriage?  In the case of clergy (as opposed to judges, village justices, city clerks, and assorted other secular officials who might be authorized to conduct marriages in a particular jurisdiction), the announcements identify the officiant by both the name and the denomination:  A Jewish Rabbi, a Roman Catholic Priest, a Hindu Priest, a Presbyterian minister, and so on.\n\nThen there are those announcements that say something like this:  The couple was married by “a friend of the couple who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the event.”  Or by the Church of Spiritual Humanism, or by the American Marriage Ministries.  The number of marriages officiated by such ministers seems to be growing, and many of them take place in New York.  This is curious given that there is good reason to believe such officiants do not have the authority to solemnize marriages under New York marriage law.\n\nIn this, Part One of this two-part series of columns, I will explain the basic procedural requirements for marriage and the questions raised when weddings are presided over by ministers ordained online, who have no congregation or other trappings of religious power.\n\nThen, in Part Two—which will appear on Justia’s _Verdict_ in two weeks, on November 15—I will provide a detailed jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis of cases in which the validity of online-minister marriages have been challenged.  In that part, I will focus with special detail on New York, where, while online minister weddings are clearly common, there is case law suggesting that the resulting marriages are not valid.\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID MARRIAGE\n\nMarriage law, and especially marriage procedure, is governed by state law.  Every state has a set of statutes governing marriages—resolving questions such as who is eligible to marry, what procedures must be followed to create a marriage, and when and how marriages can be dissolved.\n\nTwo people who consent to marry and are eligible to marry—because they are not closely related, not already married to someone else, old enough, etc.—must still follow certain procedures to establish a valid marriage.  (About a dozen states also still recognize common-law marriage, which can be created by the agreement and consent of the parties, without a license or formal ceremony.)  The two basic requirements are a marriage license and the solemnization of the marriage by a valid officiant.\n\nTo apply for a license, couples generally need to provide proof of their age and identity.  Both parties also need to personally appear at the clerk’s office to apply for the license, unless special circumstances apply.  A blood test for syphilis or other communicable diseases used to be a standard part of the requirements for a marriage license, but most states have repealed these requirements.\n\nMost states also impose a waiting period of at least 24 hours after the couple applies for the license before the wedding can take place.  This waiting period can be waived in many jurisdictions, though.  The marriage license also has an expiration date: The wedding must take place within 30 or, in some states, 60 days or a new license must be sought.  And, a small fee must be paid.\n\nWith the marriage license in hand, couples can proceed to the next step: solemnization.  The statutes generally do not specify any necessary form or content for a wedding ceremony.  Neither The Wedding March nor Pachelbel’s Canon need be played while the bride is walking down the aisle.  Indeed, there doesn’t need to be an aisle at all, nor music for that matter.  The statutes specify only that a recognized officiant must preside over a ceremony during which the parties express their consent to marry and the officiant declares them to be married.  (Thus, the standard “I do” part of wedding ceremonies—or something close to it—is not just a nicety, but also a legal requirement.)\n\nThe ceremony must then be finalized by the signature of two witnesses and the officiant on a marriage certificate, which is then filed and kept as a public document.  Contrary to popular myth, the consummation of a marriage is not a formal requirement for a valid marriage to exist, although the inability to consummate can be grounds for an annulment.  And the Catholic Church treats the failure to consummate as an adequate basis for a canonical annulment, though that would have no effect on one’s civil marital status.\n\nWHO HAS THE POWER TO SOLEMNIZE MARRIAGES?\n\nWho can be an officiant at a marriage ceremony? All states allow an array of civil officers to solemnize marriages—mayors, judges, magistrates, court clerks, and others.  They also allow religious figures to solemnize civil marriages.  But who qualifies as an appropriate religious figure?  State statutes generally bestow the power to solemnize on “clergy,” referring to a category of persons that states define differently.  The most common definition of “clergy” or “minister” is an individual who has been ordained by a recognized religious body and has a congregation or following.\n\nMarriage officiant laws also reflect local idiosyncrasies.  In Ohio, for example, the “superintendent of the school for the deaf” can conduct weddings; in New York, leaders of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, a group that provides “non-theistic services in a congregational setting,” can perform marriages.  Many states specifically accommodate Quakers, who believe that every member is a minister, even though the members wouldn’t otherwise meet the typical definition of clergy.\n\nTHE UNIVERSAL LIFE CHURCH (ULC) AND ONLINE ORDINATIONS\n\nOne recurring question for courts has been whether ministers who have only been ordained through the mail, or more commonly today, on the Internet, count as “clergy”.  The answer has generally been that these ministers do not meet the standard definition of the term.\n\nThe largest supplier of online ordinations is the ULC, a non-denominational church founded in Modesto, California in 1962 that claims to have ordained more than 20 million ministers.  According to its own website, the ULC joins together ministers who “come from all walks of life and spiritual traditions”; their “common thread” is “adherence to the universal doctrine of religious freedom: Do only that which is right.”  There is no set doctrine for ministers to accept, nor is there a mandate that ministers must believe in God.  The ULC advocates “religious freedom,” and the pursuit of “spiritual beliefs without interference from any outside agency, including government or church authority.”\n\nIn the ULC, ordination is free, accomplished through a click on the website and the filling out of a short online form.  (Other clicks make possible online confessions and prayer requests.)  The ordination request then must be approved, which takes about 24 hours.\n\nI became a minister of the Universal Life Church while writing this column.  In a confirming e-mail, I was informed that my “ordination is for life, without price, and without question of [my] specific beliefs.” In the Church’s eyes, I am authorized to “perform all peaceful rites and ceremonies of the church, including weddings, funerals, baptisms, blessings, and to preach, teach and hold meetings” and “entitled to all privileges and courtesies normally offered to members of the clergy.”  I was offered (but not pressured) to buy various certificates, business cards, books and manuals, robes, stoles and other accoutrements to facilitate my ministerial activities.  The “complete ministry package” even includes a parking placard that says “Minister.”\n\nI was also asked to please note that I was not “ordained ‘by Internet’ or ‘online.’” The ULC, the e-mail explained, is a “regularly established church or congregation” and all ordinations are done as the deliberate, thoughtful, and responsible act of a human being, not by a computer.”  The Internet and e-mail were merely used, I was told, “[a]s is the case with nearly every church, organization and business,” for “administrative communications.”  I was told that it was also important for me to note that I did not ordain myself.\n\nARE MARRIAGES CONDUCTED BY MINISTERS WHO HAVE BEEN ORDAINED ONLINE VALID? A DIFFICULT QUESTION\n\nThe legal validity (or lack thereof) of marriages officiated by ULC ministers, or other similar churches, varies by jurisdiction.\n\nTake a 1988 case from Mississippi, _In re Will of Blackwell_. The case arose when siblings of Cobert Blackwell, who was then deceased, challenged Nadine Fortenberry’s claim for a widow’s elective share of Blackwell’s estate, claiming that Blackwell and Fortenberry’s marriage was invalid because it was solemnized by Claude Clark, a constable and Methodist with “Credentials of Ministry” from the ULC.\n\nAt the time the couple had married, Blackwell was a fifty-eight-year-old widower in Walthall County, Mississippi.  He and Nadine obtained a marriage license in November 1984, and, in the court’s words, the “next day, a Friday, our couple set sail for Jackson (of all places) in search of legal blessing for their bliss.”  They were referred by a local judge to Clark, who performed their marriage the following day.\n\nWhen Blackwell died less than three months later, his seven brothers and sisters stood to inherit everything except the share designated for a surviving spouse under Mississippi law.  They came up with the idea to challenge Clark’s credentials, and thus the validity of the marriage.  No marriage would mean no surviving spouse, and no spouse would mean no elective share for Nadine.\n\nUnder Mississippi law, only a minister, rabbi, or “other spiritual leader of any other religious body” could solemnize marriages in Mississippi.  The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the validity of the marriage.  While the majority conceded that the “ULC is hardly a conventional church by Bible Belt standards,” it was “enough of a religious body,” and Clark was “enough of a spiritual leader,” to validate the marriage.  (One justice concurred only in the result, criticizing the majority’s “enough of” standard as “horseshoe jurisprudence.”)\n\nBut courts in some other states have reached different conclusions.  The Virginia Supreme Court, for example, held in 1974, in _Cramer v. Commonwealth_, that the authority of a group of ULC ministers was rightfully rescinded by a lower court given that they did not meet the state’s definition of clergy.\n\nVirginia law requires that, in order to officiate at weddings, a minister must show “proof of ordination and of his being in regular communion with the religious society of which he is a reputed member.” This requirement, the court explained, is not a “religious test,” nor a way of encouraging church marriages.  It is, instead, designed to ensure that a “person of responsibility and integrity and by one possessed of some educational qualifications” would oversee the legal requirements for creating a valid marriage.\n\nMinisters are delegated this power based on the assumption that, in any church, the selection of ministers is a “considered, deliberate and responsible act.”  But the ULC encourages all members to be ministers, and, in this court’s view, a “church which consists of all ministers, and in which all new converts can become instant ministers, in fact has no ‘minister’ within the contemplation of [state marriage law].”  The legislature never “intended to qualify, for licensing to marry, a minister whose title and status could be so casually and cavalierly acquired.”\n\nIn Part Two of this series for Justia’s _Verdict_, I will continue looking at cases involving the validity of ULC marriages, with a special focus on the vulnerability of such marriages in the state of New York.\n\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download\n",
    "question": "What does the text say about the common requirements for a civil marriage?",
    "answer_human": "The basic requirements are simple. Two eligible people need to express their desire to marry with at least two witnesses present. The eligibility requirement is about not being close relatives, not being already married, and being old enough. This ceremony can be officiated by various groups of people; mayors, judges, magistrates, court clerks, and more. Religious figures are also empowered to officiate religious ceremonies. The usual definition of clergy is an individual ordained by a recognized religious body and has a congregation or following. The couple needs to apply for a marriage license with proof of age and identity and perform the ceremony within a specified time period (usually 30 days but sometimes 60). There is a customary period of a day between the application for a license and the allowance to perform the ceremony, but that can usually be waived. The ceremony is finalized with the signing of the marriage certificate by the witnesses and the officiant.",

    "passage": "TEAM REMY'S FIRST ADVENTURE\n\n_On the trail of Gulch and Salem, Ruby's ragtag group finds danger as well as friendship_\n\n_[Author's note: This story follows_ Team REMY_, which in turn follows_ Ruby's Date Story_.]_\n\nThe four of them had arranged to meet outside the cafe. Ruby could have easily walked there from the guesthouse where she was staying but when Yatsuhashi offered to pick her up on his bike she agreed immediately. She was trying to ignore how she felt whenever she was around him – but, damn, it was hard. And after seeing him holding Coco's baby, so gentle and calm, well, that just made everything worse. Of maybe better, it depended on how you looked at it.\n\nShe had not forgotten what Coco had said, that he had covertly organised to spend time with her, on the trip to visit Coco and Fox. That was a good sign, a very good sign, she thought. The trouble was that she didn't know what to do now. But at the moment she was delighted to be on the back of the bike, arms around him, head on his shoulder, feeling ... oh my.\n\nThey reached the cafe and, rather reluctantly, she jumped off. Edward came up to them. Aside from his backpack he was carrying an armful of books.\n\n\"I thought these might come in handy,\" he said. \"I've looked through them a bit and there are several mentions of Almira Gulch.\"\n\n\"Are they from the Beacon Academy library?\" said Ruby.\n\n\"No, they're ... sort of from a private collection.\"\n\n\"Do I want to know whose collection?\"\n\n\"Probably not.\"\n\nRuby sighed. \"Well, I guess someone with a talent for procurement is a team asset,\" she said.\n\nMelanie arrived. Except that her car wasn't a car. It was more like some sort of modified military vehicle, armoured and with a hatch in the roof.\n\n\"What the hell is this?\" said Edward.\n\n\"It sort of hums, so I call it Hummer,\" said Melanie.\n\n\"Should call it Clanker,\" muttered Yatsuhashi. He lifted the bike onto a rack at the back of the vehicle.\n\nThey loaded their supplies and climbed in. Yatsuhashi was too big to fit in the front so he sat in the back, with Ruby.\n\n\"Where to?\" said Melanie.\n\n\"The castle where Gulch took Coco,\" said Ruby. \"We searched it before but it was pretty quick. With more time, we might find some clues as to where she has gone. With her pet.\"\n\nBefore long, they were zooming through the countryside. If Melanie had ever heard of safe driving she gave little sign of it. Rather than watch the series of near-misses Ruby looked through the books Edward had brought. Yes, there were numerous mentions of Gulch, and stories of the conflict between her and Salem. Salem was, it appeared, the more powerful of the two but Gulch was tough, cunning, and patient. And now she had her enemy on a leash, with the aim of somehow joining her power to her own.\n\n_No way that can be good_, thought Ruby.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven Melanie accepted that driving through the wilderness at night was a poor idea, so they stopped to make camp. Edward, using only a few basic ingredients and a campfire, produced a large and wonderful meal.\n\n\"This is great,\" said Ruby.\n\n\"It's ... alright, I guess,\" said Melanie.\n\n\"I will have yours, then,\" said Yatsuhashi, reaching for her plate.\n\nShe slapped his hand away. \"I didn't say I wouldn't eat it,\" she said. \"Girl's got to have something to sustain her, after all.\"\n\n\"Are you always such a bitch?\" said Edward to Melanie.\n\n\"Consistently.\"\n\n\"How did you make something so good?\" said Ruby to Edward. \"Magic?\"\n\n\"Practice,\" he said.\n\nMelanie grimaced. \"You Hunters and your magic stuff,\" she said. \"You guys think you're so great with all your fancy weapons and your Semblances and things. The rest of us have to work for a living, you know. Pay the bills, get through the day, and avoid the crossfire from you idiots.\"\n\nRuby stared at her. \"Wh ... what?\" she said. \"I ... always thought that people liked the Hunters. We fight against evil, after all.\"\n\nMelanie shrugged. \"More likely, you attract it,\" she said. \"Maybe you just like the glamour and the funny clothes and the applause you get from each other. Well, I didn't see any of you guys putting it on the line when Mil and I got cornered in an alley by a bunch of Salem's wolf things, in Vale that night.\"\n\n\"We ... were busy,\" said Ruby, knowing that it sounded ... lame. She looked at Yatsuhashi. \"Is ... is she right?\" she said. \"Do ordinary people not like us?\"\n\nHe grunted. \"Some do, some don't,\" he said. \"But being a Hunter is not a choice. It is a destiny, whether you want it or not.\"\n\n\"Humph,\" said Melanie. \"Then I guess it must have been my destiny to be a bouncer, and after that a waitress.\"\n\n\"Could have been worse,\" put in Edward. \"Try life in a kitchen.\"\n\n\"Speaking of weapons,\" said Ruby, \"what do you have, Melanie?\"\n\n\"Armoured boots with extendable blades,\" she said. \"Made them myself. Here, take a look.\" She took one off and handed it to Ruby, who examined it.\n\n\"Wow,\" said Ruby, handing the boot back. \"That is really great. Meeting a new weapon is better than meeting a new person. But Hunters aren't just their weapons. Glynda, for example, has a riding crop, but it isn't really a weapon. It just helps her to focus and direct the power she has inside her.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Edward. \"So that's what that thing is.\"\n\n\"Magic shmagic,\" said Melanie. \"Aside from the boots, I've also got this.\" She held up a massive pump-action shotgun, military in style. \"I used to have a boyfriend in the Atlas army,\" she said. \"That's how I got the car, too. And this, for close encounters.\" She took a hatchet from a holster at her waist. \"What have you got?\"\n\nRuby took out Crescent Rose and extended it into its full, remarkable length.\n\n\"Whoa,\" said Melanie. \"That's ... interesting.\" Ruby retracted the weapon into its carry-case.\n\n\"You?\" said Yatsuhashi to Edward.\n\n\"This,\" said Edward. He held up his cast-iron frypan, twirled it. The others sighed.\n\n\"Well, I guess now we sleep,\" said Melanie. \"I'm taking the front seat of the car. I don't care what you guys do.\"\n\n\"I'll take the back seat,\" said Edward.\n\n\"I have a sleeping bag,\" said Yatsuhashi. \"But only one.\"\n\n\"We ... can share again,\" said Ruby. \"If ... you don't mind.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said Yatsuhashi.\n\nSo they all settled themselves down, with Yatsuhashi and Ruby squeezed together.\n\nRuby gulped. \"We ... we might be more comfortable,\" she said, \"if you put your arm around me.\"\n\nHe grunted. Then he put his arm around her. \"Like that?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" she said. \"Just like that. Yatsu, what you said before, about destiny. Did you want to become a Hunter?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" he said. \"What I wanted to do, when I was young, was work on my father's farm, with my brothers and sisters. Grow things. Eventually meet someone and start a family of my own, perhaps. But then it became clear that I had the Aura. So I was sent to train.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Ruby. \"I ... I'm sorry. I didn't know that ... it had been like that for you.\"\n\n\"I am not sorry,\" he said. \"For the path has led me here. To you. I would not wish to be anywhere else.\"\n\nShe smiled her secret smile. \"Me too,\" she said. She snuggled against his massive body and fell asleep, dreaming pleasant dreams.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe castle seemed to be deserted. They inspected the chamber that Coco had shot to pieces and eventually located the hidden catch that opened the door through which Gulch had escaped. It led to a flight of stone steps that took them into a courtyard. On the other side of the courtyard was a small stone building, like a crypt.\n\n\"If I was an evil witch, that would appeal to me,\" said Melanie.\n\nBut then they heard a noise – like scraping hooves. Coming into the courtyard.\n\n\"Oh no,\" muttered Ruby. \"I certainly hope that that isn't – \"\n\nIt was. It shook itself, as if waking from a slumber. It stopped in front of the crypt.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" said Edward.\n\n\"Nucklelavee,\" said Yatsuhashi, drawing his sword. \"Very dangerous, very tough. Even by Grimm standards.\"\n\n\"Watch out for its arms, they stretch and have claws,\" said Ruby, as she extended her scythe. \"And it can spin around very quickly.\"\n\n\"Right, stretchy arms, claws, spin, got it,\" said Edward, taking out his frypan.\n\n\"It will probably attack by using its arms like lances,\" said Ruby. \"When it does, Edward and I go right, Yatsu and Melanie go left. We close in from both sides at once. Clear?\" She glanced at Melanie. \"Clear?\" she repeated.\n\nBut Melanie was merely staring at the Nucklelavee. \"I – I – I – I couldn't ... \" she stammered.\n\nAnd then the Nucklelavee's arms shot out.\n\n\"Move!\" shouted Ruby. She leaped, as did Yatsuhashi. But Melanie remained frozen. A claw was zooming towards her.\n\nThere was a t_hunk_! The claw whacked into Edward's frypan, and bounced off. He had jumped in the way with it.\n\nThe other arm speared towards him. He wielded the frypan again, blocking it.\n\nRuby and Yatsuhashi were running, charging, on either side, taking advantage of the Grimm's distraction.\n\nOnce more, the Nucklelavee tried to hit Melanie. And again Edward blocked it. He raised his arm – and a blast of energy shot from his elbow. It whacked into the Nucklelavee, and through it. The Grimm screamed in pain. But then the wound healed. It retracted its arms and turned to face Yatsuhashi.\n\nOne arm whipped towards him. He swung his sword, slicing into the arm. But the wound fused immediately, and the clawed hand punched out. Yatsuhashi went down, sliding backwards along the ground.\n\nRuby was in the air, swinging Crescent Rose. But the Nucklelavee was moving, out of the path of the blade. Its arm caught her, and flung her. She landed with a painful thump next to Yatsuhashi.\n\n\"This is going well, I think,\" she said, as they struggled to their feet. \"In the sense that we are not dead yet.\"\n\nYatsuhashi grunted. \"Do you know how we kill it?\" he said.\n\n\"The last one, we pinned its arms and cut its head off,\" she said. \"Not exactly easy, though. Hmm, it seems to be staying in front of the crypt. As if it's protecting it. Not letting us in.\"\n\n\"Instructions from Gulch, perhaps.\"\n\n\"And all the more reason for us to take a look.\"\n\nThe Nucklelavee's arms came swinging towards them, one on each side. Ruby and Yatsuhashi parried, slicing into the black flesh – but with little lasting effect. The Nucklelavee fell back a few steps, as if it was wary of their weapons.\n\n\"I have an idea,\" she said. She told him what she had in mind.\n\n\"That is very dangerous,\" said Yatsuhashi.\n\n\"I am open to other suggestions.\"\n\nYatsuhashi grunted.\n\nRuby called to Edward: \"When I signal, give it one of your energy shots.\"\n\n\"The last one wasn't effective,\" he called back. \"But I will.\" He was still standing in front of Melanie, frypan up.\n\nYatsuhashi started to run, as if he was going to attack the horse-head of the Nucklelavee. At the same moment, Ruby began to run up the wall, pivoting on the scythe, aiming to get behind and above the creature.\n\nThe Nucklelavee swung an arm towards each of them.\n\nYatsuhashi threw his sword, just as Ruby threw the scythe. But the Nucklelavee flipped backwards, avoiding both.\n\n\"Now!\" shouted Ruby.\n\nEdward fired, the energy bolt hitting the Grimm in the face. For a moment, it was distracted.\n\nAnd then Ruby caught Yatsuhashi's sword. In mid-air, she swivelled and slashed out. She landed on the ground, crouched.\n\nFor a long moment, there was only silence. And then the head of the Nucklelavee slowly toppled from its body. The Grimm began to evaporate into ashes.\n\nYatsuhashi helped Ruby up. She handed him his sword, and he picked up Crescent Rose and handed it to her. \"Good,\" he said. \"Very good.\"\n\nShe smiled. They went over to Edward and Melanie. \"Nice shot at the right time,\" said Ruby to Edward.\n\n\"Elbow,\" said Yatsuhashi. For a moment, it almost seemed that he might laugh ... but he didn't.\n\nRuby turned to Melanie. She was white, and shaking. \"I ... I ... \" she said.\n\n\"It's alright,\" said Ruby. \"Nucklelavees are pretty scary.\"\n\n\"You don't understand!\" cried Melanie. \"I couldn't save her! I fought and I fought and I couldn't save her! We fought as hard as we could and it wasn't enough! It just wasn't enough! And now I've lost her! She's dead!\"\n\nRuby took her in her arms. \"I know,\" she said softly. \"I know.\"\n\nMelanie wept. And wept. There was nothing the others could do except let her cry.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe crypt was like a workshop for dark magic, with books and talismans lying about in disarray. Gulch had obviously left quickly.\n\nAnd there was a map. They studied it.\n\n\"I would say that this is Gulch's usual base,\" said Ruby, pointing to a castle marked with a large insignia. \"In Winkie County.\"\n\n\"And where is Winkie County?\" said Melanie.\n\n\"It's mentioned in one of Edward's books,\" said Ruby. \"On the other side of the Borderlands, and then some. Long way, dangerous territory.\"\n\n\"You think that Salem would be there?\"\n\n\"Most likely.\"\n\n\"Then let's go.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Yatsuhashi. \"Our mission was to find out where Gulch and Salem are. With this material, we have done that.\"\n\n\"So you think that we should report back to Glynda, receive a pat on the back, and then go home?\" said Edward.\n\n\"Not what I said,\" said Yatsuhashi.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, Salem has to pay for ... Militia,\" said Melanie.\n\n\"I have a debt to collect as well,\" said Yatsuhashi.\n\n\"Me too,\" said Ruby. \"And I would like to have a serious talk with Gulch about threatening babies.\"\n\n\"So ... I'm the only one not on a revenge binge, eh?\" said Edward.\n\n\"You don't have to come any further,\" said Ruby. \"You've done your part, and done it well.\"\n\n\"Not what I said,\" said Edward. \"Anyway, you might need a cook.\"\n\nRuby was collecting maps and books to add to their stock. \"Yes,\" she said. \"No doubt we will.\"\n\nEND\n",

She studied drama at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna.[2] For her work in Maren Ade's film Everyone Else she won Silver Bear for Best Actress at 59th Berlin International Film Festival. She is the only Austrian actress to win this award in history of the festival and the first Austrian actress to win best actress award at a major European film festival (Cannes, Venice, Berlin) since 1956. She worked with several major European directors including Michael Haneke, Tom Tykwer and Jessica Hausner.\n\n\nCareer\n\nMinichmayr had her first break with the Burgtheater in Vienna, where she appeared in numerous plays, including _Der Reigen_ by Arthur Schnitzler (staged by Sven-Eric Bechtolf), _Troilus and Cressida_ by William Shakespeare (staging by Declan Donnellan) and _Der Färber und sein Zwillingsbruder_ by Johann Nestroy (staged by Karlheinz Hackl). She made her cinema debut in 2000 as Barbara Brecht in Jan Schütte's _Abschied_, playing alongside Josef Bierbichler and Monica Bleibtreu. In 2000, Minichmayr appeared in Peter Sämann's television thriller (in the _Tatort_ series), “Böses Blut”. She was awarded the Austrian Nestroy Prize for “Best Young Talent” in 2000. In 2006 she played Mizzi Kasper, one of the lovers from Crownprince Rudolf in the movie __. A year later, Minichmayr played the fool in Luc Bondy's acclaimed staging of Shakespeare's _King Lear_, always at the Burgtheater.\n\nMinichmayr currently lives in Munich and Vienna. She speaks English and has acted in several international and English language productions. Among the directors she worked with were István Szabó, Götz Spielmann, Tom Tykwer, Oliver Hirschbiegel, Robert Dornhelm, and Doris Dörrie. She is also an accomplished vocalist, and has been recorded several times, though she has always made acting her primary focus.\n\nAt the 59th Berlin International Film Festival 2009 Minichmayr was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress for her performance in Maren Ade's _Alle Anderen_ (Everyone Else).\n\n\nFilmography\n\n  ------ --------------------------------------------- --------------------- ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------\n  DATE   FILM                                          ROLE                  DIRECTOR                     NOTES\n  2000   _Abschied_                                    Barbara Brecht        Jan Schütte                  \n  2000   _Tatort - Böses Blut_                         Kathi                 Peter Sämann                 TV film - Awarded Nestroy Prize for _Best Young Talent_\n  2001   _Taking Sides_                                Emmi Straube          István Szabó                 \n  2001   _Spiel im Morgengrauen_                       Steffi                Götz Spielmann               TV film\n  2002   _Liegen Lernen_                               Tina                  Hendrik Handloeghten         \n  2004   _Hotel_                                       Petra                 Jessica Hausner              \n  2004   _Downfall_                                    Gerda Christian       Oliver Hirschbiegel          \n  2004   _Spiele Leben_                                Tanja                 Antonin Svoboda              \n  2004   _Daniel Käfer - Die Villen der Frau Hürsch_   Mirz Schlömmer        Julian Pölsner               TV film\n  2005   _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer_            Grenouille's Mother   Tom Tykwer                   \n  2005   _Fallen_                                      Brigitte              Barbara Albert               \n  2006   _Krankheit der Jugend_                                              Students of Michael Haneke   \n  2006   __                                            Mizzi Kasper          Robert Dornhelm              TV film\n  2006   _Polizeiruf 110 - Kellers Kind_               Aglaia                Titus Selge                  TV film\n  2007   _Midsummer Madness_                           Maja                  Alexander Hahn               \n  2008   _Kirschblüten - Hanami_                       Karolin Angermeier    Doris Dörrie                 \n  2009   _Der Knochenmann_                             Birgit                Wolfgang Murnberger          \n  2009   _The White Ribbon_                            Frieda                Michael Haneke               \n  2009   _Everyone Else_                               Gitti                 Maren Ade                    \n  2012   _Mercy_                                       Maria                 Matthias Glasner             \n  2014   _Eine Liebe für den Frieden_                  Berthe Von Suttner    Urs Egger                    \n  2015   _Jack_                                                                                           \n  2017   _Animals_                                                                                        \n  ------ --------------------------------------------- --------------------- ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAwards\n\n-   2000: Nestroy Prize for Best Young Talent\n-   2004/2009: Nestroy Prize for Best Actress[3][4]\n-   2009: 59th Berlin International Film Festival, Best Actress for Everyone Else\n-   2010: German Film Awards, Nomination Best Actress for Everyone Else\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n",

    "passage": "Port of Galveston\n\nThe PORT OF GALVESTON is the port of the city of Galveston, Texas. It was established by a proclamation issued by the Congress of Mexico on October 17, 1825, while the land known today as Texas was still part of Mexico. The Port of Galveston is the oldest port in the Gulf of Mexico west of New Orleans.[1]\n\n\nOverview\n\n[Cranes at the Port of Galveston container terminal] Located on the upper Texas coast on the eastern end of Galveston Island, it is from the open Gulf or approximately 30 minutes sailing time. The port is municipally owned by the City of Galveston and is managed by the Board of Trustees of the Galveston Wharves, as designated by the City Charter. The port is self-sustaining, and does not receive any taxpayer funding.[2] The Port of Galveston consists of the Galveston Ship Channel, the south side of Pelican Island, the north side of Galveston Island, and the entrance to Galveston Bay. The Galveston Channel has an authorized minimum depth of [3] and is wide at its narrowest point.\n\nThe port has 15-20 lines of business.[4]\n\nIn 2015, the eastern section of the port, ending at Pier 38, was dredged to a depth of . Siltation occurred at a faster than expected pace, requiring more dredging in 2016. The western part of the port will be dredged from a dept of to , at a cost of $12–15 million.[5] To accommodate cruise ships, the area where the ships turn around is routinely dredged every four years.[6]\n\n\nHistory\n\n[Postcard depicting people loading cotton at Galveston Wharfs & Harbor, undated]\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the port was the busiest on the Gulf Coast and considered to be second busiest in the country, next to the port of New York City.[7] In the 1850s, the port of Galveston exported approximately goods valued almost 20 times what was imported. The main export was cotton.[8] The Galveston Wharf Company took control of the port in 1869.[9] They built a grain elevator in 1875, leading Galveston to become a major grain exporter over the next few decades.[10] By 1878, the port of Galveston was the nation's 3rd largest cotton exporter; they fell to 5th by 1882.[11] Galveston's wealth and great esteem was due in large part to the port's activity.[12] As other areas of the United States began to transition to a more industrial economy, Galveston was unable to compete. The port continued to primarily export agricultural goods. Local leaders often blamed the lack of industrial goods to export on the city's lack of an adequate water supply. However, when the city water project finished in the early 1890s, industrialization still did not occur. In reality, many companies were hesitant to invest in machinery on an island prone to floods.[13][14] The nearby city of Houston was able to better attract industry and began positioning themselves as a viable alternative to Galveston.[15]\n\nThe port survived the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 relatively unscathed, but the railroad connecting the island to the mainland suffered significant damage.[16] In response to the hurricane, city leaders dredged the ship channel to raise the island's grade. As a result, the port was now considered a deep-water port and was able to handle larger ships.[17] By the time World War I began, Galveston “was the leading cotton port in the world, the third-largest exporter of wheat, and an important sugar import center.”[18] The port also became a major immigration center, with almost 50,000 people entering the country between 1906 and 1914.[19]\n\nIn March 1920 local longshoreman called for a strike, seeking a wage increase and recognition of their union, the International Longshoreman's Association. Some of the port traffic was diverted to the Port of Port Arthur. Some businesses threatened to pull out of Galveston completely if the port wasn't reopened. Governor William P. Hobby declared martial law and sent the Texas National Guard to take control of the city and the port. The city was under martial law until January 1921, when the longshoreman agreed to return to work for a salary increase that was less than they had sought.[20]\n\nLater that decade, the port of Galveston became a major sulphur exporter.[21] As the oil industry expanded in Texas, no pipelines were built to Galveston.[22]\n\nThe Intracoastal Canal opened in 1933.[23]\n\nFor several years in the 1990s, port officials attempted to lure modern cruise ships to Galveston. Their efforts paid off in 2000. On September 30, the Carnival Cruise Lines ship _Celebration_ debarked from the port of Galveston. The long _Celebration_, and other ships based in Galveston in the first few years, were small and older.[24] Over the next 16 years, the port invested more than $85 million to build and improve facilities to accommodate these ships.[25] Princess declined to sail from Galveston after the 2007 season.[26]\n\nHurricane Ike hit the Texas Gulf Coast in 2008, causing major damage to the port. The cruise terminals were closed for several months, forcing Carnival to use the Bayport Cruise Terminal temporarily.[27]\n\nAt Carnival's behest, the port embarked on major improvements to Terminal 1 in 2010. The terminal was expanded to provide more seating, restrooms, and security screening stations.[28][29] In 2011, Carnival added a second year-round ship in Galveston, the _Carnival Triumph_, increasing their capacity by 40%. The following year, Carnival transferred the _Carnival Magic_, to Galveston, marking the first time that a cruise line had based its newest ship at this port.[30] Both Princess Cruise Lines and Disney Cruise Lines stationed ships in Galveston for the winter season in 2012-2013.[31] From 2014 to 2015, the cruise business expanded substantially, adding an additional 400,000 passengers.[32]\n\nIn order to lure larger ships, carrying up to 5,000 passengers, the port renovated and expanded Terminal 2.[33] A new building was constructed on the foundations of an 80-year-old silo and then connected to the original Terminal 2.[34] The port's contract with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines specified that the work would be completed before the _Liberty of the Seas_ was repositioned to Galveston. Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival expressed public displeasure when the project was delayed multiple times. One delay was due to a redesign required when engineers discovered the work area had sandier soil than expected and would thus require a more sturdy foundation. The construction area was thought to be the location of a sunk Texas Navy warship, requiring archaeological analysis before construction could begin.[35]\n\n\nCargo\n\nThe port is equipped to handle all types of cargo including containers, dry and liquid bulk, breakbulk, RO/RO, refrigerated, and project cargoes. The Galveston Railroad, a terminal switching railroad, facilitates movement of cargo by rail.[36]\n\nDel Monte uses one wharf to import bananas.[37] In April 2016, a new vehicle distribution center for BMW Group was opened at the port. This was the result of a public-private partnership that the port entered into with Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics Vehicle Services Americas.[38] The new site has the capacity to import 32,500 cars per year, an inventory worth more than $1.3 billion.[39]\n\n\nPassengers\n\n[The cruise industry has become a major source of operating revenue for the Port of Galveston] As of 2018, Galveston is the 4th-busiest cruise ship homeport in North America[40] and one of the top 10 homeports in the world.[41] Over the years, the port has welcomed ships from major cruise lines including Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Disney Cruise Lines, and Norwegian Cruise Lines.[42] In 2018, three Carnival ships and two Royal Caribbean ships call the port home year-round, while Disney operates one ship for limited sailings. An estimated 1 million cruise passengers will sail from the port in 2018, a nine percent increase over 2017.[43] A 2015 economic analysis estimated that cruise passengers injected $56 million per year into the local Galveston economy, an average of $62 per passenger.[44]\n\nThere are two dedicated cruise terminals. Unlike many other ports, the cruise terminals are not used for other activities, such as conferences or corporate events.[45] Terminal 1 was expanded and improved in 2010, as a condition of Carnival Cruise Line placing their then-newest ship, the _Carnival Magic_ at the port.[46][47] Terminal 2 was expanded in 2016 to accommodate Royal Caribbean's desire to base their larger _Freedom_-class ships in Galveston.[48][49] The new facility can accommodate up to 5,000 passengers and allows for simultaneous handling of passengers embarking and disembarking.[50] Port officials have earmarked $100,000 for the design of a third terminal, but are waiting for definitive interest from a cruise line before beginning work.[51]\n\nThe port receives fees of $11–$26 per cruise ship passenger, depending on whether port employees are responsible for tying the ship down, or for paying the harbor pilots responsible for bringing the ships into the port.[52] Cruises account for approximately 60% of the port's revenues.[53]\n\nUnlike other cruise ports in the United States, the port of Galveston can be affected by fog, particularly in late December, January, and February. This can delay the ships' return to port.[54] Beginning in 2014, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission began collecting taxes from returning cruise passengers on any alcohol and cigarettes they had purchased onboard or in foreign ports.[55]\n\n\nOther revenue streams\n\nMuch of the port's profit comes from parking fees.[56] Approximately two-thirds of Galveston cruise passengers drive to the port.[57] The port operates a large parking lot for cruise passengers to leave their cars.[58] It also charges an access fee for private operators to enter the cruise terminal area to pick up or drop off passengers. Several parking operators sued the port over these fees. In January 2017, the United States Federal Maritime Commission unanimously upheld the port's right to charge them.[59]\n\nIn February 2016, the port completed construction on the Galveston Downtown Transit Terminal. Designed to “connect the port to the city itself”, the facility contains a shopping center and parking.[60]\n\n[1] Handbook of Texas: Galveston Wharves\n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] Wright-Gidley and Marines, p. 87\n\n[8] \n\n[9] McComb, p. 168.\n\n[10] McComb, p. 49.\n\n[11] McComb, p. 47.\n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] McComb, p, 48.\n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] Wright-Gidley and Marines, p. 88.\n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] McComb, p. 167.\n\n[21] McComb, p. 168.\n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] Handbook of Texas: Galveston Railway\n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n\n[47] \n\n[48] \n\n[49] \n\n[50] \n\n[51] \n\n[52] \n\n[53] \n\n[54] \n\n[55] \n\n[56] \n\n[57] \n\n[58] \n\n[59] \n\n[60] \n",

    "passage": "Level: Basic\n\n-   In the Bible, Jews were called Hebrews or Children of Israel\n-   The terms \"Jew\" and \"Judaism\" come from the tribe or kingdom of Judah\n-   \"Jew\" now refers to all physical and spiritual descendants of Jacob\n-   A person can be Jewish by birth or by conversion\n-   Traditionally, Jewish status passes through the mother, not the father\n\n\nOrigins of the Words \"Jew\" and \"Judaism\"\n\nThe original name for the people we now call Jews was Hebrews. The word \"Hebrew\" (in Hebrew, \"Ivri\") is first used in the Torah to describe Abraham (Gen. 14:13). The word is apparently derived from the name Eber, one of Abraham's ancestors. Another tradition teaches that the word comes from the word \"eyver,\" which means \"the other side,\" referring to the fact that Abraham came from the other side of the Euphrates, or referring to the fact Abraham was separated from the other nations morally and spiritually.\n\nAnother name used for the people is Children of Israel or Israelites, which refers to the fact that the people are descendants of Jacob, who was also called Israel.\n\nThe word \"Jew\" (in Hebrew, \"Yehudi\") is derived from the name Judah, which was the name of one of Jacob's twelve sons. Judah was the ancestor of one of the tribes of Israel, which was named after him. Likewise, the word Judaism literally means \"Judah-ism,\" that is, the religion of the Yehudim. Other sources, however, say that the word \"Yehudim\" means \"People of G-d,\" because the first three letters of \"Yehudah\" are the same as the first three letters of G-d's four-letter name.\n\nOriginally, the term Yehudi referred specifically to members of the tribe of Judah, as distinguished from the other tribes of Israel. However, after the death of King Solomon, the nation of Israel was split into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel (I Kings 12; II Chronicles 10). After that time, the word Yehudi could properly be used to describe anyone from the kingdom of Judah, which included the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Levi, as well as scattered settlements from other tribes. The most obvious biblical example of this usage is in Esther 2:5, where Mordecai is referred to as both a Yehudi and a member of the tribe of Benjamin.\n\nIn the 6th century B.C.E., the kingdom of Israel was conquered by Assyria and the ten tribes were exiled from the land (II Kings 17), leaving only the tribes in the kingdom of Judah remaining to carry on Abraham's heritage. These people of the kingdom of Judah were generally known to themselves and to other nations as Yehudim (Jews), and that name continues to be used today.\n\nIn common speech, the word \"Jew\" is used to refer to all of the physical and spiritual descendants of Jacob/Israel, as well as to the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac and their wives, and the word \"Judaism\" is used to refer to their beliefs. Technically, this usage is inaccurate, just as it is technically inaccurate to use the word \"Indian\" to refer to the original inhabitants of the Americas. However, this technically inaccurate usage is common both within the Jewish community and outside of it, and is therefore used throughout this site.\n\nA Jew is any person whose mother was a Jew or any person who has gone through the formal process of conversion to Judaism.\n\nIt is important to note that being a Jew has nothing to do with what you believe or what you do. A person born to non-Jewish parents who has not undergone the formal process of conversion but who believes everything that Orthodox Jews believe and observes every law and custom of Judaism is still a non-Jew, even in the eyes of the most liberal movements of Judaism, and a person born to a Jewish mother who is an atheist and never practices the Jewish religion is still a Jew, even in the eyes of the ultra-Orthodox. In this sense, Judaism is more like a nationality than like other religions, and being Jewish is like a citizenship. See What Is Judaism?\n\nThis has been established since the earliest days of Judaism. In the Torah, you will see many references to \"the strangers who dwell among you\" or \"righteous proselytes\" or \"righteous strangers.\" These are various classifications of non-Jews who lived among Jews, adopting some or all of the beliefs and practices of Judaism without going through the formal process of conversion and becoming Jews. Once a person has converted to Judaism, he is not referred to by any special term; he is as much a Jew as anyone born Jewish.\n\nAlthough all Jewish movements agree on these general principles, there are occasional disputes as to whether a particular individual is a Jew. Most of these disputes fall into one of two categories.\n\nFirst, traditional Judaism maintains that a person is a Jew if his mother is a Jew, regardless of who his father is. The liberal movements, on the other hand, allow Jewish status to pass through the mother or the father if the child identifies as Jewish. For example, former Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, who had a Jewish father but chooses not to be identified as Jewish, would not be Jewish according to the Reform movement, but former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who had a Jewish father and adopted a Jewish identity as an adult, would be considered Jewish. See their position here). On the other hand, the child of a Christian father and a Jewish mother who does not publicly identify himself as Jewish would be considered Jewish according to the Orthodox movement, but not according to the Reform movement. Actor Harrison Ford would fit into this category: his mother's parents were Jewish, but he does not particularly consider himself to be of any religion, so Orthodox would count him toward a minyan if he showed up for services. The matter becomes even more complicated, because the status of that interfaith child's children also comes into question. Suppose a woman was born to a Jewish father and Christian mother and was raised in a Reform congregation always understanding herself to be completely Jewish. As an adult, she wants to marry a Conservative man only to find out that she has to convert so their children would be Jewish by Conservative standards!\n\nSecond, the more traditional movements do not always acknowledge the validity of conversions by the more liberal movements. A more liberal movement might not follow the procedures required by the more traditional movement, thereby invalidating the conversion. For example, Orthodoxy requires acceptance of the yoke of Torah (observance of Jewish law as Orthodoxy understands it), while other movements would not teach the same laws that Orthodoxy does and might not require observance. The Conservative movement requires circumcision and immersion in a mikvah, which is not always required in Reform conversions.\n\n\nAbout Matrilineal Descent\n\nMany people have asked me why traditional Judaism uses matrilineal descent to determine Jewish status, when in all other things (tribal affiliation, priestly status, royalty, etc.) we use patrilineal descent.\n\nThe Torah does not specifically state anywhere that matrilineal descent should be used; however, there are several passages in the Torah where it is understood that the child of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man is a Jew, and several other passages where it is understood that the child of a non-Jewish woman and a Jewish man is not a Jew.\n\nIn Deuteronomy 7:1-5, in expressing the prohibition against intermarriage, G-d says \"he [i.e., the non-Jewish male spouse] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods of others.\" No such concern is expressed about the child of a non-Jewish female spouse. From this, we infer that the child of a non-Jewish male spouse is Jewish (and can therefore be turned away from Judaism), but the child of a non-Jewish female spouse is not Jewish (and therefore turning away is not an issue).\n\nLeviticus 24:10 speaks of the son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man as being \"among the community of Israel\" (i.e., a Jew).\n\nOn the other hand, in Ezra 10:2-3, the Jews returning to Israel vowed to put aside their non-Jewish wives and the children born to those wives. They could not have put aside those children if those children were Jews.\n\nSeveral people have written to me asking about King David: was he a Jew, given that one of his female ancestors, Ruth, was not a Jew? This conclusion is based on two faulty premises: first of all, Ruth was a Jew, and even if she wasn't, that would not affect David's status as a Jew. Ruth converted to Judaism before marrying Boaz and bearing Obed. See Ruth 1:16, where Ruth states her intention to convert. After Ruth converted, she was a Jew, and all of her children born after the conversion were Jewish as well. But even if Ruth were not Jewish at the time Obed was born, that would not affect King David's status as a Jew, because Ruth is an ancestor of David's father, not of David's mother, and David's Jewish status is determined by his mother.\n\n\nAbout the Agudath Ha-Rabonim Statement\n\nIn March, 1997, the Agudath Ha-Rabonim issued a statement declaring that the Conservative and Reform movements are \"outside of Torah and outside of Judaism.\" This statement was widely publicized and widely misunderstood, and requires some response. Three points are particularly worth discussing: 1) the statement does not challenge the Jewish status of Reform and Conservative Jews; 2) the statement is not an official statement of a unified Orthodox opinion; 3) the statement was made with the intent of bringing people into Jewish belief, not with the intention of excluding them from it.\n\nFirst of all, the Agudath Ha-Rabonim statement does _NOT_ say that Reform and Conservative Jews are not Jews. Their statement does not say anything about Jewish status. As the discussion above explains, status as a Jew has nothing to do with what you believe; it is simply a matter of who your parents are. Reform and Conservative Jews _ARE_ Jews, as they have always been, and even the Agudath Ha-Rabonim would agree on that point. The debate over who is a Jew is the same as it has always been, the same as was discussed above: the Reform recognition of patrilineal decent, and the validity of conversions performed by non-Orthodox rabbis.\n\nSecond, the Agudath Ha-Rabonim is not the official voice of mainstream Orthodoxy. Their statement does not represent the unified position of Orthodox Judaism in America. In fact, the Rabbinical Council of America (the rabbinic arm of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America) immediately issued a strong statement disassociating themselves from this \"hurtful public pronouncement [which] flies in the face of Jewish peoplehood.\"\n\nFinally, before one can denounce a statement like this, one should make an attempt to understand the position of those making the statement. According to Orthodoxy, the Torah is the heart of Judaism. All of what our people are revolves around the unchanging, eternal, mutually binding covenant between G-d and our people. That is the definition of Jewish belief, according to Orthodoxy, and all Jewish belief is measured against that yardstick. You may dispute the validity of the yardstick, but you can't deny that Conservative and Reform Judaism don't measure up on that yardstick. Reform Judaism does not believe in the binding nature of Torah, and Conservative Judaism believes that the law can change.\n\nThe Agudath Ha-Rabonim did not intend to cut Reform and Conservative Jews off from their heritage. On the contrary, their intention was to bring Reform and Conservative Jews back to what they consider to be the only true Judaism. The statement encouraged Reform and Conservative Jews to leave their synagogues and \"join an Orthodox synagogue, where they will be warmly welcomed.\" I believe the Agudath Ha-Rabonim were sincere, albeit misguided, in this intention. I have known several Orthodox and Chasidic Jews who believed that if there were no Reform or Conservative synagogues, everyone would be Orthodox. However, my own personal experience with Reform and Conservative Jews indicates that if there were no such movements, most of these people would be lost to Judaism entirely, and that would be a great tragedy.\n\nThe opinion of mainstream Orthodoxy seems to be that it is better for a Jew to be Reform or Conservative than not to be Jewish at all. While we would certainly prefer that all of our people acknowledged the obligation to observe the unchanging law (just as Conservative Jews would prefer that all of our people acknowledged the right to change the law, and Reform Jews would prefer that all of our people acknowledged the right to pick and choose what to observe), we recognize that, as Rabbi Kook said, \"That which unites us is far greater than that which divides us.\"\n\nThere once was a site called Jewhoo, that had an extensive list of Jewish actors, athletes, and other celebrities. The site disappeared in 2005. I gather that the site owners got tired of doing a lot of work researching the Jewish background of celebrities only to find their efforts copied all over the Internet without even the slightest acknowledgement. The site exists no more, and the information is lost. Think about that the next time you copy someone else's work and insist that you're doing no harm. (Another one has disappeared since my last update, but it wasn't a great site and I have no idea why it disappeared).\n\nIn the absence of Jewhoo...\n\nJINFO has an outstanding collection of Jews who have won the Nobel prize in various areas or have excelled in various academic fields.\n\nJew or Not Jew seems to be trying to fill the gap left by the absence of Jewhoo. It lists Jews in a variety of categories and ranks their Jewishness on three factors: I (Israel, Jewishness by birth history and affiliation), O (Optics, how Jewish they look or act) and K (Kvell, how proud the creators of the site are to consider this person a Jew). It includes a lot of non-Jews who are perceived as Jewish and the text is a bit flighty, but they do seem to do the research and you can probably figure out from what they say whether you would consider the person Jewish.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n© Copyright 5756-5780 (1995-2020), Tracey R Rich\nIf you appreciate the many years of work I have put into this site, show your appreciation by _linking_ to this page, not copying it to your site.

    "passage": "Nii: Chapter 1 (My action sci-fi story title (SF) )\n\nThe time was 10:00 am and the place Nkran in the year 3000. On top of the biggest Bank building in the city, a dark, lean and tall man walked to the very edge and stopped, hands in his pockets. Below him, a thick crowd was formed and watched him in horror, fearing that he would commit suicide. However the man in question, Nii Okai, had no intention of jumping over the edge. He had simply come to enjoy the view of the entire city from that height.\n\n‘Some people believe that when one commits suicide, she or he is doomed to wander the earth as a restless spirit and denied access to the realm of the ancestors’ a soft voice suddenly said. He turned to his left and noticed a woman clad in the attire of the Asafo Bii, the traditional Ga militia. ‘Your life may be unpleasant but the afterlife is not so great either for those who die before their time’.\n\n‘I’m not going to jump’ said a shocked Nii. ‘I’m only here for the view.’\n\nShe looked at him in stunned silence and then looked at the entire city below them in the sunlight. ‘It’s a superb view’ she admitted ‘but there is a very frightened crowd down there who think you are going to jump and even more nervous Asafo Bii companies on the rooftops of the six buildings close to this one who think you’re going to do it’\n\nNii sighed and walked away from the edge with her. ‘My name is Larley, by the way’, she said extending her right hand to him. ‘Nii Okai’ he replied gripping it tightly in a firm handshake. Fifteen minutes later, he dogded a machete that arced toward his head and kicked the arm wielding it, knocking the akodze away.\n\nHe punched the assailant in the face, knocking him out. Five other men wielding machetes rushed at him and he unfastened his belt and lashed out at them, whipping them severely. His belt wrapped around one machete and yanked it away from his attacker and into the dirt.\n\nHe blocked the attacksfrom the four robbers and swung four times breaking each of their machetes. He leapt at one of them, his two feet kicking the chest of one of the attackers. He struck one on the left with his left foot and one on the right with his right foot. One dove at him, tackling him but he kicked upwards, sending him flying into the dirt behind him.\n\nThe third scrambled for the fallen machete but he reached it first, kicking him in the face with his knee. He heard a loud click of guns being cocked as the barrels of 4 AK-47 guns were pointed in his direction by four grim faced women. An afena spun towards them, slashing through 3 of the guns before striking the dirt.\n\nLarley lunged at the three of them, striking them with quick punches and kicks to the chests and kicks. The fourht shot at her but she strafed her to her left, making a perfect shot impossible. She spun towards the shooter and slashed through the akodze with her afena, her blade stopping inches from the neck of the shooter.\n\nSeveral Asafo Bii rushed towards the men and women, restraining them as Larley examined the guns with a puzzled look on her face. 'What is it, Larley?' Nii asked. \n\n'These are military grade weapons' Larley said to herself. 'Very sophisticated and only permitted to be used by the Ghanaian Military under the 3 weapon safety lawsof the Ga Traditional Council'.\n\nUnder the Akodze Safety Laws, knives, guns, akofenas, spears were issued with special permits to the Military. The use of such akodze by civilians was banned in the year 3000. This law was so vigourously enforced that the three criminal elements left in the city had to resort to the use of sticks and farm implements like machetes to conduct their operations.\n\n'I'll have to take them to the company headquarters for questioning' she said and paused for a moment. \n\n'It's 2:00 pm' Larley pointed out. 'Shouldn't you be at work on this Monday morning?'\n\n'100 people were retrenched at the company building I was standing on this morning. I needed time to contemplate my future' he replied.\n\n'After our talk, I was heading home when I noticed these people capprying several akodze into a truck. They spotted me and we had a slight confrontation'.\n\n'Then you're a witness', sighed Larley. 'I'll have to take you for questioning too.''\n\nThe Asafo Bii headquarters consisted of a series of buildings constructed in a traditional domed design and stood in the centre of the city. Behind a thick layer of glass, Larley and the Asafoatse (Chief Warrior) Naa watched as Nii gave his statement. 'The akodze you brought in today are similar to the ones the Asafo Bii picked up at the edge of Nkran this afternoon.' Naa mused.\n\n'Larley, someone is stockpiling weapons across the city, possibly in preparation for a planned ethnic conflict or violent chieftaincy dispute.'\n\n'I understand, Asafoatse Naa' Larley sighed. 'We will interrogate the culprits thouroughly to find out everything they know'. I've also posted an alert to the other Asafo Bii Companies that their main priority now is to check for the movement of akodze and suspicious persons in the city'.\n\nNaa nodded in agreement. 'Train Nii in Abotri ke Tahuumo (Ga Martial Art) as well as the rest of the ways of the Asafo Bii, if he's interested in becoming one. He's already shown that he can handle himself in a fight. If we wnat to avoid the loss of lives and property that come with these conflicts, we'll need all the help we can get'.\n\nLarley and Nii, armed with a baton faced each other in the training room of the Asafoakyer Bii (female asafo Bii Captains). 'There are several components of Abotri ke Tahuumo.' she noted.\n\n'Abotri is the Complex use of handstands and somersaults, Intia Shomo is the use of complex kicking and feet attacks, Mim Dzee is the art of evading attacks, Kwasafo Nomo and Asafo Atwele are the arts of free expression and multi partner combat strategy, Asafo ke Tahuumo kaklakle lor is the art of fighting in a trance like state, Ataalai Gbanoo is the art of cartwheeling, Adzenkeklulu is the art of acrobatics'.\n\nLarley drew out an afowatsena (double or triple bladed sword) from the scabbard slung across her shoulder and sunk into an offensive stance. 'My favourite art is Kakla ke klante Nomo, the art of bladed weapon combat'. Without warning, she lunged at Nii forcing him to spin away from the attack using Ataalai Gbanoo .\n\nEven as he strived to keep his distance to look for an opening, Larley struck at him again and again using Gbobi hava, the art of hunting down prey, forcing him to be on the defensive. He snatched an afonanta (machete like sword) from a wooden stand on his right and blocked her attacks matching Larley's kaklake Klante Nomo with his own version.\n\nHe noticed an opening and tried to swing the afonanta to tap her shoulder lightly, signalling the end of the bout. Surprisingly, she caught the blade between her teeth and drew her head back, yanking him off balance. Even as he stumbled, she dealt him several ferocious double hand slaps and kicks with her feet.\n\nAs he collapsed to the ground, she pinned him facedown by locking his feet and arms in a tight brace. The door to the training room slid open and a woma with a shaved head walked into the room and sat down on the training mat beside Larley. 'The interrogation's complete' she reported. \n\n'The attackers said they were supposed to send the akodze to the old underground train station beneath the Great Nkran Museum.'\n\n'That place is a maze, Akai' sighed Larley. 'I'll need a clear outline of the place to avoid any surprise attacks on the Asafo Bii.'\n\n'We could get the outline from the new library across the street' ventured Nii.\n\nAt the Abrewanana (sage) library, Nii paused outside the door for a moment, with Larleyand Akai at his side. 'Leave your akodze (weapons) and portable communication devices at the entrance. This library has soundproof walling and has strict rules about silence within its walls, even for Asafo Bii' he instructed.\n\nAfter 11 minutes of searching, they found the outline of the old underground station and headed back to the headquarters. Several Asafo Bii gathered around Larley as she mapped out the points for entry.\n\n'The station is in the middle of three entry points.' she noted. 'The old 'galamsey' mines, the abandoned goldmine shafts and the old route for the oil pipelines. We'll split into three groups to cover more ground tonight'\n\nA truck slowly moved through the shafts, armed to the teeth with several women wielding AK-47s, grenade launchers, akofenas, crossbows and longbows and other akodze. 'Stay sharp, Dedoi's follower in the Asafo Bii warned us that vehicles B and C were seized earlier today, warned a fair, heavily tattoed woman wielding two ekumapraban (long handled axes).\n\nFour arrows shot through the tires of the truck, deflating them. The arrows whizzed through the air, nearly slicing through the wooden handles of the ekumapraban but its wielder was faster, slashing the projectiles. She sunk into an offensive stance as Nii and Akai charged at her.\n\nShe fended off the swings of their akodze with her own, preventing the handles from being slashed. She swung at both of them but Nii spun around the left akodze and spun again to his right as she drew the akodze back the axe head nearly slashing his back. At that moment, he swung at the axehead with all his might, smashing it into pieces before breaking the wooden staff with his left sandaled foot.\n\nShe drew back and struck at Akai who blocked the attack with her afonanta at the same moment as Nii kicked the woman's head with his left foot. She fell against a truck tire and watched as several of her people were restrained and bound in handcuffs. She drew out 6 smoke bombs and smashed them against the floor before fleeing.\n\nNii gave chase even as she paused at tinervals to shoot at him with two Berettas. Despite warnings from Akai, he pursued her deeper into the tunnels. She looked over her shoulder as their path became darker and she could no longer see him. She stepped and remained motionless behind a wall to draw out two shocksticks, each baton designed to deliver a high amount of electric shock.\n\nA mobile phone in her backpocket began to ring and as she reached for it, a figure suddenly darted at her from her right, his afonanta glowing in the dark as it slashed through her shocksticks. She swung her left foot at him but he spun around it and dealt her ferocious double hand slaps and kicks to her torso, forcing her into a corner and stopping only when she slumped to the ground.\n\nThe phone rang twice and stopped as Nii turned her over and picked it up. He heard two footsteps in the darkness and brandished his afonanta as he sunk into an offensive stance. Akai and Larley stepped into the light from the phone and Nii lowered his akodze before turning his attention to the phone.\n\nUsing his experience in the I.T division of the bank that retrenched him, he was able to get pas the multiple security features of the phone and unlock it. One name stood out among the most recent calls, Dedoi.\n\n'You are certain it was Dedoi?' asked Naa with a hint of disbelief.\n\n'Yes' replied Nii. 'It seems she was behind the movement of akodze and fighters to key parts of the city. We checked the messages on the phone and they confirm this.'\n\n'Dedoi is a royal and the sister of Chief Naarkie' Naa said to herself, as she rose from her mat and watched the city below from her office. 'I will inform the Ga Traditional Council myself'.\n\nIn the centre of the royal quarters of Nkran, a long haired woman sighed as five armed men slowly edged towards her. Before they could strike, she drew out two Glock pistols and shot each one in the chest. Five more men lunged at her but she anticipated their movements and shot them without wasting a bullet using Gun Kata (The martial art of gunplay). \n\nShe noticed five figures darting towards her from behind but she spun towards them , clutching a large duffel bag that released a hail of bullets. The bag fell apart, revealing a large machine gun. The fallen attackers faded away, and a blue light shone from a yellow hologram disk on the floor.\n\nThe light materialised into the image of an old woman with a shock of white hair. 'Dedoi, the Ga Traditional Council wishes to invite you to attend a special session' she spoke.\n\n'I'll be there shortly, Chief Naarkie' Dedoi replied softly before the image flickered off. She felt uneasy about her sister's tone of voice and made three brief calls before setting off for the council building on foot. As soon as she entered the grand hall, she felt the eyes of the rest of the council looking at her with disapproval.\n\n'My apologies, Dedoi', Naarkie said sadly. 'I'm sure its a false allegation but you have to goto the Asafo Bii for questioning.'\n\n8 Asafo Bii approached her from behind and one made the mistake of holding her shoulder. Dedoi turned towards that Asafo Bii and punched her in the face. One Asafo Bii rushed towards her but she grabbed the Asafo Bii she had punched earlier and shoved her into the second one.\n\nThe Asafo Bii brandished their akodze and Dedoi pulled out her guns as the other council members edged away from her in fright. Naarkie shoved them aside and thrust herself between the Asafo Bii and Dedoi. Dedoi sighed and holstered her guns. 'I'll go quietly'\n\nAt 7pm, Koi a janitor at the Asafo Bii Headquarters begun his usual duties, cleaning the training rooms and offices of the Asafo Bii. At 7:30 pm, after cleaning the washrooms, he received three phonecalls and each message he relayed was the same: 'The Asafo Bii are moving Dedoi through the Efua Gardens tonight using the northern footpath.'\n\nAt 8:00 pm, the Asafo Bii marched through the gardens with their captive. Akai led the march when five porcupine quills tore through the leaves of the nearby trees and struck her in the arms and legs and chest. The remaining Asafo Bii brandished their weapons and formed a protective ring around Dedoi.\n\nOn their left, a large burst of flame erupted towards them, setting several Asafo Bii on fire. The circle broke as several Asafo Bii rolled in the dirt to put out the flames. Five Asafo Bii escorted Dedoi away from the flames that licked the bushes around them when a bullet struck each of them in the shoulder.\n\nAs they fell, three women stepped out of the bushes, one wielding porcupine quills, the other a large flamethrower and the third, heavily tattoed wielding two large pistols. \n\nThe third woman slashed the handcuffs with and akofena and together the four of them disappeared into the bushes.\n",

I was happily married to my husband Michael for fifteen years.  We met when I was twenty years old.  He was so odd when I first laid eyes on him at a college dance.  He was sitting watching everyone dance with amusement, but there was something so serene about him.  I had to get to know him.\n\nWe ended up dating for only a few weeks before we got married, some may have thought that was way too quick but when family and friends saw us together they knew we were meant to be.  Our relationship was a happy one filled with passionate love making and many nights cuddled together on the couch watching television. When I was 25 we welcomed our first child.  We named her Raine for the dreary day in which she was born.  I will never forget the labor pain I endured with her, Michael was there holding my hand and whispering encouragement into my ear.  My mother was on my other side telling me to push while my father was in the waiting room with an unlit cigar in his mouth and a look of fresh new grandparent joy spread across his thin lips.  He had been a great father and would be an even greater grandfather.\n\nWith such a loving home I am at a loss to explain what my daughter had become. The evil, the lies.  How could she have hidden this all from us?  My son Duncan was born on my 30th birthday.  It was an easy pregnancy and delivery.  He was born on a day of fresh spring air and sunlit beauty.  He was a child of pure innocence.  Although he was born two months early he was strong and adapted to the world quickly.\n\nRaine took to being a proper good sister and even at the tender age of five she did all she could to help with the care of her little brother and the upkeep of the house.  I used to laugh when she would try and sweep the floors for us.  It was adorable.  This little girl trying to use a broom three times her height.  She tried so hard, she was a constant joy.  Was it an act?  Was she like this from the beginning?  When did she fall? No. No child could be that deceptive from such a young age. Could they?\n\nWhen the detectives explained their case and the evidence they had uncovered I could not bring myself to look and when I finally did I was in denial that the images of my daughter with the butchered and disfigured bodies of multiple men.  The pictures looked so mundane at first glance.  Just a smiling child, but that was all.  Upon closer inspection you could see that what she was sitting beside was a gruesome and almost hellish scene.  It was as if someone had photoshopped my daughter into some suicide bombing scene in Iraq.  At first this is what I had believed had been done but the detectives assured me that was not the case.  There was my perpetually happy daughter sitting in a scene of absolute carnage as if she was on a trip to the park.  This picture alone was not enough to convince me of the evil monster I had given birth to.  This could not be her.  This could not be my Raine.\n\nThey took the time to explain to me what was happening.  I could hear them but they were like muffled voices a long way off, I just kept staring at the picture they had showed me.  I did not notice one of the detectives had taken out an Android Tablet and began setting it up on the table.  He smelled of spearmint gum and cigarettes.  He looked as if he never showered and shaved only about once a week.  My home felt invaded and even as I sit here in my socks typing this on an old typewriter sipping coffee I still have that feeling.  This is what a rape victim must feel like.  Exposed, scared, alone.  I am alone now in this house.  It seems so much bigger when it’s empty.\n\nThe pungent detective brought me back to the reality of my situation as he set the tablet before me with a video queued up. The picture was still, an image of Raine, she wore a face I had never seen before, and it was one of exquisite evil, the type of look that would haunt a person for the rest of their life.  The play button hovered over her face.  He eyes seemed so dark, empty, soulless.  The detective told me to press play whenever I was ready.  I wish I could have sat there permanently.  I never wanted to press that button.  The image of my daughter on the screen mocked me, I tried many times to reach for the screen but I pulled my hand back unable to bring myself to cross the threshold of ignorance into understanding.  Finally the detective felt he had waited long enough, his restlessness became apparent as you could begin to hear the tapping of impatient fingers on the wood grain of the kitchen table.  He reached for the tablet but before he could press the button my finger darted to the screen and pressed play.  It felt as if a force had used me to do that.  I felt outside myself.  As the setting sun began to sink below the hills and the magic hour light faded from my kitchen the video began to play.\n\nThe video began with Raine standing there looking into the camera, it was obvious someone else was there as well, holding the camera for her.  “Are you ready?” she asked the person behind the camera and to my astonishment the voice of a child not an adult answered back.  “Yes, I think so.”  It was the voice of another little girl, a little girl I was very familiar with.  She was Hannah, a playmate of my daughter.  The two were joined at the hip when it came to school but in everyday life they seldom played together.  I was not aware of Hannah having been here in at least two months, despite the video clearly showing a date of one week ago.\n\n“Move the camera around so our audience can see our lair.”  My daughter spoke eloquently, far advanced of her tender years, she sounded like another person, the stumbling bubbling speech of a child had been replaced by that of a cold and calculating monster.  The tempo of her voice was soft and even, there was no emotion in the tone.  It was as if something had possessed this child,  but this was reality and I could see the familiar glint of my daughter, this was her true self, the deception was who she presented to her family.\n\n“Why are we making a video Raine?”  Hannah asked meekly.  It was clear Hannah was the subordinate one.\n\n“I want a memento of this day, to watch when I get bored.”  She said with a chilling smile to the camera.  “My mom won’t be home until six so we have a few hours.”\n\nIt was clear this event was taking place in my basement.  But I frequently went down there and never found anything to be amiss.  After a moment the reasoning became all too clear.  Our house was an old one and there are some place in old houses that only children knew about.  She watched as the camera followed Raine to a spot under the stairs. In the corner was a small door which she disappeared through, a moment later the camera followed her in.  When the camera adjusted to the dimmer light a room became apparent on the video.  It was a room built underground off the house, it must have been used long ago to store food items to save them from the summer heat.  I had not been aware that this room existed but was not surprised, it was tucked away beneath the stairs.\n\nInside the room, was a bed, a dresser and a small table in the corner.  There was no covering on the wall and the beams looked like ribs painted a dusted white that gave the whole room an ethereal look.  Everything appeared just a bit too small for a normal person, the ceiling was low, an adult would have to stoop down to navigate the room.  This was a place designed for a child.  The camera panned around and I was able to see more of the room.  There was a mirror on the opposite wall by the door.  A dirty rug that had the obvious browned stains of blood was frayed on the corners with an image of a child playing in a garden embroidered on it. This room was like something from another world, something you would see in a nightmare or a horror movie, I could not believe this place had been beneath my feet for months, and who knows how much longer.  Raine had lived in this house her entire life but there had never been any indication of her disappearing down here or anything out of the ordinary for that matter.  I didn’t want to see anymore, I didn’t want to see what my daughter was going to do down here.  I wanted to run from the house but I couldn’t move I was transfixed on the screen, the whole world had disappeared leaving only me and this video, the images consumed me, drawing me in.\n\n“Ok set the camera up over there, he won’t be able to see it there and we’ll be able to capture everything.”\n\n“Did Allie do this for you last week?”  I could hear Hannah ask as the picture went crazy with the fiddling she was doing.  \n\n“Another girl was involved in this?”  I asked the detective.\n\n“It appears she had at least three other girls beside her were involved in this.  All have been taken into custody and will be questioned later when things calm down a bit.  The media is going haywire about this.”  He had said.\n\nThe jerking movement of the camera stopped and the whole of the room was now in full view of the camera.  “Where should I go?”\n“Just wait at the top of the stairs until I call you ok?”\n\nI could hear Hannah leave and a moment later I could hear the quiet shuffling of her feet on the stairs but the door did not open or close so it was obvious she was sitting at the top of the stairs just out of sight but within ear shot.\n\nWhen Hannah was gone Raine went to the camera and looked into the lens, her eyes were wide and crazed like a rabid animal.  These were not the eyes of a child anymore but those of a predator.  After inspecting the camera she smiled into it as if nodding to a future audience.  “Enjoy the show.” She said.  She then walked over to the bed and sat down.  She remained there motionless and silent for the next fifteen minutes until a knock on the door brought her out of her own head and back into the world.  She glanced at the camera before getting up and walking out of the room, a few minutes later she came back in but she was not alone.  There was a man accompanying her now, he was about 5’10 but that was hard to tell because he had to stoop over in this child’s secret room.  He was thin and at least between forty and fifty years of age with a short gray haircut.  He wore khaki pants and a blue and white plaid shirt.  She took him by the hand and escorted him to the bed.\n\n“I didn’t think you were real.”  He said as he sat down on the bed and she stood in front of him holding his hands in hers.  “I can’t believe this is real, I’m so glad I answered your message online. \n\n My daughter pushed him gently back on the bed until he was lying down crossways with his legs planted on the floor.   Even in the dim room you could tell the man was aroused and he was expecting a taste of forbidden fruit.  Raine stepped away from him and walked across the room as the man began to unbutton his shirt preparing to indulge in the festivities yet to come. As he was busying himself Raine was opening the dresser drawer.  From the angle of the camera I could see a strange looking knife she had taken from the top drawer of the dresser.  It looked to be a jagged blade with a bone handle, I had never seen anything like it.  She hid the knife behind her back as she turned back toward the man now lying on the bed shirt open and pants unbuckled.  Raine walked toward him moving seductively hiding the blade behind her back.  She walked up between the man’s legs that were still hung over the bed planted on the floor, the man reached for Raine still thinking this was his lucky day.  As he reached for her, he hand moved in a flash from behind her back, the fingers that had been reaching for the forbidden flesh of a child were instantly severed, before he had time for a reaction Raine had turned the blade and thrust it into the man’s chest right below the sternum.  A blood curdling cry filled the small room and Raine looking right into the old man’s eyes pulled the jagged knife, slicing from sternum to groin.  This silenced the man as he went into shock and the only noise escaping from his mouth now was a gurgling sound of him drowning in his own blood.\n\nI was shocked, horrified… sick.  I jumped from my chair and rushed to the sink.  The vomit was thick and smelled of coffee and bile.  When I was done I turned on the faucet to try and wash it down the sink.  I couldn’t watch anymore, the detectives seemed to understand this and put the tablet away.  They told me the rest of the video was my daughter bringing Hannah back in and having her help clean up,  she had convinced the neighborhood girls that what they were doing was a good thing by riding the world of men who would prey on children.  She had them thinking they were doing God’s work.  These girls thought their parents would be proud of them.  Hannah was clearly shaken by what she had seen and done I knew she would be traumatized for life, but they explained Raine had just been humming away as she began wringing a sponge and wiping away the blood.  They said they had never seen anything so disturbing especially from a child.\nI could no longer think, I had no idea the response expected from me or if I would have to defend myself against accusation of my complicity in my daughter's actions.  There is no possibility of people feeling sympathy for me because there is no one who could believe I knew nothing, I would not even believe it myself if I were not the one to experience this horror myself, my daughter had been so cunning and absolute in her deception that forever people would ask when exactly did I know that Raine had fallen into evil?\n\n\nEND part 2\n",

    "passage": "Paralysis\n\n\tOne afternoon, I was playing basketball with a few of my friends at the outdoor courts by our old Junior High. It was summer and it was hot, probably in the upper 90s. Not everyone’s ideal weather for some ball, but we loved to play and had nothing better to do.We are all moderately good at the game, some of us better than the others. I wouldn’t consider myself to be the best. Will, my best friend, is on the varsity team for his fourth year in a row, while I only played my first two years in high school for JV. Our other two friends, Jordan and Andres, weren’t necessarily as good as us two, but they knew the game and could play at a moderate level.  \n\tWe usually play two-on-two, but after we get bored of that we go to H-O-R-S-E or Baseketball, a hybrid of basketball and baseball that Jordan said he saw in a movie once. That day, after a few games of two-on-two, Cooper and Andres winning two games, while Jordan and I beat them once, we decided to play a game of H-O-R-S-E. Honestly, I hate the game and all the guys know it. For some reason, my shooting turns to complete crap and I can’t sink a single shot. Andres always tells me that I suck at shooting to begin with, but I know for a fact that I could beat him in a game of one-on-one any day. He knows it too.  \n\tAnyway, we started our game of H-O-R-S-E by figuring out the order, which was according to the order of who could make a 3-pointer first. Will made the first three, so he went first. His first attempt was a successful baseline jumper. I followed, since I was second in the order, and got lucky. Swish. No “H” for me. Andres went after me and he also made the shot. Last but not least, Jordan went for it. Airball. He missed completely and received his first letter. H.  \n\tAbout five rounds later, I found myself in last place. I had H-O-R-S, while Andres and Jordan both had H-O-R, and Will had merely an H. It was my turn. Will just made a simple free throw. Easy. I could make that shot in my sleep any day. But this was in a game of H-O-R-S-E. I took my time, bouncing the ball a couple of times, spinning it in my hands. Finally, I took a deep breath and released the shot. I felt good about it, the ball was headed for the center of the rim, and I knew I put the right amount of arc on it. Everything was smooth sailing right up until it hit the back of the rim. The ball bounced up, as we all stared directly at it, and then took another bounce on the front of the rim. The rim gave the ball a bad bounce and, after what felt like hours, it was obvious that I had missed. I was the first one knocked out. H-O-R-S-E. I let out a dramatic “NOOO!” letting everyone in a fifty mile radius of how upset I was. The other guys yelled obnoxiously also, as if I hadn’t known I missed my shot.  \n\tI was pissed that I had to just sit there bored-to-death and wait for the guys to finish their game, so I decided to steal Jordan’s basketball and shoot at the next court over. I started with a free throw shot, which I made. Of course.  \n\tI then began to work on my slam dunks. I’m 6’2, so I can touch the rim easy, but it’s always a struggle to actually dunk with the ball. I tried a couple of times without the ball, just like I said, too easy. So, finally, I gave it a shot with the ball in my hands. I went up for the dunk, and boing! The ball bounced right off the rim as I tried slamming it through. I tried again, but this time I gave myself a longer running start. One step. Dribble. Another. Dribble. Two steps, and then I jumped.  \n\tLiftoff.  \n\tI felt good about this one right from the start. I jumped higher. I had a good grip on the ball. Everything felt right. I knew it was going to go in this time. And right I was.  \n\tIt felt so cool to finally dunk the ball. I mean I had before, technically, but on a 9ft hoop. But this time, 10ft baby! The noise the ball made as I forced it down the basket’s throat, making that net swoosh, was like no other.  \n\t“YAAAA! You guys see that?!”  \n\t“See what?” Bill asked.  \n\t“My dunk!”  \n\t“No joke?” said Jordan.  \n\tAndres added, “Yeah right, man. We know you ain’t got no skill!”  \n\t“Whatever! I’ll do it again! Just watch this time.”  \n\tWith all eyes on me, I went through the same motions I  made previously. I took my steps and jumped. Everything felt about the same, except I wasn’t as focused. I was all jittery since I knew everyone was watching. Regardless, I did my best to follow through. I attempted to slam the ball into the hoop and grab onto the rim, but rather I slammed it directly against the rim, which made me lose my balance. Instead of being able to hold onto the rim and swing my body, my momentum caused my legs to fly forward as my upper body, including my head began to fly back. And then the world seemed to stop.  \n\tBlack.  \n\tI woke up and saw all the guys standing around me. They were shouting at each other. I think Will yelled at Jordan to call 9-1-1. I asked them what happened, but they just told me to stay calm. I couldn’t remember much of anything at first, but it all rushed backed to me when Andres said something about how much “damn blood” there was, and I realized I was laying on the ground. I tried to get up, but I couldn’t move. I couldn’t feel my legs at all and could barely feel my arms.  \n\t“Guys, I can’t feel anything!”  \n\t“Evan, it’s gonna be okay! Just stay on the ground. An ambulance is on it’s way,” Will said, trying to relax me.  \n\t“There’s so much damn blood, man!” Andres shouted.  \n\tWill yelled to him, “Shut up, Andres! Gimme your shirt. Here Evan, lift up your head. I’m gonna put his shirt underneath your head as a pillow and to stop the bleeding.”  \n\tI lifted my head for Will to put the shirt underneath. When I set it back down, I noticed the tingling sensation on the back of my head. I immediately forgot about it because of the burning I felt on my back. It was almost 100 degrees and I was laying on the blacktop, probably with numerous scrapes. The pain I felt made everything extremely uncomfortable but it also gave me some ease. I could feel my back. I knew this might mean my spine wasn’t completely messed up. Regardless, it still hurt. It hurt so bad I just wanted to fall asleep so I didn’t have to deal with it. I closed my eyes.  \n\tWill shouted at me to wake up. He told me to stay awake. Jordan then asked for my mom’s cell phone number and I recited it to him quite well. I still couldn’t feel my legs though.  \n\tI heard sirens growing closer.  \n\tJordan said my mom didn’t answer but he left her a voicemail telling her what happened. I started to worry. I felt like such an idiot. How could I have let this happen? I honestly thought there was a possibility of me dying that day.  \n\t“There’s so much damn blood!”  \n\tAn ambulance and a firetruck arrived shortly thereafter and a bunch of the paramedics and firefighters started to surround us. The asked me a ton of questions, like who the president was, what year it was, who am I, where I live, etc. Obama. 2013. Evan Benowitz. 255 Alderglenn Drive.  \n\tThey turned me over to look at the wound on the back of head. I started to get the feeling back in my legs around then. Then they asked more questions about where I felt pain and how bad it was. I told them it was just my head, neck, shoulders, and back. I didn’t say anything about the feeling in my legs. They then loaded me up with a neck brace onto a stretcher and into the back of the ambulance, which was the most uncomfortable ride of my entire life. One of the paramedics road back there with me, talking to me, trying to keep me calm. He gave me my phone to make any calls, but my mom still didn’t answer her phone. Before I put my phone in my pocket, I sent a text to Will saying “Thank you guys.”  \n\tThe ambulance arrived at the hospital fifteen minutes later and they rolled me into the emergency room. A nurse cleaned me up and then took me into many a couple different rooms to get X-rays and a CAT scan. After all the various tests, which were very uncomfortable, the nurse took me back into the ER section and left me to find the doctor.  \n\tI laid there, just looking up at the ceiling. I barely even noticed that I was in a room designed for kids. Dora and Boots were both painted on the walls probably to cheer up young patients. I wasn’t tired. I just thought to myself. I was upset and scared. An hour or so before that, I thought I might be paralyzed or even dead.  \n\t“Hey, buddy.” It was the paramedic who was in the back of the ambulance. “I hope you get better soon. No more pretending to be like Mike, okay?”  \n\t“Promise. Thank you for everything.”  \n\t“No problem. It’s my job.”  \n\tI could tell he truly cared, which made me feel somewhat better.\n\tRight after that, my mom walked into the room. At first she didn’t say anything, and neither did I. She kinda just looked at me with relieved yet sad look on her face. She had been through a lot. Ever since my dad died right before high school, she had been on her own.  \n\tI was the first one to speak: “I’m sorry, mom.”  \n\tWith those words, I couldn’t hold it in any longer. I started crying. She rushed to my side. Then she started crying.  \n\t“I know the bills are gonna cost so much money. Money we don’t have with dad gone. Mom, I’m so sorry.”  \n\t“Evan, forget the money. I’m just glad you’re okay. I never want to lose you.”\n\n\t“I love you, mom.”\n\n\t“I love you too, son.”",

    "passage": "A story about an old man who’s dog is killed by another dog and his attempt to buy another dog to kill the culprit. \n\nHi im a 16 year aspiring writer and these is one of my short stories, please try to as critical as you can.\n\n\nIt was a cold afternoon. The old retiree opened the back door of his one-storey dwelling carrying a light brown leather leash with a robust metal chain and the end of it. Therein almost immediately barking ensued. The barking was of his dog, ecstatic in the knowledge of what was to follow. The dog was confined to a small caged perimeter in the corner of the retiree’s backyard. It was a dog that was neither big nor small, but in either case it was one which could have been loyal, accessible and most of all obedient to the man, had it not been neglected. The dog had a name but the old man in his petulance had always called it, Dumb Dog. \n\nDumb Dog had gone overlooked after the demise of the old man’s wife. Who in her last stand of her doomed battle with cancer, had given it to her spouse, as a parting gift. One that was to bring him companionship in the time he had left on this earth without her. The old man however saw the creature as nothing but smut and frankly only kept it around for the sake of not upsetting his children for when they payed a visit, which increasingly became scarcer by the months. \n\nThe old man would soon grow tired of the dog’s barking and would use the leash in his hand to lash the dog into silence. The dog, which was evidently malnourished, yelped woefully and cowered to the ground, as the old man shouted, uncalled for obscenities at it. \n\nIt is often said that canines are the only animals that have truly seen their Gods. But if Dumb Dog didn't know it, he was sure to have an idea, that his God was a callous one. A man who lived his life with consuming rage and anger, belittling sentiments and utter despise for anything that was a threat to his pride. The old man was nothing but a ruthless brute that ruled the house once with alcohol pumping through his veins and his fists pounding through his loved ones and yet old age had now mellowed him. But if Dumb Dog had a say in all of this, he would agree that old dogs never learn new tricks and the old man would still yet remain somewhat of a hard knock.\n\nWalking along the pavement, Dumb Dog, in his excitement and foolishness would stretch the old man every so often. Having the old man to either pull back the leash causing Dumb Dog to choke on his own collar or to simply beat some darn sense into him. Nevertheless when they reached the park, the old man would free Dumb Dog from his shackles to roam the green with liberty, it was a sentiment of absolute annoyance on behalf of the old man. \n\nWith Dumb Dog sniffing, urinating and exorcising the true nature of his kind, the old man realised that another dog, a much bigger one had entered the fray, unattended and with no God to govern him. The big dog was of a German Shepard kind, if not a cross breed and it had all the characteristics of being a wild and evil dog. \n\nThe bad dog trotted along the concrete pavement that ran through the park tending to its own business. The old man unconsciously thought about the safety of himself and even his redundant canine companion. He rose to his feet instinctively and began to hurry towards Dumb Dog, it was the least he could do. Yet at the same exact moment, Dumb Dog himself had spotted the Bad Dog and because of its purity and stupidity, it ran directly towards it. The old man shouted at Dumb Dog to stop, but Dumb Dog wasn't trained for that sort of authority nor was he ready for what was to follow.\n\nBy the time the old man had reached the dogs, the German Shepard was declared the champion, except Dumb Dog was never a contender. Dumb Dog’s gullet was being yanked wildly in this moment in time. It was brutal to watch but even more so brutal to be at the receiving end of it. Poor Dumb Dog thought the old man, who tried in vain to remove the Bad Dog off of Dumb Dog, by kicking and stomping on it, which seemed to work for a while, or he had at least hoped it had worked. Only for it to turn out to be an unwise idea, for as the German Shepard turned its fury towards the old man and even bit him on the hand. The old man moved away swiftly in fear and continued to watch in horror as Bad Dog went back to finish the job at hand. The old man, helpless as he watched the life seize in dumb dog did not try again; he simply consoled himself, with the idea that every dog had its day. Foolishness had been the reason behind that day for Dumb Dog.\n\nThe old man would later forget what happened exactly after the attack mostly to the shock he had encountered. But it did occur to him that he had made a statement to the police regarding the incident. He had gone to the hospital to have his hand examined, which explained the bandage that wrapped his right hand and then him talking to his youngest daughter over the telephone just before he went to sleep, where she had told him amongst other things “don't worry, we’ll get you another one”. Get me another one? He thought. What for? He imagined? To entertain him? To keep him company? Or to feel less bad about not being visited by his children? Of course it was the latter, but he couldn't be sure.\n\nThe next day was nothing out of the ordinary; nothing had changed for the old man, after all the dog was nothing but a burden, which had never excited an emotion in him. Although it must be said that whilst reading the day’s newspaper he did hear the bark of a dog and it had made him think of Dumb Dog almost instantly. He didn't particularly miss him but, it was his dog nonetheless, it belonged to him, it was his possession and it was taken from him just like his wife had been many months ago.\n\nMany days would pass since the attack, when the old man made a phone call to the police officer that had taken his statement. The old man had called to enquire about the case of the Bad Dog. He was truly banking on the fact that it had been found and destroyed by now; after all it was what he had been promised. For it had no purpose left, besides to kill and kill again. Yet the police did not find the dog nor did they even look as far as the old man was concerned. He tried to bite his tongue in, once he heard the outcome, but he couldn't help it when he shouted, that the police force were just a bunch of “inconsiderate, uninterested and imprudent lot of pricks”. \n\nMonths had past, when whilst walking through the same park that had been the setting of Dumb Dog’s death, the old man spotted a German Shepard, which had unmistakably resembled Bad Dog. This time with its owner or God. The old man didn't think twice about it and he approached the owner. Not in interest or curiosity as one would expect, but with accusations and allegations. Bewildered, the owner denied every single bit of it. He was adamant that his dog was trained and not in any way a danger to people or other dogs for that matter. The accusations would then turn into abuse and almost into a physical confrontation between the two bickering parties. The police would eventually arrive whom concerned witnesses had called. They tried telling the old man to move on and that he had accused the wrong dog. But the old man’s antics would spill over to them. They weren’t only disinterested; they were also lying through their teeth, he held. \n\nIt was clear that the old man was a fellow with too much pride. The empty bottle of Jack in the living room that same night did not signify sorrow and yearn for Dumb Dog, instead it was to numb the battering his pride had taken. It was also that same night that a show was on the television box. A documentary on dogs, dangerous dogs. Among the many mongrels was the American Pit Bull. It was a dog that was not big in size but big in bite. The more the old man listened, the more he thought about revenge against Bad Dog. He would have his day, he supposed as soon as Good Dog got a hold of him.\n\nThe next day, the old man had withdrawn his entire pension payment and had combined it with what little savings he had. He was to buy a Pit Bull, a killer to kill a dog, which had killed another dog, it was confusing, but it had to be done and it needed to be done straight away, thus puppies were out of the question. He searched for a full-grown pure breed, but none wanted to sell, until he met Dave a man who was willing to part with his for cash to fix his heroin habit. Dave was a crook no less, but he had the decency to tell the old man, that it was an unwise decision, he was not his dogs God and he couldn't command him like Dave could. But the old man knew that once he had seen Butch he had seen his accomplice, he would tame him and they would be buddies he believed. \n\nButch or Good Dog as he became to be known, tried to kill the old man for the next month or so. But steady food and shelter made him a sympathizer. Another month would pass and another after that. Up until the point where old man would grow fond of Good Dog; he had made him smile and laugh. For a moment the old man even thought about abandoning his plans for revenge, in the fear that something bad would come of it for Good Dog. That was to be the case until one day, when the victim would come face to face with his old nemesis. Bad Dog was there at the park once again with his owner, but so was Good Dog. He knew what Good Dog was capable of, after all he had witnessed him shred countless tires in the backyard. So he knew the outcome, but what if he got injured? He asked himself. \n\nBut pride was fucking the old man; it was bigger and stronger then one hundred Good Dog’s. He wandered over to Bad Dog and the owner, who appeared to be teasing the dog into jumping for a plastic toy. Once real close, he unleashed Good Dog.\n\n\nThanks",

    "passage": "Identification (psychology)\n\nIDENTIFICATION is a psychological process whereby the individual assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of the other and is transformed wholly or partially by the model that other provides. It is by means of a series of identifications that the personality is constituted and specified. The roots of the concept can be found in Freud's writings. The three most prominent concepts of identification as described by Freud are: primary identification, narcissistic (secondary) identification and partial (secondary) identification.[1]\n\nWhile “in the psychoanalytic literature there is agreement that the core meaning of identification is simple – to be like or to become like another”, it has also been adjudged '“the most perplexing clinical/theoretical area” in psychoanalysis'.[2]\n\n\nFreud\n\nFreud first raised the matter of identification () in 1897, in connection with the illness or death of one's parents, and the response “to punish oneself in a hysterical fashion...with the same states [of illness] that they have had. The identification which occurs here is, as we can see, nothing other than a mode of thinking”.[3] The question was taken up again psychoanalytically “in Ferenczi's article, 'Introjection and Transference', dating from 1909”,[4] but it was in the decade between “On Narcissism” (1914) and “The Ego and the Id” (1923) that Freud made his most detailed and intensive study of the concept.\n\nFreud distinguished three main kinds of identification. “First, identification is the original form of emotional tie with an object; secondly, in a regressive way it becomes a substitute for a libidinal object-tie...and thirdly, it may arise with any new perception of a common quality which is shared with some other person”.[5]\n\nPrimary identification\n\nPrimary identification is the original and primitive form of emotional attachment to something or someone prior to any relations with other persons or objects:[6] “an individual's first and most important identification, his identification with the father in his own personal prehistory...with the parents”.[7] This means that when a baby is born he is not capable of making a distinction between himself and important others. The baby has an emotional attachment with his parents and experiences his parents as a part of himself. “The breast is part of me, I am the breast”.\n\nDuring this process of identification children adopt unconsciously the characteristics of their parents and begin to associate themselves with and copy the behavior of their parents. Freud remarked that identification should be distinguished from imitation, which is a voluntary and conscious act. Because of this process of emotional attachment a child will develop a (super)ego that has similarities to the moral values and guidelines by which the parents live their lives. By this process children become a great deal like their parents and this facilitates learning to live in the world and culture to which they are born.[8]\n\n“By and large, psychoanalysts grant the importance and centrality of primary identification, even though...the concept varies 'according to each author and his ideas, its meaning in consequence being far from precise' (Etchegoyen 1985)”.[9]\n\nNarcissistic (secondary) identification\n\nNarcissistic identification is the form of identification following abandonment or loss of an object. This experience of loss starts at a very young age.[10] An example: wearing the clothes or jewellery of a deceased loved one.[11] In “Mourning and Melancholia” Freud, having “shown that identification is a preliminary stage of object-choice”, argued that the experience of loss sets in motion a regressive process that “served to establish an _identification_ of the ego with the abandoned object”.[12] In “The Ego and the Id”, he went on to maintain that “this kind of substitution has a great share in determining the form taken by the ego and that it makes an essential contribution towards building up what is called its 'character'”.[13]\n\nLacan, in his theory of the Imaginary, would develop the latter point into his view of “the ego is constituted in its nucleus by a series of alienating identifications”[14] - part of his opposition to any concept of an “autonomous” and conflict-free ego.\n\nPartial (secondary) identification\n\nPartial identification is based on the perception of a special quality of another person.[15] This quality or ideal is often represented in a “leader figure” who is identified with. For example: the young boy identifies with the strong muscles of an older neighbour boy. Next to identification with the leader, people identify with others because they feel they have something in common. For example: a group of people who like the same music. This mechanism plays an important role in the formation of groups. It contributes to the development of character and the ego is formed by identification with a group (group norms). Partial identification promotes the social life of persons who will be able to identify with one another through this common bond to one another, instead of considering someone as a rival.[16]\n\nPartial identification and empathy\n\nFreud went on to indicate the way “a path leads from identification by way of imitation to empathy, that is, to the comprehension of the mechanism by which we are enabled to take up any attitude at all towards another mental life”.[17] Otto Fenichel would go on to emphasize how “trial identifications for the purposes of empathy play a basic part in normal object relationships. They can be studied especially in analyzing the psychoanalyst's ways of working”.[18] Object relations theory would subsequently highlight the use of “_trial identification with the patient in the session_”[19] as part of the growing technique of analysing from the countertransference.\n\n\nAnna Freud and identification with the aggressor\n\nIn her classic book _The Ego and the Mechanism of Defence_, Anna Freud introduced “two original defence mechanisms...both of which have become classics of ego psychology”,[20] the one being altruistic surrender, the other identification with the aggressor. Anna Freud pointed out that identification with parental values was a normal part of the development of the superego; but that “if the child introjects both rebuke and punishment and then regularly projects this same punishment on another, 'then he is arrested at an intermediate stage in the development of the superego'”.[21]\n\nThe concept was also taken up in object relations theory, which particularly explored “how a patient sometimes places the analyst in the role of victim whilst the patient acts out an identification with the aggressor”[22] in the analytic situation.\n\n\nWith the analyst\n\nMainstream analytic thought broadly agrees that interpretation took effect “by utilizing positive transference and transitory identifications with the analyst”.[23] More controversial, however, was the concept of “the terminal identification” at the close of analysis, where “that with which the patient identifies is their strong ego...[or] identification with the analyst's superego”.[24]\n\nLacan took strong exception to “any analysis that one teaches as having to be terminated by identification with the analyst...There is a beyond to this identification...this crossing of the plane of identification”.[25] Most Lacanians have subsequently echoed his distrust of “the view of psychoanalysis that relies on identification with the analyst as a central curative factor”.[26] How far the same criticism applies, however, to those who see as a positive therapeutic result “the development of a self-analytic attitude...[built on] identification with and internalization of the analyst's analytic attitude”[27] is not perhaps quite clear.\n\nMarion Milner has argued that “terminal identification” can be most acute in those analysands who go on to become therapists themselves: “by the mere fact of becoming analysts we have succeeded in bypassing an experience which our patients have to go through. We have chosen to identify with our analyst's profession and to act out that identification”.[28]\n\n\nIn psychoanalytic thinking today\n\nMuch has been written on identification since Freud. Identification has been seen both as a normal developmental mechanism and as a mechanism of defence.[29] Many types of identification have been described by other psychoanalysts, including counter-identification (Fliess,1953),[30] pseudoidentification (Eidelberg, 1938),[31] concordant and complementary identifications (Racker, 1957),[32] and adhesive identification (Bick, 1968):[33] “the work of Bick and others on adhesive identification, exploring the concept of the 'psychic skin'”.[34]\n\n[1] Laplanche, J. and Pontalis, J.-B.

    "passage": "Reuvein Margolies\n\nREUVEIN MARGOLIES, (Hebrew: ראובן מרגליות) (November 30, 1889 – August 28, 1971) was an Israeli author, Talmudic scholar and head of the Rambam library.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nMargolies was born in 1889 in Lemberg (now Lviv), then part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and now in Ukraine and from 1918 to 1940 in Poland. After the passing of his wife, he emigrated to Israel in 1934, settling in Tel-Aviv.\n\n\nWritings\n\nMargolies authored over 55 books on Jewish topics. He possessed a photographic memory, and was well versed in all aspects of both the written Bible, Oral Torah (Talmud and its commentaries) and Kabbalah (Zohar etc.).

    "passage": "Untitled works (Repost)\n\nUpon arriving at the school I was groggy. Not much sleep last night. I was at an elementary school serving as security. Today there was going to be a demonstration for the kids on military might and air superiority, as a way to get young kids excited for the military. They're trying to grab 'em while they're young I guess, influence 'em now and over the years that's what they'll want to do or so they hope.\nThe school was located next to a mountain that the military had barred off to the public. Convenient enough there was a base not far from the school. The mountain was off limits to civilians since an accident occurred there involving military personal and the story was that some chemicals leaked out, so no one was allowed to enter it. Today however was going to be an exciting demonstration of what one of the airforce’s top-of-the-line jets could do. They were going to blow up a bus. Jets weren't actually going to do anything as explosives had already been planted and were set to go off as the jets approached for a realistic effect.\nI was standing with my back next to a pillar just outside the school fences with some kids next to me eagerly awaiting the big event. The military had brought in some tanks but we were told they wouldn't be firing, they were just for show and so most of the kids weren't as exited for them.\nI figured there would be a speaker giving some talk on how great these new jets were. That was the whole point right? As we waited our attention was gathered to some General Pierce, who just told us two jets would fly by once to let us know they were preparing to “fire” and then on their second approach would fire at the bus, afterwards they would come around and land for the kids to ask them questions. This is where I came in. I'm here to make sure the kids don't rush mob the guy, don't know why they would but that's what I'm being paid for.\nAfter Pierce said his few words he left with what seemed like more protection than anything else. Don't know what that was about except that his ego is probably through the roof.\nThe jets made their first pass and the kids cheered and then got quite and awaited their next one. Then on their second pass, before they flew over the bus it exploded and all the kids cheered once again. Military personnel went to the bus and began to extinguish the fire and gather debris from the explosion.\nThe jets begin to land and the first one landed outside of the school fences next to me. I didn't like the idea of the pilot landing and standing near me, all I could think was that he would end up making some crack comment how I'm what happens when you don't join the military.\nAfter landing the pilot came out and greeted the kids. He told them to gather behind me and sit on the ground so that he could see all of them, and to raise their hands when they had a question. Everyone rose their hand as soon as they sat. As he began listening to their questions and answering them I went to spit out some gum I was chewing on and accidentally got it on the pilot's uniform. “My bad man” I said, but he just looked at me as if he didn't know why I was apologizing. The kids were kind enough to point out what I had done and he just gave me a look of disapproval. I'm sure in his head he was calling me an asshole.\nHe started talking again telling the kids how great it was flying a jet, how cool it was and some such nonsense. I was aggravated by the whole thing. I guess it was my fault for being security at some school. He kept talking about the perks of being in the military and not just the airforce. It was then that people starting shouting. I looked around and saw it was the cleanup crew near the bus. The were running from the mountain and just then I heard gunshots. Someone was shooting and I had no inclination as to who or where it was coming from. I immediately told the kids to return to the classrooms.\nAs quickly as the shootings began, the tanks rolled up and began firing on the mountain. What the hell was going on? I looked and saw that there were men emerging from the somewhere in the mountain. They were wearing black uniforms and looked like part of the military but why would they be shooting each other? I had no idea.\nThe pilot went to his jet and tried to lift off but their was something wrong with it. He got out and I heard him communicating with someone, his superiors I guess. They had remotely disabled the jets as there was an immediate no fly order given over the area. The pilot was upset and he displayed it.\nHe pulled out a rifle from a compartment on the jet began to head toward the mountain. I asked him what he was doing and he just looked at me and kept going. I don't know why but I followed him. He told me one the way to wherever we were headed that I needed to go back. I told him I wasn't going anywhere, I wanted to find out what was going on.\nAs we got closer I noticed there were shipping containers scattered about near what appeared to be the entrance to the mountain. They were covered with rock and camouflaged netting colored just like the mountain. Inside it looked like there was some installation. I had no idea what it was. People began to open fire on us as and we took cover behind one of the containers.\nHe handed me a pistol along with a few clips and asked me if I knew how to use it. I had previous training and told him so.\nAs the men got closer we shot them one after another but I knew we both would run out of ammo soon. We got lucky as two of them had somehow snuck past us and made their way behind the containers we had been using for cover. I only noticed them because I had just reloaded and after shooting them my heart was pounding. This was scary. I picked up their guns and they looked almost exactly like the rifle that the pilot had but there was something different about them but I couldn't put my finger on it.\nThe pilot told me he was planning on heading inside. I didn't know why and he told me to stay here. I told him he was crazy but that if he was going to go in I was heading in there with him, that I couldn't let him go in alone. I must be crazy too.\nHe had his orders just like the men in the tanks had theirs. They were still firing on the mountain and it could only mean that they were ordered to fire until given the order to recede. I had my orders too.\nWe noticed that men stopped exiting the facility as we got closer and I told him it could be some kind of ambush. He agreed and we proceeded with caution.\nEntering the facility we found men ripped apart. Their bodies were scattered about and neither of us had any idea what was did this, only that they were slaughtered. There was gunfire coming from down one of the halls. Just a few shots from a pistol I imagine. It stopped just as quickly as it started. We crept over to the one of the consoles located in the center of the room and the pilot started reading the displays. I wasn't sure what he was looking for and he didn't say when I asked him. Shortly after some of the same men we were firing upon began to rush into the area from one of the halls. They were retreating from something. Five of them kept firing down the hall and only hid behind the corners when they needed to reload. Some switch was activated and a doorway leading into the hall was closing, but slowly. Two of them were struck with something and fell to the ground. As one of them began to reload he saw us and yelled out to “get the hell out” while we still can. The other three didn't last long and each of them were each struck as the door finally closed. Only the one that yelled out to us seemed to be alive. I rushed over to him to find out what the hell was going on.\nThere was something on the other side of the door, I could hear screeching and something clawing at the door. It sounded pissed. I asked the guy what the fuck was going on. He told me “there isn't much time. You need to leave...You need to get out...get out before...before...”. That was it, that was the last thing he said before he died.\nWhen I looked back to the pilot he was still on the console. I took a moment to just look around the room. There was shipping containers in here as well, some surrounding the console. After looking more closely at the containers there appeared to be burn marks as well as giant scratch marks on the edges of each. What the fuck. I didn't know and I continued to look around. There were a total of fourteen halls, and as it stood twelve of them were closed. The two that were open were on the opposite side of the room that the men just came from. Side by side and both of them went in opposite directions after a few yards.\nThis pilot was still concerned about his mission and I didn't even know his name. I asked him and he just said it didn't matter, the only thing that did now was sealing the facility. I asked him why and he didn't say. He managed to get the right door to close. Damn did it close slow. I kept looking at both the last two doors expecting some horrific monster to appear but nothing did. The pilot had a grim look on his face and told me I needed to head back to his jet and bring back something just in case. I asked him about the other pilot and he assured me he was already dead.\nMy head was turned only for a few moments but it was enough time for something to shoot out before the door completely sealed and hit the pilot. He fell to the ground and within seconds some sort of poison began working through his body. He wasn't in any pain other than the area he was it that I could tell. I tried to have him hang on to me as I carried him but I knew it wouldn't work. I laid him against the side of one of the containers and brought him his rifle. I asked him what I needed from the jet and through slurred words he told me there was a belt in a compartment inside the jet. He mumbled something like “I can't believe it” and I told him I would be right back.\nI exited the installation and entered chaos. There were flying creatures all around. They were massive, some looked like the size of SUV's. More of the military had shown up and were firing at both the aerial creatures and the ones attacking them from the ground. I could see them out in the distance and had no idea what they were. They were in different shapes and sizes, the biggest the size of two men it seemed. I had no idea what they were and didn't care to find out. My path to the jet looked clear and so I made my way there. I thought about the kids and how they were doing. I could only imagine.\nI managed to make it to the jet without any trouble and I found the belt. It wasn't sure what I thought it would be but what it was was some sort of device. On the belt there were seven shells, a bit taller than a regular soda can and each one in bold red leaders read “Primed”. I didn't know what they would do but I had a good idea. I looked around and up at the sky. I figured I wouldn't another chance to see it.\nI headed back to where I left the pilot and found a man tending his wounds. He told me he had been poisoned, something I already knew, and that he would be unable to stand on his for awhile. I asked him if he could help carry him out and we began to lift him. Just then something struck the man and he fell, yelling in agony. I turned and saw this creature that had what appeared to have giant curved blades for arms hissing at us. I hesitated for a moment but I shot and killed it. The man was bleeding out and didn't say anything. He just looked at me if wanting to say sorry.\nI tried not to think about what I had just seen and asked the pilot if he could manage to make it out with me. He nodded and as I lifted him up he told me I would need to set the timer on one of the shells. As we stood we heard noises coming from the last hallway and turned to see creatures emerging it. We were quickly surrounded with them gnarling and growling at us.\nI set the pilot down and he told me to take one of the shells off and throw it on the ground. I assumed we would be dead after so I asked the pilot his name. “Landers, Christoff Landers”. I told him mine. Lance Taylor. As the creatures approached us I lifted one of the shells off the belt and rose it high, the rushed as I threw it down.",

    "passage": "Clontarf parish (Church of Ireland)\n\n[The parish church of St John the Baptist, Seafield Road, Clontarf] THE PARISH OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST, the Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf, Dublin is a religious community located on the north shore of Dublin Bay, bounded by the Parishes of North Strand to the west, Coolock to the north, and Raheny to the east (the latter two are in a Union).[1]\n\nThe Parish Church is situated on Seafield Road, approximately from the churches of each of the adjoining parishes. It was built in 1866 to replace an earlier church some 200 metres away on Castle Avenue, on the edge of the grounds of Clontarf Castle.\n\n\nThe early days\n\nThe first church in Clontarf was reputedly founded by the great Abbot of Bangor, St. Comgall, as part of Christian development through north Dublin, perhaps from a base at St. Mobhi's Church at Glasnevin. St. Comgall became the Patron of Clontarf and remained so until replaced by St. John the Baptist when the Parish came under the control of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem in the 14th century.\n\nClontarf was a central location of the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when Brian Boroimhe (Boru) defeated the Vikings and reduced their power in Ireland, although they retained control of Dublin city and much of the surrounding land. The remains of the well supposed to have been used by Brian Boru can still be seen on Castle Avenue, just under 500 meters from the Parish Church. The history of Clontarf itself, however, goes back much further.[2]\n\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nIn the reign of Henry II, the lands of Clontarf passed to the Knights Templar, an arm of the Church, and in turn, on the suppression of the Knights Templar in 1307, it became a preceptory of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, which it remained until their disbandment in 1542, when the last Prior, Sir John Rawson, was created Viscount Clontarf.\n\nAn early church had existed on the Castle Avenue site and this was rebuilt in 1609, the new building remaining the Parish Church for over 250 years, serving Clontarf and later also the neighbouring Parish of St. Brigid, Killester, which was amalgamated with Clontarf in 1686. In 1659, the population of Clontarf was 79 and of Killester 32.\n\n\nThe nineteenth century\n\nA key arrival in the Parish was Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, the grandson of Arthur Guinness, and his partner in running the brewery, who purchased lands in Clontarf and Raheny to form St. Anne's Estate (the remnants of which now comprise Saint Anne's Park). He was married to his cousin Elizabeth and all their children were baptised in Clontarf Parish Church.[3]\n\nIn 1872 Arthur (by then Sir Arthur) was elected to the Select Vestry of the Parish but, in a letter from Ashford Castle, declined the offer on the grounds of frequent absences from the parish. He funded the building of All Saints Church, Raheny. Benjamin's cousin Dr. Arthur Grattan Guinness practised and lived in the parish and most of his children were baptised in the church. In 1872 he was appointed Officer of Health for the parish jointly with James Colville.\n\n[Bram Stoker] On 30 December 1847 Abraham, son of Abraham and Charlotte Matilda Stoker of The Crescent, Clontarf, was baptised by Rev. Edward, a visiting clergyman from the Diocese of Ossory. Bram Stoker, as he became known, was the creator of the Dracula stories and is commemorated today in the Bram Stoker Museum in Westwood Club near the Crescent. Bram's family later moved to Artane Lodge but his younger siblings were also baptised in Clontarf.\n\nThe church, meanwhile, was becoming too small for its growing congregations, especially in the summer. Plans were developed in 1859 by Trustees including Mr. John E.V. Vernon of Clontarf Castle and substantial funding secured to build a second church at the Dollymount end of the parish. These plans were brought to an advanced stage, with an architect appointed and a site leased, despite the reservations of the Rector, Rev. William Kempston, who believed that the existing church was adequate and advised the Archbishop of his views. The Archbishop, whose permission was required for the building, told the Trustees that permission would not be given against the wishes of the Rector and the project was abandoned.\n\nIn 1862, Mr. Kempston left the Parish and was replaced by Rev. James Pratt. New plans were then developed with his co-operation for a new and larger church on a site close to the existing church. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. Vernon with great ceremony on 9 August 1864 and the church was completed over the next two years. The new church was consecrated by the Archbishop of Dublin at a service on 14 May 1866 and remains in use to this day. The church was originally built without a chancel and this was added in 1899.\n\n\nThe twentieth century\n\nThe First World War saw many of the parishioners joining up to fight[4] and these were commemorated by an illuminated scroll in the church and a War Memorial erected in the grounds.\n\nIn 1916, the fiftieth Anniversary of the building of the Church was celebrated at a special service on 14 May at which the Archbishop, Dr. Bernard, preached.\n\nThe 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s saw a building boom in the area and Clontarf grew to be one of the biggest parishes in the Church of Ireland. Greenlanes School, which had started in 1854 and had been located for most of its life in the Parish Hall on Seafield Road, about 200 metres from the Church, grew so much that a new school had to be built on a new site at Seafield Avenue and this was opened in 1952. The pace of growth was so rapid that by the time the new school was opened, it was too small and a further classroom was added and opened the following year.\n\nThe centenary of the Church was celebrated in 1966 with a programme of religious and social activities aimed at all age groups.\n\n\nThe twenty-first century\n\n[New Parish Centre under construction] The beginning of the new millennium was marked by the decision of the Select Vestry to dispose of the Parish Hall which had served the parish for well over a hundred years but had become a major maintenance burden. A new Parish Centre was completed in 2007, in the grounds of the church.\n\n\nCurates, rectors, and incumbents\n\nImpropriate Curates\n\n(Definition - Perpetual (or Impropriate) Curate : Clergyman in charge of a benefice in which all the tithes were held by someone else who could be a layman or another clergyman, for example the Archdeacon of Dublin.

    "passage": "On Thursday, June 30, New York's FOX 5 news proved there is great public interest in learning more about the complexities of Lyme disease.\n\nDespite airing at 10:30 p.m., the \"Lyme and Reason\" special drew strong ratings as it delved into issues surrounding Lyme disease that few news programs ever do, including the fallibility of diagnostic blood tests, common misdiagnoses, potentially fatal heart complications--including aninterview with Neil Spector, a medical doctor who was told by other physicians that his failing health was little to worry about--and then required an emergency heart transplant to save his life.\n\nNew York is one of the \"ground zero\" areas in which Lyme disease is endemic, with New York City only a little over 100 miles from Lyme, Connecticut--the town where Lyme was first discovered and described. Yet, as Susan Green, legislative council for NatCapLyme, told FOX5NY, \"this disease is in every state in the country...it is not selectively a northeastern disease.\" NatCapLyme is the primary community resource for Lyme disease patients in one of the country's most hard-hit areas, the Washington, D.C. region.\n\nLyme, in fact, is an epidemic, with the the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting over 300,000 new cases contracted by American people every year. This statistic was revised from an estimated 30,000 in 2013--yet the FOX5NY special is the first of its kind. Why?\n\nBecause, as discussed in the special, there is great resistance from medical authorities--particularly the CDC and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)--to acknowledge abundant current scientific evidence and countless patient reports of Lyme symptoms that persist and worsen following their recommended maximum 28 day treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe CDC has been notoriously quiet about Lyme disease, focusing almost exclusively on prevention (avoiding ticks, recognizing the bullseye rash that many Lyme patients never see) and avoiding conversation about poor diagnostics, newer research than that on which the IDSA treatment guidelines are based, and complexities relating to persisting Lyme symptoms. Emily Lampa, lead investigative reporter for a Salisbury, Maryland ABC news program, revealed that she was refused an interview by anyone at the CDC in May, for a story she produced as part of Lyme Disease Awareness Month.\n\nFOX5NY had better luck in securing a CDC interview. Paul Mead, chief of epidemiology and surveillance activity of the Bacterial Diseases Branch of CDC, confirmed in an on-camera interview that the Center continues to endorse the two-tiered ELISA and Western blot blood diagnostics that, as Susan Green described, have been proven to result in false negative readings for at least half of patients who are tested. Mead, on behalf of CDC, maintains that the two-tiered test is \"reliable\" in later stages of Lyme; however, as Green discusses at length in the above interview, this is not the case for many patients, for a number of reasons, one of which has to do with the many species and strains of Borrelia bacteria that may cause Lyme or \"Lyme-like illness,\" but which never will result in a positive Lyme disease blood test.\n\n(NatCapLyme has facilitated the passing of laws in Virginia and Maryland requiring that doctors inform patients about the failings of these tests, which usually are not explained to patients by doctors.)\n\nAlthough Fairfax, Virginia-based George Mason University and Ceres Nanosciences recently created a urine-based Lyme disease testthat was shown in a trial to be more accurate than the two-tiered Lyme disease test, the CDC still only endorses the traditional two-tiered ELISA + Western blot testing process. \"In general,\" Mead said, \"CDC recommends that people rely on FDA-approved tests for the diagnosis of Lyme disease.\"\n\nI contacted the CDC Clinician Outreach and Community Activity office to inquire about the urine-based test and received this reply from someone named Will (no last name was given):\n\n  ...we have not evaluated the Nanotrap(r) Lyme Antigen test. CDC supports the development of new testing methods for Lyme disease and encourages laboratories to submit their newly developed tests to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clearance in order to ensure that the highest quality diagnostic tests are available.\n\n(It is worth noting that the average cost to secure FDA approval of a new medical device is $24 million, which can present delays and sometimes even indefinitely prohibit creators of better and more accurate devices from securing FDA approval.)\n\nAccording to LymeDisease.org's Lorraine Johnson, the CDC did not officially reject non-FDA approved diagnostic tests until 2013. Johnson writes:\n\n  The CDC does not have jurisdiction over the FDA, of course. And, the FDA permits the marketing of tests that do not have FDA approval. Many tests on the market today fall in this category. What the announcement means is that physicians and insurers will be less likely to accept non-FDA approved tests. This means that patients who want these tests will need to pay for them out of pocket. It also means that the entrenched lab tests that simply do not work will have more of the market to themselves.\n\nThe Meade interview presents a perplexing dichotomy. Meade states--consistent with CDC's messaging--that the concern about Lyme disease specialists treating patients who have persisting symptoms is that \"there is no evidence\" (other than over 300 peer-reviewed, published articles) for Lyme bacteria that persist after short-term antibiotic treatment, and that patients are \"treated with therapies that are sometimes harmful. There are cases of patients who have died as a result of long-term therapies for Lyme disease.\" When citing these cases, the CDC never mentions, for example, cancer patients who are treated with chemotherapy for years and succumb to the illness, or to the poisonous treatment, anyway. The conversations, which sometimes invoke one or two anecdotes of patients who die, for example, from an infected IV port used to administer antibiotics, don't discuss that across the board, hospital mistakes are the third leading cause of deaths in the United States. The publisher of the cancer journal _Oncology_ states that \"infections are among the most common, potentially serious complications of cancer and its treatment\"--yet, the CDC doesn't recommend against chemotherapies for this reason, or because chemo often fails and is toxic to the body. The CDC and IDSA frequently use this argument against treatment Lyme disease patients.\n\nSimilarly paradoxical, CDC's current priority of raising awareness about and preventing the spread of Zika virus among the American population focuses--as the CDC should--on protecting the overall public health. Yet, CDC's approach to Lyme disease often is to refuse interviews that would serve to inform the public, to deny an abundant and growing body of evidence for persisting Lyme disease, and rather than focusing on raising awareness and containing the Lyme epidemic--the fastest-spreading bacterial infection in the country--CDC personnel and publications consistently cite chemotherapy-like risks to individual patients from treatment instead of, as it does with Zika and most other infectious diseases, focusing on containing the greater public health threat. This makes no sense.\n\nFOX5NY's Teresa Priolo asked Meade about patients who are misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis, ALS and other diseases and succumb directly or indirectly, and then are diagnosed after death with Lyme disease.\n\n\"Reports of cases of Lyme being mistaken for other diseases are really quite rare,\" Mead said. \"Some...patients were actually seriously harmed by being given a diagnosis and long-term therapy for Lyme disease when in fact their underlying condition went untreated.\"\n\nI can only speak anecdotally, but my story in a nutshell: I was diagnosed with and treated for Lyme in 1997, at age 18 or 19. Undertreated. By age 33, doctors thought I might have multiple sclerosis or possibly even ALS. Tests were inconclusive but ruled those out. At 36, I was re-diagnosed with Lyme, as well as bartonella and babesia coinfections. After approximately six months of antibiotic treatment, I was no longer semi-disabled. My recovery has continued.\n\nLast month, I met a young woman in her early 30s who was born ill. She was diagnosed at a young age with multiple sclerosis and treated for it. She was then un-diagnosed with MS and instead diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and treated with biologic medications. She was given a partial colectomy and treated with biologic medications that have destroyed her body. She could not turn her head without turning her whole body, and I heard her bones crack every time she moved a joint. She was ultimately diagnosed with Lyme disease, and it was determined that she was most likely born with it.\n\nI have met scores of people who were initially diagnosed with MS or another condition and then were found to have Lyme disease, underwent treatment, and recovered a great deal of wellness as a result. Based on my personal experience and my personal encounters, this is not a rare occurrence. With approximately 10,400 new cases of MS diagnosed each year, according to the CDC's own data, Lyme disease is 30 times more prevalent--and yet physicians continue to be encouraged to look for something, anything, other than Lyme disease when patients with symptoms that could be attributable to Lyme disease present. This is, by way of great understatement, nonsense.\n\nThank you, and congratulations, to FOX5NY, Teresa Priolo, and all others who are making real efforts to inform the public about this epidemic. This type of coverage is overdue, but it's more necessary than ever. For journalists who haven't scratched the surface of the complexities and controversies surrounding Lyme disease, read through these questions and start doing your homework. The success of FOX5NY's special report is evidence that the public is hungry for information about Lyme disease, recognizing the threat through word of mouth that cannot be contained.\n\nLyme is today's greatest medical mystery, and for any journalist with investigative instincts and an interest in uncovering the truth, the Lyme story is only beginning to be told.\n",

The remaining 123 places are then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earned quota places for their respective NPCs, though not necessarily for themselves.\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the Paralympic Games after the NPC has obtained a quota place, all archers must be classified with a confirmed or review sports status, to ensure Paralympic eligibility, and have achieved a minimum qualification score (MQS):\n\n-   Men's Ind. Compound W1: 575\n-   Men's Ind. Compound Open: 630\n-   Men's Ind. Recurve Open: 560\n-   Women's Ind. Compound W1: 500\n-   Women's Ind. Compound Open: 600\n-   Women's Ind. Recurve Open: 520\n\nThe MQS must have been achieved between 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016.\n\n\nTimeline\n\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| Event                 | Date                  | Venue                 |\n+=======================+=======================+=======================+\n| Start date for MQS    | 1 July 2015           | -                     |\n| performances          |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| 2015 Parapan American | 7–15 August 2015      | Toronto               |\n| Games                 |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| 2015 Para Archery     | 23–30 August 2015     | Donaueschingen        |\n| World Championships   |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| 2015 Asian            | November 2015         | Bangkok               |\n| qualification         |                       |                       |\n| event[1]              |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| 2016 European         | 2–10 April 2016       | Challans              |\n| qualification event   |                       |                       |\n| 2016 World Archery    |                       |                       |\n| Europe Para           |                       |                       |\n| Championships         |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| 2016 Final World      | tbc                   |                       |\n| qualification event   |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| Bipartite Commission  | 1 May 2016            |                       |\n| process               |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| End date for MQS      | 1 July 2016           | -                     |\n| performances          |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| Final deadline for    | 15 August 2016        | -                     |\n| entries               |                       |                       |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n\n\nQualification details\n\nPlaces are awarded to the NPC, not the individual athlete.

    "passage": "[MF] Painless enough\n\nWarning: a scene where a girl loses some body parts may be revolting.\n\n\n‘See here this is death.’ She pointed to a dark vaporous hole below us. Wisps of purple smoke circulated its edges before dissipating away. \n\n‘Death is that?’ I asked. ‘I always thought that death was going to be a white room of infinite dimensions.’\n\n’No one knows what death looks like beyond the hole. Death is this hole, but maybe there is a space beyond it that is white or red or green for that matter. No one has come back to tell about it.’\nI looked into the black-purple void, squinting at it scrutinizingly. I felt a shiver at the center of my chest, as I looked on.\n\n‘I’m cold,’ I said. I wondered if I was looking into a reflection of the emptiness inside of me, or as Virginia Woolf put it, a wedge-shaped core of darkness. It was an alluring darkness, however. If I looked closely enough, I could detect a dark whirl turning steadily at the center like the middle of a whirling body of water. I wanted to dip my face into the center and drink from it.\n\n‘Hey, what are you doing?’\n\nI realized that I had put my face inches away from the dark void.\n\n‘Oh,’ I said. ‘I don’t know. No, I didn’t mean to.’ I released a sigh of relief internally.\n\n‘If you’re really curious about the void, just try dipping in a finger. Going all in with your face is more regrettable.’\n\n‘Ok, you really mean? What will happen?’ I asked.\n\n‘I don’t know. It was just a suggestion. Don’t take it seriously.’ \n\nThe void was beginning to grow on me, feeling almost too familiar or comfortable. When I looked into the hypnotic black-purple, and once I got past the fear, I felt a sense of reassurance. ‘Try it,’ a voice urged me in my head.\n\nI took my left pointer finger and reached into the void, slipped it through the blackness until I could see that my finger was about half-way in. The darkness felt like a cool mist, not wet as I thought it would be. I let my finger dangle in the void for awhile until I was no longer sure whether it was still there or not. I took my finger out. A black mist was pouring out of the end of my finger from the middle joint, the lower half of my finger missing, or non-existent.\n\n‘Oh!’ I exclaimed, observing my finger.\n\n‘Hm, it seems like half of your finger has been lost in the void,’ she spoke matter-of-factly.\n\n‘Yeah,’ I said. It hadn’t even hurt. I tried moving my finger. It bend easily from the knuckle. The strange purplish vapor continued to emit from the end of my shortened finger. I looked down the finger but couldn’t see past the mist. In a risky move, I used my right hand to grasp my finger, effectively trapping the mist. But then, I noticed that the mist began seeping through the back of my hand, fire from a tiny pore between two knuckles and then from other pores that opened up in the back of my hand until the vapor appeared to be seeping out freely.\n\n‘Ahhh,’ I exclaimed, removing my hand from my finger. The palm of my hand looked my finger did, a black-purple mist covering the whole of the area where the mist had made contact with the skin. I wasn’t sure how much of my palm was left, as I couldn’t see through the mist. The back of my hand was covered in a misty swirl at certain points, so I was certain that most of my hand’s back still existed. \n‘It doesn’t hurt?’ she asked. \n\n‘No,’ I said. The only ameliorating fact was that I hadn’t felt any pain in the quick dissolving of my finger and palm. \n\n‘What will you do now?’ she asked.\n\n‘I don’t know.’ Knowing that the black void couldn’t be removed, or at least, not easily by simply covering it with something else, I thought about the permanent consequences carrying such a void could have. I wouldn’t be able to touch most things.\n\nThere was a rock on the ground. I tried picking it up with my blackened palm. It vanished in the darkness. I tried merely pressing my palm onto the ground. A small, round crater was left when I removed my hand. I tried slipping my hand into a mitten. The void ate the cloth before it was even fully on.\n\nFrom now on, I would have to be careful about what I touched, as there was no way of getting around the void in either hand. I wasn’t sure if I could write or type anymore.\nI sat on the ground. \n\n‘What are you doing?’ she asked.\n\n’Please don’t try to do anything, since I’m going to do something dangerous,’ I said.\n\nI clasped my hands together, the void in my right palm quickly transforming my left one into a similar dark mass. I let the darkness eat through the matter in both hands until they were gaseous masses.\nI curled up my legs and grabbed each shoe with a hand each. Each foot disappeared and was replaced by a black mass that was climbing like a fire up my shins, consuming pants matter, bone, blood, vessel and everything. I felt the pounding in my chest grow stronger, although I suspected it was not from the sudden cutoff of a vital circulatory pathway rather than from an atavistic anxiety that was beginning to emerge now that a few of my limbs were gone.\n\nMy legs contained the energy of a firecracker, dissipating smoke into the night.\n \nI put my fist, or the void left in its place, through my chest. It passed easily through. I would be lying if I said I hadn’t felt anything. Pushing the fist through my heart was painless enough; only, the throbbing heartbeat that I had felt through my body had stopped. I wondered if I would die soon now that my body had no pulse. I was still breathing, still sitting upright, still conscious. This wasn’t right. I had displaced my heart and still some magic was keeping me alive. Or was I alive? \n\nI looked at her. Her expression hadn’t changed. Those dark pupils stared on curiously, or boredly, at the disembodied figure of myself, black vapors spewing out from its body at random openings. \n\n‘Am I alive?’ I asked her.\n\n‘As far as I can tell, but  as I don’t know the details of the void, I cannot say with certainty,’ she replied. Her answer was evasive as usual.\n\nI sat there, unmoving. Nothing. I felt the same. I looked over the edge into the black void, the center turning steadily.\n\n‘What are you thinking?’ she asked.\n\n‘I’m thinking,’ I started, ‘that the void looks awfully peaceful.’\n\nThere was a pause. ‘So you’re thinking about jumping?’\n\nI looked at her. She seemed slightly concerned in her demeanor, which had shifted a little, odd for a girl who had little issue with taking me here in the first place.\n\n‘Yeah. Well, there’s no reversal of this void, and the way I am now…’ My voice trailed off. The black-purple darkness in my chest emanated silently. ‘Maybe, this is my real heart,’ I thought. ‘Maybe my spirit runs on this darkness.’\n\nI considered briefly trying to displace my head, too, but hesitated upon seeing the purple masses move toward me. Also, what if my body still survived, somehow functioning without head or heart, but my consciousness was displaced? Then, I would become nothing short of a mindless, mutilated body, either waiting itself out by the cliff for eternity or crawling around on the limbs that remained, perhaps even becoming a danger to others should they appear.\n\nOverlooking the void, I thought about the simple move I could make; a quick exertion of strength from my elbows would send me toppling over right into the pit of the void. It wasn’t hard. I couldn’t be sure of the effect the void of have on me, if it would keep me alive somehow, or if I would finally disappear, body and mind, into the thick of its vapors. If she was right, after all, the void was death, so that much I could be sure of. Or could I? The void might’ve symbolized death to her knowledge, but she also didn’t know its contents beyond that, or if there is something other than it on the other side. ‘No one has come back to tell about it,’ she had said.\n\nI sensed her a little closer behind me now. It was time.\n\n‘Good-bye,’ I said. There was no reply. I half-wondered or fantasized whether she might grasp my arm and prevent me from going, though she showed no such display of emotion. Emotion was not our strong suit.\n\nI leaned over, and with a swift push from my elbows, moved my body over the ledge, headfirst, falling rapidly, more rapidly than I—\n",

    "passage": "Jimmy Taber\nMasters of Business Administration 2011\nThe Heller School for Social Policy and Management\nMA in Jewish Professional Leadership 2011\nHornstein School for Jewish Professional Leadership\nBrandeis University\n\n“As I reflect on my coming of age in New Jersey, I realize that I had always been in some sense more of a ‘girl’ than a ‘boy.’…I didn’t think of myself so much as girlish but rather as Jewish…I start with what I think is a widespread sensibility that being Jewish in our culture renders a boy effeminate. Rather than producing in me a desire to ‘pass’ and to become a ‘man,’ this sensibility resulted in my desire to remain a Jew, where being a sissy was alright.”[1]\n\n-Daniel Boyarin\n\n_Unheroic Conduct_\n\n The recent recognition of a gender imbalance in American Jewish communal life has sparked a panic within the community. According to Sylvia Fishman and Daniel Parmer, the American Jewish community has become “feminized,” driving men from organized communal participation.[2] Widespread efforts to reincorporate men into communal life have ensued. While well intentioned, current attempts to specifically involve men in the Jewish community are misguided as they serve to reify dominant gender power structures that undermine Jewishness as a positive masculine identity. Instead of seeking to validate white masculinity, a fundamental shift in Jewish male self understanding is required in order for Jewishness to be realized as a viable challenge to the dominant society’s patriarchy.\n\nTHE FEMINIZATION OF JEWISHNESS\n\nPrior to Jewish emancipation, Jewish masculinity was constructed within the context of the isolated Jewish community. As Melissa Raphael notes, “Jewish masculinity is not traditionally defined economically by a man’s being the main bread-winner or by macho physical prowess but by the prestige of his religious scholarship.”[3] While this understanding of masculinity stands in stark contrast to dominant masculine ideals, it did not conflict with Jewish males’ self conception because Jews were largely isolated from dominant European society. Jewish men could be both fully male and Jewish within the context of the Jewish community.\n\nFollowing Jewish emancipation, the dominant European discourse’s application of feminine qualities to Jewish men began to become problematic as Jewish men were presented with the opportunity to assimilate and participate fully in greater European society. Judith Butler notes, “Becoming a man…requires a repudiation of femininity.”[4] For Jewish men this formula proved problematic as Jewish male identity had historically been constructed by the dominant gender discourse as feminine and thus incompatible and even antithetical to normative white masculinity. Otto Weininger’s study of male and female difference published just before his suicide in 1903 entitled _Sex and Character_ exemplifies the conflation of Jewish and female identity in dominant European discourse.[5] As Sander Gilman explains, “Central to Weininger’s study of the relationship between the masculine and the feminine is the dichotomy between the Jew and the Aryan… (he) simply extended the category of the feminine to the Jew.”[6] Identifying Jews with women served to reify the Jew’s position as subordinate within both European racial and gender hierarchies. Intertwining Jewish racial and gender identities made it impossible for Jewish men to become full males in the European context and remain Jewish.\n\nIn traditional pre-emancipation Jewish communities, men were primarily responsible for communal continuity through the transmission of religious tradition through textual learning. As Jewish men sought to become members of the dominant European society they were “forced” to disassociate themselves from their Jewishness. Thus, the responsibility for Jewish continuity shifted to Jewish women. Paula Hyman writes, “Western Jewish communities adopted the dominant middle-class view that women were responsible for inculcating moral and religious consciousness in their children and within the home more generally. According to this view, women were the primary factor in the formation of their children’s Jewish identity.”[7] This shift of responsibility from men to women freed Jewish men to shed their Jewishness in favor of full male identities within the dominant society. Outside of Orthodox communities, traditional models of Jewish masculinity were widely abandoned in favor of assimilation.\n\nCONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDINGS OF MEN’S ABSENCE FROM JEWISH LIFE AND EFFORTS TO REENGAGE MEN\n\nThe lack of male participation in contemporary Jewish communal life is well documented, especially among the liberal denominations. In 2007, it was noted that within the Reform movement only 22-43% of youth group participants were boys and 33% of rabbinic students at Hebrew Union College were men.[8] Fishman and Parmer write, “Nationally, girls and women outnumber men in weekly non-Orthodox worship services, in adult education classes, in volunteer leadership positions, and in Jewish cultural events.”[9] Concern about the absence of men in organized Jewish life has become an issue of widespread communal concern.\n\n Instead of pointing to the historical abandonment of Jewishness by Jewish men as outlined above, the lack of men in Jewish communal life is often understood to be the result of the increased role of women. Fishman and Parmer summarize this perspective as follows:\n\nWhen it comes to gender equality or gender balance, contemporary American Jewish life is caught between a rock and a hard place: Traditional public Judaism was and is dominated by men, while contemporary liberal American Judaism, although supposedly egalitarian, is visibly and substantially feminized. Jewish activities from the broad grassroots to the elite echelons of liberal Jewish religious leadership have become devalued, a typical result of feminization.[10]\n\nWhile Fishman and Parmer are correct that Jewish leadership and participation has “become devalued,” it is not a result of the increased participation of women, but the shift of responsibility for Jewish continuity to women and subsequent male abandonment of Jewishness in favor of dominant masculinity.\n\n Current efforts to attract Jewish men to the organized Jewish community have focused on appealing to men’s sense of dominant masculinity. There has been a proliferation of programs exemplified by the Lincoln Park Jewish Center’s Cigar, Scotch, and Torah Group that specifically target men with the implicit assumption that Jewishness itself is not enough of an attraction.[11] By infusing elements constructed as exclusively masculine, such as cigars and scotch, the Jewish community is attempting to create a synthesis of Jewishness and masculinity that will root men in Jewish communal life. The idea is that men will initially come for the masculine “fun” and then come back for the meaning that Jewishness offers. This approach is problematic as it fails to recognize the fundamental incongruence between Jewishness and dominant masculinity.\n\n Similarly, Moving Traditions’ Campaign for Jewish Boys represents a national effort to engage young boys in Jewish life. In the pilot stage, the program “seeks to reverse boys’ mass exit from and dissatisfaction with Jewish life.”[12] This program also utilizes dominant models of masculinity for engagement providing “content that…gives boys the opportunity to explore issues they care about, such as friendship, sex, power, money, and work.”[13] This approach is bound to reap limited success due to the flawed assumption that the flight from Jewishness can be stemmed by infusing dominant masculinity. As long as masculinity is constructed in opposition to the femininity of Jewishness, the two identities are mostly mutually exclusive.\n\n Fishman and Parmer‘s research findings exemplify the Jewish community’s problematic approach to attracting men. They write, “Synagogues and Jewish communal organizations need to find ways to balance the moral principles of egalitarianism with the psycho-social needs of boys and men to spend meaningful Jewish time in gendered peer groups.”[14] Egalitarianism is not the root of the problem. Men are not uncomfortable with Jewishness because of the prominence of women in communal life. Jewishness as an identity is incompatible with dominant forms of masculinity. Consequently, “gendered peer groups” do not serve to address the root causes of the problem.\n\nA CRITIQUE OF CURRENT APPROACHES AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n Current communal efforts to attract men to the organized Jewish community do not provide effective ways for Jewish men to build Jewish male identities because of the failure to create an explicitly Jewish alternative to dominant masculinity. If ethnic or racial Jewish identity is understood as inherently feminine, it is fundamentally incompatible with dominant masculinity. Thus, attempts to synthesize dominant masculinity and Jewish identity are bound to attain only marginal success. If, as Judith Butler argues, “Masculine and feminine are not dispositions…but accomplishments,”[15] the Jewish male’s abandonment of Jewishness can be viewed within the context of an active attainment of dominant masculinity. The question remains: What is meaningful about Jewish identity? Masculinity offers men a privileged position within a gendered society. Power and control are inherent within this identity. In order for men to abandon the privileges of masculinity, Jewishness must offer something compelling in return.\n\nExamples of the Jewish community seeking to construct alternative Jewish male identities do not exist on a widespread programmatic level, but glimpses of the power of embracing Jewishness as a challenge to masculinity exist within the Jewish community’s current efforts to attract men. While the Campaign for Jewish Boys’ curriculum focuses on utilizing dominant masculinity to engage Jewish boys, the organization has recognized, consciously or not, that boys who value their Jewishness are drawn to this identity through and alternative gender discourse.[16] Moving Traditions found in its 2007 focus groups found that for “’Jewishly-affirming’ teenage boys…Judaism provides some boys with resilience, an ‘alternative’ masculinity, and an opportunity to express a sense of self.”[17] Jewish boys recognize that this “alternative masculinity” provides meaning. Instead of attempting to reinscribe dominant constructions of masculinity, the Campaign for Jewish Boys specifically, and the Jewish community generally, should embrace Jewishness as an ethno-gender identity.\n\nUltimately, it is up to Jewish community as a whole and Jewish men as individuals to reevaluate the significance and value of dominant masculinity. Absent this self reflection, the current efforts of the Jewish community to attract men will only serve to reify the troubling gender power structures that have provided the impetus for Jewish men’s abandonment of Jewishness. As long as dominant masculine identity is privileged over Jewishness, Jewish men will largely remain wary of “coming out” Jewish. Jewish communal efforts should focus on illustrating the value and meaning of Jewishness as an identity in order to create a more complete community.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBoyarin, Daniel. _Unheroic Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the\n_\n\n_Jewish Man._ Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997.\n\nButler, Judith. “Melancholy Gender/Refused Identification.” In _Constructing Masculinity_,\n\nedited by Maurice Berger, Brian Wallis, and Simon Watson.

    "passage": "In April of 1969, work began on what would one day be the internet. Back then, it was known as ARPAnet, and it existed for the scientists of the US Government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. They planned to share scientific papers, commentary, and ideas, across an internet that looked like this:\n\n[The Internet 1977]\n\n_A map of the ENTIRE internet circa 1977._\n\nYep, that’s the whole thing.\n\nFast forward to now, and the internet is everywhere and everything. It’s hard to imagine life without it, even if you actually remember life without it. It’s easy to feel that the web we know was created by visionaries who saw the big picture.\n\nIn fact, some of the most important parts of the web essentially just happened. Others were created to solve immediate problems, using the tools at hand.\n\nThe road to post-Owl Google from the World Wide Web project isn’t straight. But it does have some fascinating insights into how our online world took on its present shape. And if you’ve ever measured visitor behavior, optimized a website, worked with a team, created content or sent a marketing email, a lot of it looks eerily familiar.\n\n[Old School World Wide Web]\n_Source_\n\n\n1. Hyperlinks\n\nHyperlinks are blue for two reasons, depending on who you believe.\n\nSome people will point you to the earliest web browsers, like Mosaic for Windows:\n\n[NCSA Mosaic MS Windows]\n\n_Source_\n\nBlue looks like a default choice. The background is already gray, the text is already black, and light colors don’t show up well on a black/white color scheme. So the options were red, blue and green.\n\nThat’s where the theorizing starts.\n\nRed and green are detected by the same cells in the eye, and one of the most common forms of colorblindness is red-green colorblindness. It affects 7% of men and only 0.4% of women, but that’s still one person in 25 overall. So it made sense to choose a color that everyone could see and not mistake for black.\n\nAs Joe Clarke explains, in his book _Building Accessible Websites_ (2002):\n\n  Red and green are the colors most affected by color-vision deficiency.  Almost no one has a blue deficiency. Accordingly, nearly everyone can  see blue, or, more accurately, almost everyone can distinguish blue as a color different from others.\n\nThat would make sense: and it is the reason other parts of the web are blue – like Facebook, which is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind.\n\nSo there was a meeting where all the DARPAnet people and the early net pioneers all sat around a table and talked about which color to make links, and they decided on blue because of accessibility issues?\n\nIf only.\n\nThat’s not the way Tim Berners-Lee remembers it.\n\nMore than any single person, Tim Berners-Lee is responsible for inventing the internet. And blue hyperlinks? He doesn’t even remember who chose the color.\n\n‘There is no reason why one should use color, or blue, to signify links: it is just a default,’ Berners-Lee told a Q&A at the World Wide Web Consortium. ‘I think the first WWW client (WorldWideWeb I wrote for the NeXT) used just underline to represent a link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn’t used much in real documents.’\n\nThat jibes with what Ted Nelson, also a net pioneer, remembers. In 1965, he told Mashable’s Lance Ulanoff, ‘links were visible straps between pages,’ nothing more, and there was no question of what color to make them since ‘color screens were not on the horizon.’\n\nIn fact, recalls Berners-Lee, ‘blue came in as browsers went color — I don’t remember which was the first to use blue… My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least.’\n\nSo it’s not even his choice – and if it had been, it would have been his second choice. ‘I used green whenever I could in the early WWW design, for nature and because it is supposed to be relaxing.’\n\n(If you feel the same way Tim does, and prefer your links green or some other color, check out this guide to changing their color.)\n\n\n2. SPAM\n\nI think spam deserves caps. The average adult now receives nearly 150 emails a day – how many of these are actually real communication, part of a real conversation that you’re actually interested and involved in?\n\nAnd how many are just someone yelling in your ear about stuff?\n\n[Email Breakdown]\n_Source_\n\nNot always coherently either.\n\nThe glory days of the weird, spam-detector-dodging subject line (Unl!kel¥ Médiç@7 Pr0c£dure, anyone?) may be behind us. But a whole lot of unsolicited, unwanted communications – a specific form of digital garbage, to all intents and purposes – still washes into the average inbox daily.\n\nSo where does spam come from, historically?\n\nThere’s now a spam family – neologisms to further differentiate between different types of spam. Spam is an email you didn’t ask for and didn’t want. Famspam is the same stuff, but from your family. Bacn, meanwhile, is spam you did ask for, but don’t want. (Suggestion, courtesy of Buzz Canuck: Prosciutto, for spam you didn’t ask for, but do want.)\n\nSpam is a verb, a noun, an adverb and an adjective: you can spammily spam with spammy spam. (Don’t, though.)\n\nBut where did the spam story start?\n\nSpam goes back to the days of ARPAnet. It’s older than the web, older than browsers, older than search engines. The first ever spam email was sent to every address on an ARPAnet mailing list, advertising a sales presentation for a computer:\n\n[Digital product presentation]\n_Source_\n\nSent to around 400 email addresses by Gary Thuerk, a marketer at Digital Equipment Corporation in 1978, the message created effects that seem very familiar. Thuerk didn’t see himself as a spammer: ‘I think of myself as the father of e-marketing. There’s a difference,’ he told Computer World in 2007. ‘E-spam,’ as Thuerk charmingly calls it, is sent to unqualified recipients who don’t want the message or the product it espouses. Thuerk’s message can’t have been spam, he says, because ‘we sold $13 million or $14 million worth’ of DEC computers on the back of it.\n\nBut as well as generating sales, Thuerk’s message generated a negative response: complaints began arriving daily from vexed ARPAnetters who didn’t want their inboxes cluttered, especially with materials that weren’t directly related to research for the US Army.\n\n[Arpanet Management Branch]\n_Source_\n\nARPAnet users resented being distracted from crucial research, not from checking Facebook at work or shopping for sneakers on eBay. But apart from that, the more things change…\n\n\n3. Wikipedia\n\n[Wikipedia]\n\nScourge of college professors, a boon to people who don’t know something but would like to, and a solid source of link juice for marketers: the web seems unthinkable without Wikipedia. For one thing, the top SERPs would look a lot different.\n\nFounders Jimmy Wales and Larry Sangford started Wikipedia in 2001, under what Sangford thought was ‘a silly name for… a very silly project.’ The name portmanteaus ‘wiki’ with ‘encyclopedia,’ for an encyclopedia written by its readers.\n\n‘The important part of wikis—what makes them different from any other type of website—is collaborative editing by the users,’ explains Zach LeBar.\n\nAt traditional encyclopedias, the staff uses the best information from reputable sources, overseen by editors who are subject matter experts with multi-decade careers or advanced degrees in their subjects. Maybe ‘[Encyclopedia] Britannica has long fostered vigorous interaction between its staff and its advisers, contributors, and audience,’ but they’re not talking about the kind of interaction that Rick Kay has with Jimmy Wales.\n\nWhat makes Wikipedia interesting is that it works even though no-one works there (with the exception of a single software engineer), it’s accurate (generally) even though its staff aren’t officially subject matter experts, it’s well staffed even though it doesn’t have any staff, and its articles are edited so democratically that Wikians don’t simply vote on articles. Instead, there’s a dialogue that seeks a ‘good enough’ consensus according to the Wikipedia rules.\n\nWikipedia works on a mish-mash of social styles. A majority of voters isn’t enough to change or delete articles. Some users have a louder voice than others, but only so long as they don’t use it. Most importantly, the mix of work and management styles is there to facilitate getting things done: ‘the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it,’ Wales told a TED audience.\n\n\n4. Linux\n\nLinux is the kind of OS that couldn’t exist without the web. Its creator, Linus Torvalds, an American-Finnish software engineer, wrote the original 10,000 lines of code for the system; it now stands at almost 22 million lines of code, created and added by more than 5,000 individuals representing nearly 500 corporations.\n\n[Company Changes Percent]\n_Source_\n\nAnd unseen, unheard, it’s everywhere. You’re almost certainly using it right now: even if you’re reading this on a Windows or Mac machine (and not an Android or Chrome device running a Linux derivative), you’re probably connecting to a Linux server to see it. It also runs a few other things, like the stock exchange, Google, Facebook, Amazon, ‘and much, much more,’ says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation.\n\nLinux is an example of the web building itself, the inspiration for a million overheated conversations about self-assembling systems. But what’s the vision behind it?\n\nThere isn’t one.\n\n‘I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I’m an engineer.’ Rather than looking at the clouds, says Torvalds, ‘I’m looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that’s right in front of me before I fall in. This is the kind of person I am.’\n\nLinux grew out of the opportunity for thousands of people, all over the world, to work on something that fixed their potholes – and helped others fix theirs at the same time. Amazon, Facebook, eBay and others collaborate to improve Linux, which they then use to compete with each other.\n\n\n5. Blogs\n\nBlogging is one of the main things the internet is for. Reading and publishing blogs takes up a pretty big chunk of the internet. Check out how the audience for blogs has grown since 2006:\n\n[October 2006 chart]\n_Source_\n\nAnd they’re getting a constant stream of content to read and look at too. These two images, from World of Meters (actually, from their blog) were taken ten seconds apart:\n\n[Blog posts written today]\n[Blog posts written today 2]\n\nThat’s a lot of blogging. Safe to say, it’s an established thing. Where did it come from?\n\nThe first blog to call itself a blog was Robot Wisdom, run by Jorn Barger. Essentially, he shared and curated links – he ‘logged’ the web as he browsed it, which is where the word ‘blog’ comes from. Distinct from a personal website or homepage, it wasn’t an online calling card or a piece of real estate so much as it was a participation in a conversation. That fits with Barger’s past: ex-commune dwelling hippie, by the late 80s Jorn was a Usenet junkie. Picture a barebones, text-only forum. That was Usenet, long before there was broadband or even domain names.\n\nAfter falling in with Usenet, Barger fell out with some Usenetters. The Kate Bush fan forum was a particular source of friction. (Yes, really.) So he looked for a place where he could write, communicate and comment on his own terms.\n\nHe came up with a webpage that would link out – to other pages on the same site, or to other sites. New entries would appear at the top, so scrolling down meant going backward in time and the freshest content was always served first.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n[Robot Wisdom Auxilary]\n_Source_\n\nBut that doesn’t actually look, or work, a whole lot like the blogs we know now.\n\nWhat took blogs from being a menace serious enough to make Forbes print this:\n\n[Forbes attack of the blogs]\n_Source_\n\n…to the situation we have now, where Forbes is one of the millions of business blogs?\n\nThe factors that would make blogs the key medium of our time were already in place early on. But the innovation that made the difference was based on information about visitor behavior: long before it became a catchphrase, the adoption of blogging as an approach to web publishing was data driven.\n\nHere’s how it happened. Magazines like _Wired_ had moved online – when you put William Gibson on the cover, you kind of have to react when _Neuromancer_ looks like it’s coming true. _Slate, Urban Desires_ and more were there too. But they’d all stuck with their magazine format. The front page told you what was inside, and the new ‘issue’ was ‘published’ weekly or monthly, all at once.\n\nThe editors of _Suck_, a brash satirical magazine site that also pioneered the use of hypertext as emphasis or commentary, analysed the server logs of _Hotwired_, the website of _Wired_ magazine, to see how visitors behaved on the site.What they found was that people only came to the site when there was something new to see. With the restraints of physical publishing gone, reasoned editor-founders Carl Steadman and Joey Anuff, there was no reason not to publish constantly, every weekday.\n\nAnd after they started doing it, everybody else joined in. The blog as we know it was fully formed.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Internet we’ve come to recognize has actually been assembled on the fly, often by people who were trying to do something else. There’s no grand plan. Instead, people wanted an operating system that ran light and fast, or more buyers for their computer business, or somewhere to talk about Kate Bush, so they made it happen. And the web itself allowed those things to spread. You can start that conversation about self-assembling systems now, if you like.\n\n-   Author\n-   Recent Posts\n\n[]\n\nRichard Bayston creates copy and content at RBCopywriting.com, mostly about tech, digital marketing and content strategy.

    "passage": "OTTAWA—The marathon election campaign will be a test of more than voters’ patience and attention span.\n\nIt will be a test of the Fair Elections Act, the controversial and sweeping legislation that has introduced changes to how Canadians prove they are eligible to vote, the way elections are financed and how voting shenanigans are investigated.\n\nIt puts more money in the pockets of political parties for a longer campaign, while capping how much third parties can spend on election advertising.\n\nTo its boosters, the changes are a necessary update, motivated in part by the need to guard against voting fraud.\n\n“I think we have a reasonable package that enables everyone to vote while protecting the integrity of the system,” Pierre Poilievre, Conservative candidate and democratic reform minister, told the Star in an interview.\n\nHowever, critics of the legislation fear some of the changes will leave people in some particular groups — such as students, the homeless and First Nations — unable to vote. Critics argue that many of the changes were deliberately designed to skew the advantage in favour of the Conservatives on Election Day.\n\n“There’s no question it will have an impact in the current election,” said Garry Neil, executive director of the Council of Canadians.\n\nEven Marc Mayrand, the chief electoral officer, has warned that some of the changes “will not serve Canadians well.”\n\nThe so-called Fair Elections Act stirred controversy from the moment it was introduced in February 2014. At the time, Poilievre said the law would put “special interests on the sidelines and rule-breakers out of business.”\n\nBut academics, students and other concerned groups came forward to warn that the changes would actually make it harder for some Canadians to cast a ballot.\n\nFor example, the law prohibits the use of the voter information card as a document that can be used as proof of residency. This has sparked concerns that some voters — notably students living away from home, seniors in long-term care homes and aboriginals — may lack the necessary identification, which must show their address, to vote.\n\nThere have also been changes to vouching, where one voter with proper identification could vouch for the identity of another voter at the polling station. An estimated 120,000 Canadians used vouching to vote in 2011.\n\n“We can expect that a significant proportion of them would not be able to vote under the rules proposed,” Mayrand told a parliamentary committee in March 2014.\n\nMayrand noted that the worry around Canadian elections wasn’t fraud, but declining turnout.\n\n“It is essential to understand that the main challenge for our electoral democracy is not voter fraud, but voter participation,” Mayrand told MPs.\n\nEliminating vouching and the information card would do little to improve the integrity of the voting process but “have taken away the ability of many qualified electors to vote,” he said.\n\nThat concern is echoed by Bilan Arte, national chairwoman of the Canadian Federation of Students, who said young people may lack the necessary ID that shows their identity and address.\n\nThat’s because they can find themselves living in two or three locations over the course of a year as they go between home, school and a job.\n\n“The proof of address is particularly a challenge for young people,” Arte said.\n\nIn a pilot project in the last election, some 400,000 voters used the voter information card as valid ID. “It’s a very significant piece of ID that is utilized by a lot of Canadians, notably young people,” she told the Star.\n\nRemoving the information card as a valid form of ID will make it “significantly more difficult . . . for young people and for those other demographics to be able to participate in the electoral process,” she said.\n\n“The arguments that the government is making is really just smoke and mirrors for an agenda that is about suppressing the votes of young people,” Arte said.\n\nArte said this is especially worrisome at a time when overall voter turnout is declining — it was 61 per cent in the 2011 election — and is even worse among younger voters.\n\nThe students federation and the Council of Canadians went to court seeking an injunction on two key elements of the act — disallowing the use of the voter information card as proof of identification to vote and the removal of vouching.\n\nThe legal bid failed but the applicants say they intend to continue their court challenge of the law after the election.\n\nNeil, of the Council of Canadians, said that evidence produced at the injunction hearing suggested that tens of thousands of Canadians could be barred from voting because of the changes introduced by the act.\n\nThe groups most vulnerable are youth, First Nations, marginalized people like the homeless and seniors, he said. With the exception of seniors, the others are “far more likely to vote non-Conservative,” he said.\n\n“It is the government of the day, with a majority, which is trying to write election rules that are going to favour that party and their candidates. There’s no question about it,” Neil said.\n\nNeil is also concerned that the new legislation restricts the ability of Elections Canada and the chief electoral officer to speak out on election issues, either to encourage turnout or alert voters to potential troubles, like the misdirecting robocalls of the 2011 vote.\n\nPoilievre downplayed the concerns and said he has no worries that a voter will be left unable to cast a ballot in the coming vote.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...\n\n“I’m not troubled. I haven’t met anybody who says they’re going to have a problem voting. I’m pretty confident that everybody has some shred of paper with their name on it,” he said.\n\nA driver’s licence alone will suffice. For those lacking a licence, there are more than 40 other possible ways to prove ID — a voter would have to show two pieces of accepted ID and one must show his or her current address.\n\n“I think we’re in good shape,” Poilievre said.\n\nHe also defended the restrictions on Elections Canada’s ability to speak out.\n\n“I think it’s probably in the interests of the agency to focus its communications on the nuts and bolts of voting and leave the rest to civil society and political parties. The role of Elections Canada is to inform and the role of political actors is to motivate the voter,” Poilievre said.\n\nArte said the student federation, which represents more than 500,000 people nationwide, is working to boost student participation in the upcoming vote by hosting candidates’ debates on campuses and pressing the political parties to engage on issues important to young people, like post-secondary education.\n\nShe said the federation is working to improve awareness among students on how they can vote.\n\n“We’re doing our best to ensure that young people are getting to the polls and are able to navigate a system that has thus far been designed to make it harder for them to vote,” Arte said.\n\nELECTION DAY BY THE NUMBERS\n\n60,000: Number of ballot boxes\n\n20,000: Number of polling locations\n\n120,000: Minimum number of polling station staff, with 250,000 staff retained for the election.\n\n$375 million: Elections Canada’s budget for the election, based on 37-day campaign. The actual cost will be higher.\n\n5 CONCERNS ABOUT THE FAIR ELECTIONS ACT\n\n1. Voter information card: The law prohibits the use of the voter information card as a document that can be used as proof of residency. This has sparked concerns that some voters — notably students living away from home, seniors in long-term care homes and aboriginals — may lack the necessary ID showing their address needed to vote.\n\n2. Vouching: Previously, one voter with proper identification could vouch for the identity of another at the polling station. The Conservatives had originally wanted to ban the practice outright but softened their stance after criticism the move would prevent some Canadians — an estimated 120,000, according to Elections Canada — from voting. Now voters will still require some ID to prove their identity but can have another elector vouch for their address.\n\n3. Advance polls: Canadians will have an extra day to vote in advance polls. The act sets out four advance polling days — 10, nine, eight and seven days in advance of Election Day. That means Canadians can vote on Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n4. Elections Canada: Critics say the law limits what the independent agency can publicly say about elections, such as efforts to encourage voter turnout. In the face of criticism, the Conservatives loosened the leash a bit but the head of Elections Canada is still limited to speaking on five topics: how to become a candidate; how to get on the list of electors; how to vote; what is needed to vote; and the services available to assist voters with disabilities.\n\n5. Finances: The act allows political parties to spend more if campaigns go longer than 37 days, a big factor in the current 78-day campaign. That means the political parties running candidates in all 338 federal ridings could spend up to $54.5 million, up from $25 million allowed in a 37-day campaign. That gives an advantage to the deep-pocketed Conservatives. At the same time, the act imposes spending limits on third parties on election advertising — in this longer campaign, the third-party limits are $439,410 and $8,788 per riding.\n\n__\n\n_—BRUCE CAMPION-SMITH_\n\n\n",

    "passage": "Nate, Part 1\n\nForeword: I used to consider writing a novel, but I always got distracted wanting to write about side-quests and secondary characters, and couldn't keep myself to just the one path I wanted to focus on. So I thought, instead, I would try this. I will be (hopefully) writing a series of short stories, such as this one, about several people, whose lives will intertwine. The story will be about these select individuals developing extroadinary abilities, super powers, and how they come to terms with them. The story will revolve around them discovering their abilities, and trying to learn how to use them, where they come from, and what to do with them. I hope that by being able to make several short stories, all linked together, I will be able to write a story I've been trying to write in novel form, because now I can explore all those side quests. Please, give me any and all feedback you may have. This is a first for me, and I hope that some of you enjoy it.\n\n \n\n \n\nNate, Part 1\n\n \n\nIt was hot. Far to hot to be stuck outside on the bleachers, watching the stupid football team strutting around. However, Nate was left with no other choice than to sit in the stands and cheer for his school team, just like everyone else. School spirit was mandatory, even if they had to force it from him. So there he sat, wishing he could be at home, playing video games, or reading a good book, or really anything outside of this damned heat.\n\n \n\nSuddenly the stands around him erupted in cheers. Nate forced himself to check back into reality, to see what was going on. His guess was his team had just scored a base, or a basket, or a touchdown, or whatever the goal of football was. He thought about trying to sneak out, but being caught ditching out on a game was worse then ditching a class.\n\n \n\n\"God, what a stupid school\" he thought to himself. \"They care more about the football team than they do about the students grades. I can't wait to get out of this stupid school, and this stupid town.\"\n\n \n\nNate had been born and raised in this small rural town of Chesterville, in the prairie's of Alberta, Canada. In his eighteen years, he had never left. He dreamed of the day he could graduate from the High School, and go off to College in the big city. Somewhere were football wasn't the only thing the town cared about. He started mentally checking off everything he had to do that night.\n\n \n\n\"Ok, the English paper is due tomorrow, but I'm almost done that\" he thought. \"I'll just give it one more quick re-read before I hand it in. The science homework won't take too long, so I'll have time to study for that math test tomorrow. Ah, crap, I almost forgot. I have to work tonight. Well, I guess it'll be another long night then\".\n\n \n\nAs the crowds erupted in cheers around him again, he didn't even bother to try and zone back. He just stared blindly forward, lost in his own world.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\n \n\nA few hours later, he had just gotten home. He looked at the clock, trying to see if he'd have time for a fast shower before work. He felt gross and sweaty from sitting in the heat all day, but there was nothing to be done about it. He grabbed his uniform and ran back out the door.\n\n \n\nWithout a car, he had to peddle his bike back through the heat all the way across town to the Wendy's. By the time he finally got to work, he was panting, and sweat was pouring down his back. He went straight to the employee bathroom and did what he could to wipe himself down with a wad of cool, wet paper towel. Putting his uniform on, he entered the always sweltering hot kitchen and swiped into work.\n\n \n\nHe hated his job, every minute he was there. It was hot, it was uncomfortable, it was boring and routine. Every night he worked he went home stinking of grease and hamburger. The shirts were made of some terrible plasticy feeling material that just felt awful whenever it touched your sweaty skin. But, if he wanted any hope of ever leaving this god-forsaken town, he had no choice. He was saving every penny he could for a college fund. His parent's weren't able to help much, being barely able to make ends meet as it was. At least he knew that graduation wasn't very far away now, and then one last summer of working in this dump to save up the money and he could move. Move far away. He could go to college and make something of himself. He was already accepted to a first year Engineering degree, and he had big plans for his life. Get a good job. Make a lot of money. Buy a big house. Find a wife, kids, picket fence. Be able to afford a vacation. Travel. Be able to give his kids a vehicle when they turned 16, and not have them need to worry about every cent for any chance to go to college.\n\n \n\nHe went through his shift on auto pilot, dreaming of the future. They were short staffed, again, as some of his fellow schoolmates hadn't bothered showing up for their shifts. Undoubtedly off celebrating their football win. Didn't even have the respect to phone in ahead of time. He was ran off his feet until almost closing time, trying to do the work of three people, with an overbearing, overweight, power-tripping asshole of a manager breathing down his neck the entire night.\n\n \n\nAs ten o'clock rolled around, Nate got ready to lock the doors. Once they were locked up and the dinning room was cleaned, he could go home. If he got out by ten thirty, he could be home for eleven, which would give him a few hours to study if he was ok with only five hours sleep. He locked the first door, but then heard the second entrance open up. He turned around to face a group of at least twenty to twenty-five of his fellow classmates. All cheering and high fiving each other, being very loud and obnoxious.\n\n \n\n\"Hey guys, sorry, you're too late\" he told the teenagers. \"We're closed up for the night.\"\n\n \n\n\"Well, it doesn't seem that way to me,\" said one of the group, whom Nate recognized as Mike, the quarterback of the football team. \"See, the door was open.\"\n\n \n\n\"Well, I was just on my way to lock it. If you wanted anything, you should have come sooner\" Nate replied, trying not to show his irritation.\n\n \n\n\"Well, we're here know, and we're hungry, so how about you hop back behind that counter and flip some burgers\" Mike said, with a grin on his face. Even at the distance, Nate could smell the scent of alcohol coming from the group.\n\n \n\nJust then, the manager came out of his office. Nate was sure he was going to throw them out, but when he saw the group, he ordered Nate to get back behind the counter and serve them.\n\n \n\n\"But I need to go home!\" Nate cried out indignantly. \"I have homework, and studying, and I'm only scheduled to 10 as it is!\"\n\n \n\n\"Well, I don't care. We have customers, and you have a job to do, Nate. That is, if you want a job.\"\n\n \n\nNate couldn't believe the unfairness of the situation. After all, a few of the guys in the crowd were the same as the ones who didn't show up for work, and yet he was the one whose job was being threatened. However, he couldn't afford to lose his job, so he returned to the counter.\n\n \n\n\"Welcome to Wendy's, can I take your order please\"\n\n \n\n * * *\n\n \n\nIt was almost half past eleven before the crowd had finally left the restaurant. Nate barely wiped down each table, didn't bother sweeping at all, and took off for home. He was pissed off. He wouldn't get the time to study, after all, and could only hope to bullshit his way through enough of the test to maintain his A average.\n\n \n\nHe was peddling down the sidewalk, trying to rush home as quick as possible. Down the road, a single pair of headlights was growing larger. Even at a couple blocks away, he could hear the loud music, and the cheering voices that let him know it was more of his asshole classmates, still out celebrating. They obviously didn't care about homework, or studying. Whatever, that was their problem. They would grow up to be good for nothing losers, looking for any scraps, like most of the lowlifes who lived here. He tried to put them out of his mind.\n\n \n\nAs he continued down the street, the headlights before him getting brighter and brighter, he noticed they were swerving slightly across both lanes of the road. Now they were even driving drunk, on top of everything. Nate seriously hopes they would get pulled over. That would serve them right. If he had owned a cell phone, he would have called the police right then, and made sure these idiots got what was coming for them.\n\n \n\nHe was so preoccupied by picturing them getting in trouble, he never thought to pay attention to the vehicle. When the vehicle was just a few feet from him, it swerved, hit the curb, and bounced right up onto the sidewalk. Nate had no time to react. He saw the bright headlights rushing straight for him. He could hear the squealing of the tires as someone inside the vehicle tried to stop, but reacted far too late. All he could see was those bright headlights, rushing up to meet him. As the vehicle rushed towards him, his entire body went stiff, rigid, clenched up solid as metal. The last thing he sensed was a loud metallic clang, and those bright lights, before everything went dark.\n\n \n\n* * *\n",

    "passage": "[]\n\nTrion has announced the 5th calling for RIFT known as the PRIMALIST in a new Dev Diary video which you can check out here.\n\n\nTHE PRIMALIST\n\nThe Primalist is the 5th calling in RIFT. From the Dev Diary video, a few things have been revealed about the Primalist.\n\n[UPDATE] PRIMALIST LIVESTREAM. Trion has now also held a Primalist livestream, revealing more about the new calling including a whole bunch of tooltips and all soul trees. Check out the summary and tooltip compilation here!\n\nNEW FOCUS BAR\n\n[Primalist Focus Bar Pre-Release]\n\nThe Primalist makes use of a new focus bar that moves between Fury (bear) and Cunning (Eagle) as you use different abilities. The further you go in either direction, the more effective or powerful the abilities you use become.\n\nSIX SOULS (+4 FUTURE)\n\n[Primalist Soul Icons]\n\nPrimalist will be releasing with 6 souls at the beginning, with 4 more added in the future. It’s unknown what the 4 future souls are.\n\n-   VULCANIST: Ranged ST DPS. Fire + Earth abilities.\n-   BERSERKER: Melee AoE DPS.\n-   TYPHOON: Ranged AoE DPS. Water + Air abilities.\n-   TITAN: Tank.\n-   DERVISH: Melee ST DPS.\n-   PRESERVER: Healer. Uses blossoms and seeds.\n\nEach soul has 31 points (compared to existing Callings’ 61 points) so the Primalist’s soul tree differs a bit from existing ones. This has been confirmed by Lead Systems Designer Vladd.\n\nA few interesting tidbits were garnered from the video.\n\nTYPHOON STORM VFX\n\nIt seems that Typhoon has some new vfx assets:\n\n[RIFT Primalist Typhoon Screencap]\n\nRIFT Primalist Typhoon\n\nIt’s not an ‘entirely’ new idea, but the storm vfx looks unique compared to the existing ones in-game. It’s not too surprising that the Primalist would have new vfx though.\n\nTITAN TOTEM\n\nWhat’s even more interesting is that the Titan seems to make use of some kind of pulsing stone totem:\n\n[RIFT Primalist Titan Screencap]\n\nRIFT Primalist Titan\n\nWill it act kind of like the Beacon of Despair from Cleric’s Defiler soul, generating threat on targets and perhaps making the Titan take a percentage of damage? Who knows at this point. At the very least, the pulsing AoE from the Titan’s totem seems to keep the mobs at bay, acting as a kind of ‘wall’.\n\nPRIMAL AVATARS\n\nRed Hawk mentioned in the video that you will want at least 21 points in your primary soul to obtain the “Primal Avatar” of that soul.\n\n[RIFT Primalist Calling Primal Avatars]\n\nPrimalist’s Primal Avatars\n\nEach soul has one Primal Avatar that provides a significant boost to your spec and gives you a vfx on your head of the associated creature. From the video we know that the ‘Primal Avatar: Tiger’ is for the Berserker soul.\n\nBERSERKER SOUL TREE\n\nDuring the video, Trion briefly showed the Berserker soul tree and hovered over some abilities. This is the Primalist’s Melee AoE DPS soul.\n\n[RIFT Primalist Berserker Soul Tree Preview]\n\nRIFT Primalist Berserker Soul Tree Preview\n\nThe abilities are:\n\n-   CONDENSED WRATH. While you have a single stack of Wrath, your single target damage is increased by 5/10/15? %. This bonus is decreased by 5% for each additional stack of Wrath.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   PRIMAL AVATAR: TIGER (21PT ABILITY). Channels the Primal Spirit of the Tiger. Sets Fury to max and stops focus bar movement. Reduces the cooldown of Corpsefall and Icefall to 0 and applies 3 stacks of Calculated Action and Restrained Fury. Lasts 15s. 2min CD and oGCD.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   HEART FREEZE. Interrupted and Debilitates up to 10 enemies for 5s. 30sec CD. Instant. 35m range.\n\nIt looks like each tree requires 31 points to max out.\n\nPRIMALIST ETA\n\nSo what is the Primalist release date?\n\nNo exact date, but Lead Engineer Snedhepl has confirmed it has a RIFT 3.4 release:\n\n  It’ll be out in 3.4.\n\n  [Source: Snedhepl]\n\nRemember how Live Content Designer Kerilar mentioned in a tweet that Primalist, Planetouched Wilds and the Assault on Bronze Tomb Warfront will be released at the same time?:\n\n  They all go live at the same time. Wrap your head tight, so it doesnt explode!\n\n  [Source: Kerilar]\n\nWith that and what CM Ocho mentioned about the name of the patch in a thread on the forums, it seems we now have confirmation that:\n\nTHE 5TH CALLING PRIMALIST, THE NEW ZONE PLANETOUCHED WILDS AND ASSAULT ON BRONZE TOMB WARFRONT WILL BE RELEASED IN RIFT 3.4: INTO THE WILDS!\n\nRIFT 3.4 RELEASE DATE\n\nWhen is RIFT 3.4? Senior UI Artist Gingers has mentioned Fall 2015. [r] (So between Sept 23rd to Dec 21st).\n\nPRIMALIST COST\n\nTHE WILDS PACK\n\nThe Primalist is currently available for early purchase from “The Wilds Pack” on the RIFT Store which costs $100.\n\n-   That pack includes the 6 Primalist souls as well as a special mount, portrait, warfront announcer, scaling trinket, 30-day patron, companion pet, minion card and costume + cape.\n-   Some items are available instantly whilst others (like the Primalist class) will only be available once 3.4 hits.\n\nYou can learn full details about The Wilds Pack here.\n\nPRIMALIST FOR CREDITS\n\nThe Primalist class will be available for Credits on the RIFT Store when 3.4 launches.\n\n  Similar to the Storm Souls and Dream Souls Packs, there will also be a Primalist Pack available in game for credit purchase/gifting once 3.4 is live. It will include the calling and initial 6 souls.\n\n  [Source: RIFT Game Director Archonix]\n\nPrice of the Primalist Pack is currently unknown.\n\n\nOTHER INTERESTING TIDBITS\n\nNot exactly about the Primalist, but I’ll mention a few other stuff of interest.\n\nPOSSIBLE TETH SCULPTURE\n\n[Possible Teth Stone Monument]\n\nPossible Teth Stone Monument\n\nThe statue/sculpture/monument shown at the very beginning of the trailer might actually represent Teth. It wouldn’t be a surprise if some of the inhabitants of the Planetouched Wilds were to worship Teth, who (according to artifacts on the PTS) can change forms. The numerous hands and masks might represent his various forms.\n\nPLANETOUCHED WILDS\n\n[Planetouched Wilds Teaser]\n\nPlanetouched Wilds Teaser\n\nNot much, but here’s a screenshot of the brief moment they showed off a very small portion of the Planetouched Wilds. As we’ve garnered from PTS data files and mini-map compilations, there’s a large mass of blue and red crystals in open mining tunnels scattered throughout the area.\n\nThe screenshot also shows some cloth in the top-right which is typical of some of the structures in the zone. There’s also two blimps and floating island in the distance at the top of the screenshot.\n\nOVOG CEREMONIAL ROBE\n\n[Ovog Ceremonial Robe]\n\nOvog Ceremonial Robe\n\nThe video also showed off the Ovog Ceremonial Robe wardrobe bundle that we’ll be getting at some point. It’s already on the PTS. Just search for “Ovog” in Wardrobe (with Show Uncollected checked).\n\n[Ovog Ceremonial Wardrobe and Cloak of the Great Wheel PTS]\n\nThere’s also a Primalist Cape as seen in the top-right image. Unknown how we’ll obtain this.\n\nRISEN ARAK WALLPAPER\n\n[RIFT Arisen Arak Wallpaper Screenshot]\n\nRIFT Arisen Arak ‘Wallpaper’. Click image for 1920×1200 version.\n\nAt the very end of the video is this ‘wallpaper’. The main new things you’ll notice is Arisen Arak, the Primalist in the bottom-right hand corner and a prominent female character in the foreground.\n\nClick the image above for a 1920×1200 version of the ‘wallpaper’ taken from a screenshot of the video. I’m sure Trion will have the actual high-res wallpaper on their site at some point.\n\nThe female character will most likely be of some importance to the Planetouched Wilds storyline.\n\nCOLOR SCHEME\n\nNotice the color scheme. There’s the blue-ish/green water on the left which possibly represents the Plane of Water; there’s green at the back which represents Nightmare/Lord Arak and then there’s orange to the right.\n\nWe know that there’s new Poison, Nightmare and Burning artifact types on the PTS. Could it be possible that the orange ‘water’ to the right is hinting at a Plane of Fire expansion?\n\nPure speculation of course, and I might just be crazy.\n\nARISEN ARAK\n\nAs for the green golem in the background, that should be Arisen Arak, the guy whose model has been in the data files for a few weeks now.\n\n[Arisen Arak Model]\n\nArisen Arak Model\n\nHe will most likely appear in the Tier 3 “Lord Arak Raid” raid. Unsure if the new ‘wallpaper’ with Arisen Arak means that we’re also getting the new raid in 3.4, but my guess is that with all the things being added to 3.4, they’ll probably hold off on the raid until 3.5 (slated for some time in Fall/Winter).\n\nTRION NEW LOGO\n\nIt seems Trion’s logo has changed as well:\n\n[Trion Logo Change 2015]\n\nInteresting little tidbit.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook forward to the Primalist calling, Planetouched Wilds zone and Assault on Bronze Tomb warfront in RIFT 3.4: Into the Wilds, coming some time this Fall!\n\nKeep an eye out for other Primalist information that Trion starts posting up in the coming weeks/months until 3.4 hits!\n\n[UPDATE] You can check out the Primalist Livestream Summary for further details on the Primalist calling, including compilations of tooltips for the various souls!\n",

It is named after Sultan Said Khan (Daulat Beg), who died here on his return journey after the invasion of Ladakh and Kashmir. The Chip Chap River flows just to the south of Daulat Beg Oldi from east to west. Daulat Beg Oldi also has one of the world's highest airstrips which is one of India's Advance Landing Ground (ALG), at an altitude of 5,065 meters (16,614 feet).\n\nDBO is connected by 235 km long Darbuk-Shyok-DBO Road to Leh. It is primarily for use by the Indian Military, and off limits to civilians from Shyok onwards.[1]\n\n\nLocation and physical conditions\n\nDaulat Beg Oldi lies near the easternmost point of the Karakoram Range in a cold desert region in the far north of India, just 8 km south of the Chinese border and 9 km northwest of the Aksai Chin Line of Actual Control between China and India. Other than Siachen Glacier military bases, it is India's northernmost settlement. The nearest civilian town is Murgo to the south, which has a small population of Baltis.[2]\n\nThe Indian government first announced plans in 2001 to construct a motorable road from Leh to its destination at Daulat Beg Oldi. The road was completed in 2019. The 255-km is Darbuk-Shyok-DBO Road runs at elevations between 4,000–5,000 metres (13,000–16,000 ft). The travel time is said to be six hours.[3]\n\nThe temperature plummets as low as -55 C in the winters. The weather deteriorates frequently with strong icy winds lashing much of DBO. DBO has very little if any vegetation or wildlife. Communication is possible only through INMARSAT (satellite) phones.\n\n\nHistory\n\nExpedition of Said Khan (Etymology)\n\n[Map including Daulat Beg Oldi (AMS, 1953)] [Map of the expeditions of Sven Hedin (1906-8) including Daulat Beg Oldi (labeled as Daulat Beguldi) (RGS, early 20th century)] [Map including Daulat Beg Oldi (AMS, 1966)] Daulat Beg Oldi literally means “spot where the great and rich man died”[4] in Turki.[5] There are various folklore about whom this refers to—such as the tale about this place being the location where a large caravan was destroyed,[6] or the tale about this place being the burial site of a rich man and his treasure.[7]\n\nAccording to British colonial-era surgeon Henry Walter Bellew,[8][9] Daulat Baig Oldi means “the lord of the state died here” and the lord refers to early 16th century Sultan Said Khan of the Yarkent Khanate.[10] Said Khan purportedly died at this place while returning to Yarkent from a campaign in Ladakh.[11][12][13] He is sometime mentioned with title of Ghaza for his military expeditions.[14]\n\nThe account of this military expedition was recorded by his general Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, who was the Sultan's first cousin, in the work of history _Tarikh-i-Rashidi_ (تاریخ رشیدی) (_History of Rashid_).[15]\n\nIn Autumn of 1531 (Safar 938 AH), the Sultan Said Khan left Yarkand with Haidar and a few thousand men. Upon first time crossing the Karakorum, the Sultan encountered severe altitude sickness, but he managed to recover. In the course of a few months of campaigning, they were able to devastate Nubra Valley. As winter approached, they split forces. The Sultan left for Baltistan; Haidar left for Kashmir. In Baltistan, the Sultan encountered a population of friendly Muslims, but he turned them killing and enslaving them, possibly because they were Shiites which was heretic to orthodox Yarkandi Sunnis. On the way to Kashmir, Haider defeated the Dras near Zoji La. In Kashmir, he and his troops were hosted by the king of Srinagar. In the spring, the two parties met up again in Maryul, the Sultan decided to return to Yarkand, but he instructed Haider to conquer Tibet for Islam before his departure.[16][17]\n\nOn his way back to Yarkand in Summer of 1533 (end of 939 AH), the Sultan once again suffered severe altitude sickness. This time he succumbed to his illness near Karakoram Pass. Bellew argues that the location of his death was here at Daulat Beg Oldi. The news of Sultan's death led to a bloody succession which saw the ascension of Abdurashid Khan. Abdurashid Khan recalled the forces in Tibet and exiled Haidar. By then, Haidar had some successes against the Changpa Tibetans of Baryang, but his forces suffered greatly from the altitude and elements. By the time the army returned to Yarkand, of the starting few thousands, less than a dozen were left. The exiled Haidar received the refuge from his maternal aunt in Badakhshan. He eventually joined the ranks of the Mughal Empire where he wrote the _Tarikh-i-Rashidi_.[18][19] [20]\n\nModern era\n\nThe trade route via the Karakoram Pass was used by caravans traveling between Leh and the Tarim Basin. DBO is believed to have been a stopping point for the caravans but not known to have any permanent civilian population. India and China sealed their borders after the 1962 India-China War, ending most of the cross-border trade.\n\nIn April 2013, a platoon-sized contingent of the People's Liberation Army established a campsite 30 km southeast of DBO,[21] a location in the Indian military's “DBO sector.” In reference to their own perception of the LAC's location, India initially claimed that the Chinese camp was 10 km on their side, later revising this to a 19 km claim,[22] and claimed that Chinese military helicopters had violated Indian airspace during the incident.[23] In early May, both sides withdrew their units further back.\n\n\nAdvanced Landing Ground\n\nThe Indian Army maintains helipads and a gravel airstrip here, the highest airstrip in the world. Routine sorties are carried out using An-32 aircraft to provide relief and supplies to the troops stationed nearby.[24] The base was established during the Sino-Indian conflict in 1962, with the first landing by Squadron Leader C.K.S Raje who set a record for the world's highest aircraft landing at the time. It was operated with American-supplied Fairchild Packets from 1962 to 1966, when it had to be closed down suddenly when an earthquake caused loosening of the surface soil, making the area unsuitable for fixed-wing aircraft.[25] Work was undertaken to make the airfield operational again, and was marked on 31 May 2008, when an Indian Air Force An-32 landed.[26]\n\nThe Indian Air Force first landed transports here between 1962 and 1965 and then after a gap for 43 years, the IAF started landing at DBO in 2008. In a significant demonstration of its capabilities, the Indian Air Force landed a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft in Daulat Beg Oldie on 20 August 2013, thirty kilometers from where the 2013 Daulat Beg Oldi Incident took place in April 2013. This landing could qualify as a world record for a medium-lift aircraft landing at this altitude.[27][28][29]\n\n\nIndia-China Border Meeting point\n\nDaulat Beg Oldi – Tianwendian is the highest of the five officially agreed Border Personnel Meeting points between the Indian Army and the People's Liberation Army of China for regular consultations and interactions between the two armies, which helps in defusing stand-offs.[30] The first meeting at this location was held on August 1, 2015 (PLA Day). The events included a Chinese cultural program and other ceremonies meant to improve relations. Later in the month, India hosted a delegation from the PLA on the occasion of Indian Independence Day and celebrated with traditional songs and dances from Indian culture, Gatka martial arts, and motorcycle acrobatics performed by the Indian Army Corps of Signals.[31] The first ceremonial BPM ever held on New Year's Day was here in 2016.[32]\n\nA meeting hut was constructed approximately a year after the meeting point was opened.[33]\n\n[1] [https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/nation/india-completes-vital-ladakh-road-762332#:~:text=Building%20the%20DS%2DDBO%20section,(SSN)%20by%20the%20military.&text=The%20road%20alignment%20was%20too,and%20had%20got%20washed%20away.

    "passage": "William W. Powers State Recreation Area\n\nWILLIAM W. POWERS STATE RECREATION AREA is an Illinois state park administered by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources on in the Hegewisch community area of the City of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States.[1] The area includes of water in Wolf Lake that provides about of shoreline to fishermen.[2] The park hosts about half a million visitors annually.[3] The park contains numerous species, and is one of the most important biological sites in the Chicago region.\n\n\nHistory\n\nWolf Lake in Illinois has a storied history that somehow has lost track of the origins of the name that goes back over 150 years. Part of this history includes visits by Abraham Lincoln in which Mary Todd Lincoln nearly drowned.[4] In 1947, the state acquired a parcel known as the Wolf Lake State Recreation Area. Later acquisitions were added to the property and have increased the area which was known as Wolf Lake Conservation Area. In 1965, the Illinois General Assembly named the area after William W. Powers.[5] Powers had been a Chicago alderman on the Chicago City Council and Illinois General Assembly legislator in the 1920s, and used the site for picnics to feed the needy during the Great Depression.[6]\n\nThe park also has a military history. There is a defunct Nike Ajax missile honoring the missile site that occupied the area during the Cold War years. Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veterans Day ceremonies attract veterans who place flags at markers near a former re-dedication ceremony site that featured the Moving Vietnam Wall.[7]\n\nUnlike the Lake Michigan shoreline which has been reshaped by sand and clay, Wolf Lake has been filled in large part with slag from steel mills.[8]\n\n\nWildlife\n\n[Monk parakeets can be found in the park] Wolf Lake contains largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, redear sunfish, crappie, bullhead, carp, walleye, hybrid muskie, and yellow perch.[9] There is also an occasional salmon and rainbow trout caught in the lake.[10] Salmon can access the lake via the Calumet River and its Indian Creek tributary.\n\nNative trumpeter (_Cygnus buccinator_) and tundra swans (_Cygnus columbianus_) and non-native mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) may all be found on the lake in winter.[11] Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes.[12][13][14] Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.[15]\n\nBirdwatchers enjoy the non-native monk parakeet, which is a South American parrot, that nests in the park.[16] Hunters enjoy the seasonal waterfowl.[17] The South American monk parakeets arrived at the site in 1999 and have since established two nests with seven or eight birds each. They are presumed to have migrated from the Hyde Park community area.[18]\n\nThe park contains many willow and cottonwood trees.[19]\n\nThe park also attracts city dwelling mammals such as squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, muskrats, opossums, and the occasional coyote and white-tailed deer.[20] Beaver sign indicates that there are beaver on the lake currently.[21]\n\nOn August 23, 2002, Wolf Lake was one of three neighboring regions that hosted the Calumet BioBlitz. This bioblitz convened over 150 expert scientists to identify and record as many living organisms as possible within 24 hours. The purpose was to demonstrate the resilience of the extraordinary range of organisms in nature's battle against the South Side of Chicago's collage of factories, warehouses, forest preserves, residences, and highways as well as its battle of survival against killer pest species. Unofficially, the BioBlitz counted 1,815 species.[22] The BioBlitz included teams of scientists from Eastern Illinois University, Field Museum, Forest Preserve District of Cook County, Illinois Natural History Survey, Indiana Department of Natural Resources, University of Illinois - Champaign, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Fish & Wildlife.[23]\n\nLake sturgeon, endangered in both Indiana and Illinois, as well as banded killifish, threatened in Illinois, are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology.[24] The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds: little blue heron, yellow-crowned night heron, black-crowned night heron, and yellow-headed blackbird.[25]\n\n\nConservation\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Illinois Water Survey are studying ways to halt degradation of the lake and the USDA Forest Service is helping with a study of public interests in recreation at Wolf Lake.[26] The Wolf Lake water level determines the drainage to Lake Michigan because the connecting Calumet River flows southward during elevated levels and northward during lowered levels.[27] The water in Wolf Lake was about 18 inches higher until 1998 when the Illinois Department of Natural Resources removed several beavers and their dams that had been built across Indian Creek. The subsequent drop in water depth encouraged weed growth and changed fishing conditions.[28]\n\nThe Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the City of Hammond, IN initiated the Reconnaissance Report in December 1998. It was approved in September 2000. An environmental assessment was held in 2002. The Project Cooperation Agreement commenced in 2005.[29] The Wolf Lake ecosystem degradation problem is multifaceted. It includes exotic plant species proliferation, low diversity of plant and fish species, water depth inadequacy, poor aquatic habitat, contaminant impact, and shoreline erosion. Proposed project features include new aquatic and wetland habitat plantings; shoreline restoration; creating deep holes to locally diversify the lake bottom; herbicidal and biological controls; channels clearing, and dikes and causeways construction to restore natural water levels.[30]\n\n\nUse\n\nThe park offers stoves and has shelters available by reservation for picnicking. Two of the shelters each have capacity for 50 people, and two others each have capacity for 100 people. Fishing and hunting is permitted in accordance with regulations, but camping is not allowed.[31] Ice fishing is permitted in the winter and motorboats are permitted during the summer.[32] The lake has several dikes that temper the wave height.[33] There are 25 hunting blinds to hunt waterfowl. These sites are awarded in yearly lotteries held in late July. During the season, daily drawings are held to allocate blinds of absentee blind holders.[34]\n\nThe use of the park is protected by several types of volunteers. For example, at the 14th Annual Earth Day Wolf Lake Cleanup on April 21, 2001, more than 350 volunteers, including Hammond, IN Mayor Duane Dedelow, Jr., helped clean up and remove an estimated of waste.[35] A week later, Friends of Wolf Lake and associates collected more than 3,000 discarded tires from the lake and its shoreline.[36] Semi-annual cleanups are organized by the Southeast Sportsmen's Club and the Wolf Lake Rod and Gun Club who work with the scouts, community organizations and the Hegewisch Chamber of Commerce.[37]\n\n\nGeography\n\nWolf Lake extends across the Illinois and Indiana State line between 120th and 134th streets.[38] It is an lake that has within the city of Chicago and the remainder in the city of Hammond.[39] Its maximum depth is .[40] Wetlands adjacent to the lake include the Eggers Woods Forest Preserve, Powderhorn Lake Prairie, and Hyde Lake Wetland.[41] William W. Powers State Recreation Area is on Chicago's far southeast side, off highways 94, 90, and 41. The main park entrance is at 12949 South Avenue O.[42]\n\nAt one time, the Wolf lake was connected to Lake Michigan by a creek running through Hammond on the Indiana side, but the creek has long since been blocked by development. On the Illinois side, Wolf Lake empties into Indian Creek, which feeds into the Calumet River. The Illinois and Indiana are separated by State Line Road, which is a road elsewhere along the border, but it is only represented by a rock-and-gravel dike that passes through the lake. State Line Road ends in foot bridges where water enters from the Indiana side.[43]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n",

    "passage": "A Short Story I've been working on - Please comment! [MF]\n\nNameless\n“Hey, Green Brown!” A familiar voice called to me from the other side of the door. Quickly, I wiped my teary eyes and shakily stood up from my fetal position. I peered through the peephole. “Wanna let me in?” I recognized the voice as my best friend Blue Orange’s, and the face standing on the other side of the door confirmed it. \n\nBlue Orange and I had first become friends around a year before, when I got a job at the local news station. I was new to the workforce, barely 22. I was the head writer and she was stuck being an assistant, despite having worked at the station for several years more than I had. She was the first person I met, the first person to introduce me. \n\nOh, and there’s one thing I forgot to mention. I am completely in love with her. We could never happen though, she’s hetero and I’m homo. She knows I’m homo, but she’ll never know my feelings for her.\n\nI opened the door slowly, still sniffling.\n\n“She hurt you pretty bad, huh?” I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. She caged me in her arms, shushing me. “It’ll be alright. You’ll get through this. We’ll get through this.”\n\nShe straightened, placing her hands on my shoulders. \n\n“Hey, how do you feel about a girls’ night out?” She asked. I looked at her dolefully. “Hey, it’ll be fun!” She attempted again. I kept staring. “C’mon! You can’t just stay inside and mope forever.” \n“Who says?” I responded, but I knew she had won the fight.\n\nShe skipped ahead to my bedroom, pulling me along. \n\n“Ugh, we have got to go shopping together more.” She said, picking out a way-too-big sweater with a cheesy logo beginning to fade. Blue Orange gave me a look of disgust. “Seriously, who let you get this?” I rolled my eyes, smiling slightly. \n\nShe picked out a tight red dress from my closet.  “Ooh, I like this one.” She said, wiggling her eyebrows. I let out a giggle. \n\n“Sure, go ahead. I’m too skinny for it anyway.” I shrugged.\n\n“Aww, c’mon hun, you’re gorgeous. You just need to start finishing your Rations.” She smiled.\n\nI rolled my eyes. “We all know those don’t really make you healthier.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat them.” She said, her tone almost motherly.\n\n“Fine.” I sighed.\n\nA few seconds went by as she searched through my closet for something to wear.\n\n“Heey, how about this one?” She pulled out a shimmery golden dress that poofed out at the waist. “I think it’ll look cute!” I took the dress carefully from her hands, shrugging.\n\n“Sure.” I told her. \n\n2 hours later, we were ready. Keep in mind, the whole time we were giggling and messing up each others’ makeup. \n\nBlue Orange was about to open the door when I grabbed her arm.\n\n“I’m not sure I really want to do this. We had enough fun just getting ready, can’t we just order a snack and stay in?”\n\n“C’mon.” She responded and tugged me out the door. \n\n“Okay, so we’re gonna meet Blue Black at the George Fountain and then head to the First Club. Sound good? Okay! Let’s go!” She said enthusiastically. \n\n“I thought you said this was going to be just us.” I said, disappointed for more reasons than she knew.\n\n“C’mon, he wanted to come.” She replied. “He won’t be any bother, I promise.”\n\n“Fine.” I sighed, not really fine, but not wanting to make a big deal of it.\n\nGrabbing my wrist, she tugged me out the door, almost forcefully. We went out into the hallway and rang for the lifter. Of course, being one of the youngest residents of the building, I am on the top floor. “BUSY” A sign flicked on above the elevator, responding to our ring. We would either have to wait for the lifter to climb the 25 floors to reach us, or we’d have to descend manually. Curse you, Age-Elevation system!\n\nNot to be brought down from her happiness, Blue Orange smiled at me.\n\n“Let’s just take the bumpers, okay nerd?” She smiled at me affectionately.\n\nI hated the word nerd. It reminded me of my ex-girlfriend. She used to abhor the word, because she said it was really an insult. She always talked about words and language with such a pretentious tone, like she knew everything. I hated that about her. But that was over now. Nerd was just a word, she was just a person.\n\nBlue Orange saw the flicker of pain in my eyes. She always knew how I really felt. “I’m sorry hon. I forgot-” She put her hand tenderly on my shoulder.\n\n“It’s okay.” I flashed her a small smile. Her hand on my shoulder comforted me. \n\nWe took the bumpers to the bottom floor.\n\nThe sunlight beamed down on me harshly. I blinked quickly, squinting.\n\n“Not used to the sunlight, huh nerd?” She joked, heading to a-\n\n“Wow! How did you manage to get a Wheeler?” I asked her wonderingly. She grinned.\n\n“I applied, and they said that I had enough activities and places I have to be that are far off that  I needed a more advanced vehicle than a bicycle.” I shrieked excitedly. She opened the Wheeler door for me, bowing. I giggled, climbing in. \n\n“I’m still learning to drive this thing,” she smiled at me, “so watch out!” I laughed, giddiness beginning to set in. Maybe this could be fun. Maybe I could be happy again, even after-\n\nNo. I was going to be happy. No more thoughts of her.\n\nBefore I knew it, we were at the George Fountain. As usual, there was a tour guide explaining the story of the George Fountain. \n\nGeorge founded our Community, and thus became the last George. He was also the one who founded our One-Name system, in an attempt to eliminate overpopulation. The way it works is that parents have to apply for a name before having their child. They have to have the name approved before they can conceive the child. If not, the child will be killed at birth. Somehow, though, murder wasn’t a big deal. “Cruel But Necessary” goes the slogan.\n\nBlue Orange parked the Wheeler and we got out, searching for Blue Black.\n\n“There he is!” Blue Orange shouted, waving. We headed down to where Blue Black was staring distractedly at Toy-O-Rama, a kids’ toy shop. \n\n“Hey loser.” She said affectionately. He turned his head and gave her a kiss on the cheek.\n\n“Hey love.” He told her. “You ready? Let’s have some fun!” He said, turning to me. I gave him a fake smile and we headed off to the First Club.\n\nWe paid the guard at the entrance 20 ent and headed in to the loud, pounding music and masses of people. \n\n“I’ll get us some drinks.” Blue Black told us. I was about to head off with him when Blue Orange pulled her dress down and I got sidetracked by her cleavage.\n\n“O..Ok.” I said.\n\n“C’mon, let’s dance, nerd.” Blue Orange told me, and I snapped out of my brief distraction.\n\nAnd we danced, and danced, and danced. Feet tiring but never complaining, bodies sweating, but not wanting to stop unless the beat stopped thumping. Drink after drink we consumed, until I couldn’t see straight.\n\n“Okay, we should probably get you out of here now.” Blue Orange giggled. I didn’t have enough brain power to think for myself, so I said yes.\n\nI staggered out, Blue Black and Blue Orange supporting me on either side, and they led me forward, heading towards…\n\n“Wait, this isn’t the right way home?” I slurred.\n\nAnd we were stopped. In a dark place, that I didn’t recognize.\n\n“Don’t worry, we’re just taking a pit stop. This one’s gotta go.” She made a funny face and gestured toward Blue Black. I giggled.\n\n“Hey, Perfidi, can you- Oh, shit.” Blue Black shouted, realizing his error too late. I giggled again.\n“It’s okay; not like I’m gonna steeeaaal your name.” I garbled. “Perfiidiii. That’s a funny name.” I cracked up. \n\n“I’m Ebibi.” Blue Black, well, Ebibi I guess, told me.\n\n“I’m Elise. My mom was like, a psychic, and she like, guessed that the name would be available. It was crazyyyy.” I said to them. \n\nAnd then I realized my mistake.\n\nOh no.\n\nThey were there, blocking my path. One on each side, each holding a knife. \n\n“No, no, no!” I screamed at this mysterious girl named Perfidi. “I trusted you, I trusted you.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Elise.”\n\nI sprinted, shoving Ebibi out of the way harshly. I thought I heard a thud as he hit the ground, but I couldn’t tell.\n\nAnd then I was running. Running away, my legs pushing. Faster, faster. I couldn’t afford to look back, I couldn’t slow down. I couldn’t turn around, I couldn’t see the face of my former best friend, the face of the girl I had loved. I should have known. I should have known. She was always talking about pregnancy, getting married, having a kid. I never should’ve told her my name. How did she even know it was a nice name? How could she have known? The questions plagued me, like locusts attacking my brain. But still, I kept running. A fun girls-night-out meant to distract me from my breakup had turned into the worst night of my life. \n\nI should never have trusted her. How could I have trusted her? \n\nI couldn’t stop to breathe, couldn’t stop, couldn’t stop.\n \nWaves of panic came crashing down, panicking, panicking.\n\nTears poured down my face, pouring, pouring.\n\nTears, forming little rivers down my face, rivulets cascading down, down, down.\n\nTears, turning into scars, cutting into my face, cutting into my skin, cutting into my heart.\n\nI was wounded, fragile. But I kept running.\n\nI ran and ran and ran and ran and ran, my lungs pumping, adrenaline rushing, but I could feel myself slowing, tiring.\n\nI couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t run. I was still too drunk, my feet still too clumsy. I stopped.\n\n“Fine. Go ahead. Do it.” I cried to them. “Do it.”\n\n“Ebibi-” Began Perfidi\n\n“No. I want you to do it. I want Blue Orange to do it.” I told her.\n\nShe began to extend her knife, delicately pointing it outwards from her chest.\n\n“I love you.” I said, stepping forward to kiss her. I felt the knife penetrate my chest, but I didn’t care.\n\nThe last thing I saw was her face, crying as she looked down at me.\n\n\n“I’m sorry.” She said. “I love you too, Elise.” \n\nA single tear dripped down her cheek. \n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\nA scream erupted from the Pregnancy Facility.\n\n“What do you mean the name Elise is already taken!?” Screamed a lady, her eyes wide and feverish.\n\n“I-I’m sorry ma’am, but there was a lady here just before you who took the name. She said a fortune teller told her that the name was going to-”\n\nBut the crazy lady was gone in a fury of slammed doors and people shoved out of the way.\n\n\nOutside,  sobbed, her face pressed to the dirt.\n\n“I guess I deserved this. I’m sorry, Elise.”\n",

    "passage": "Enhanced privacy ID\n\nENHANCED PRIVACY ID (EPID) is Intel Corporation's recommended algorithm for attestation of a trusted system while preserving privacy. It has been incorporated in several Intel chipsets since 2008 and Intel processors since 2011. At RSAC 2016 Intel disclosed that it has shipped over 2.4B EPID keys since 2008.[1] EPID complies with international standards ISO/IEC 20008[2] / 20009,[3] and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) TPM 2.0 for authentication.[4] Intel contributed EPID intellectual property to ISO/IEC under RAND-Z terms. Intel is recommending that EPID become the standard across the industry for use in authentication of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) and in December 2014 announced that it was licensing the technology to third-party chip makers to broadly enable its use.[5]\n\n\nEPID\n\nEPID is an enhancement of the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) algorithm.[6] DAA is a digital signature algorithm supporting anonymity. Unlike traditional digital signature algorithms, in which each entity has a unique public verification key and a unique private signature key, DAA provides a common group public verification key associated with many (typically millions) of unique private signature keys. DAA was created so that a device could prove to an external party what kind of device it is (and optionally what software is running on the device) without needing to provide device identity, i.e., to prove you are an authentic member of a group without revealing _which_ member. EPID enhances DAA by providing an additional utility of being able to revoke a private key given a signature created by that key, even if the key itself is still unknown.\n\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1999 the Pentium III added a Processor Serial Number (PSN) as a way to create identity for security of endpoints on the internet. However, privacy advocates were especially concerned and Intel chose to remove the feature in later versions.[7] Building on improving asymmetric cryptography of the time and group keys, Intel Labs researched and then standardized a way to get to the benefits of PSN while preserving privacy.\n\n\nRoles\n\nThere are three roles when using EPID: Issuer, Member and Verifier. The issuer is the entity that issues unique EPID private keys for each member of a group. The member is the entity that is trying to prove its membership in a group. The verifier is the entity who is checking an EPID signature to establish whether it was signed by an entity or device which is an authentic member of the group. Current usage by Intel has the Intel Key Generation Facility as the Issuer, an Intel-based PC with embedded EPID key as a member, and a server (possibly running in the cloud) as the verifier (on behalf of some party that wishes to know that it is communicating with some trusted component in a device).\n\n\nKey issuing options\n\nThe issuing of an EPID key can be done directly by the issuer creating an EPID key and delivering securely to the member, or blinded so that the issuer does not know the EPID private key. Having EPID keys embedded in devices before they ship is an advantage for some usages so that EPID is available inherently in the devices as they arrive in the field. Having the EPID key issued using the blinded protocol is an advantage for some usages, since there is never a question about whether the issuer knew the EPID key in the device. It is an option to have one EPID key in the device at time of shipment, and use that key to prove to another issuer that it is a valid device and then get issued a different EPID key using the blinded issuing protocol.\n\n\nUses\n\nIn recent years EPID has been used for attestation of applications in the platforms used for protected content streaming and financial transactions. It is also used for attestation in Software Guard Extensions (SGX), released by Intel in 2015. It is anticipated that EPID will become prevalent in IoT, where inherent key distribution with the processor chip, and optional privacy benefits will be especially valued.\n\nProof that a part is genuine\n\nAn example usage for EPID is to prove that a device is a genuine device. A verifier wishing to know that a part was genuine would ask the part to sign a cryptographic nonce with its EPID key. The part would sign the nonce and also provide a proof that the EPID key was not revoked. The verifier after checking the validity of the signature and proof would know that the part was genuine. With EPID, this proof is anonymous and unlinkable.\n\nContent protection\n\nEPID can be used to attest that a platform can securely stream digital rights management (DRM)-protected content because it has a minimum level of hardware security. The Intel Insider program uses EPID for platform attestation to the rights-holder.\n\nSecuring financial transactions\n\nData Protection Technology (DPT) for Transactions is a product for doing a 2-way authentication of a point of sale (POS) terminal to a backend server based on EPID keys. Using hardware roots of trust based on EPID authentication, the initial activation and provisioning of a POS terminal can securely be performed with a remote server. In general, EPID can be used as the basis to securely provision any cryptographic key material over the air or down the wire with this method.\n\nInternet of things attestation\n\nFor securing the IoT, EPID can be used to provide authentication while also preserving privacy. EPID keys placed in devices during manufacturing are ideal for provisioning other keys for other services in a device. EPID keys can be used in devices for services while not allowing users to be tracked by their IoT devices using these services. Yet if required, a known transaction can be used for when an application and user choose (or require) the transaction to be unambiguously known (e.g., a financial transaction). EPID can be used for both persistent identity and anonymity. Whereas alternative approaches exist for persistent identity, it is difficult to convert persistent identity to anonymous identity. EPID can serve both requirements and can enable anonymous identity in a mode of operation that enables persistence, as well. Thus, EPID is ideal for the broad range of anticipated IoT uses.\n\nSecurity and privacy are foundational to the IoT. Since IoT security and privacy extend beyond Intel processors to other chipmaker's processors in sensors, Intel announced on December 9, 2014 their intent to license EPID broadly to other chip manufacturers for Internet of things applications. On August 18, 2015, Intel jointly announced the licensing of EPID to Microchip and Atmel, and showed it running on a Microchip microcontroller at the Intel Developers Forum.[8]\n\nInternet of things complexity hiding\n\nInternet of things has been described as a “network of networks”[9] where internal workings of one network may not be appropriate to disclose to a peer or foreign network. For example, a use case involving redundant or spare IoT devices facilitates availability and serviceability objectives, but network operations that load balances or replaces different devices need not be reflected to peer or foreign networks that “share” a device across network contexts. The peer expects a particular type of service or data structure but likely doesn't need to know about device failover, replacement or repair. EPID can be used to share a common public key or certificate that describes and attests the group of similar devices used for redundancy and availability, but doesn't allow tracking of specific device movements. In many cases, peer networks do not want to track such movements as it would require, potentially, maintaining context involving multiple certificates and device lifecycles. Where privacy is also a consideration, the details of device maintenance, failover, load balancing and replacement cannot be inferred by tracking authentication events.\n\nInternet of things secure device onboard\n\nBecause of EPID's privacy preserving properties, it is ideal for IoT Device identity to allow a device to securely and automatically onboard itself into an IoT Service immediately at the first power on of the device. Essentially the device performs a secure boot, and then before anything else, reaches out across the internet to find the IoT Service that the new owner has chosen for managing the device. An EPID attestation is integral to this initial communication. As a consequence of the EPID attestation, a secure channel is created between the device and IoT Service. Because of the EPID attestation, the IoT Service knows it is talking to the real IoT Device. (Using the secure channel created, there is reciprocal attestation so the IoT Device knows it is talking to the IoT Service the new owner selected to manage it.) Unlike PKI, where the key is unchanging transaction to transaction, an adversary lurking on the network cannot see and correlate traffic by the key used when EPID is employed. Thus privacy of onboarding is preserved and adversaries can no longer collect data to create attack maps for later use when future IoT Device vulnerabilities are discovered. Moreover, additional keys can be securely provisioned over the air or down the wire, the latest version of software, perhaps specific to the IoT Service, can be downloaded and default logins disabled to secure the IoT Device without operator intervention.\n\nOn October 3, 2017, Intel announced Intel Secure Device Onboard,[10] a software solution to help IoT Device Manufacturers and IoT Cloud Services privately, securely and quickly onboard IoT Devices into IoT Services. The objective is to onboard “Any Device to Any IoT Platform”[11] for a “superior Onboarding experience and ecosystem enablement ROI”. The use cases and protocols from SDO have been submitted to the FIDO Alliance IoT working group.\n\n[1] “EPID for IOT Identity” Intel Corporation\n\n[2] ISO/IEC 20008: Anonymous digital signatures\n\n[3] ISO/IEC 20009: Anonymous entity authentication\n\n[4] TPM 2.0 Specification\n\n[5] “Intel's IoT Vision sees far more than chips” PC World\n\n[6] \n\n[7] “Intel Disables Chip ID Tracking” ZDNet\n\n[8] “EPID Fact Sheet” Intel\n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n",

    "passage": "[RF]\"Skin-Deep\"\n\n*First post on reddit, first post in this subreddit, first short story ever :D Enjoy.*\n\n\n**Skin-Deep**\nWhat nice shirt he wore this evening, he looked so precious and nice. He was always concerned about his looks: How would others perceive him? So he went out to get the new trends, new clothes, new shoes, all to make people like him. He was standing in his room - it was a mess: \nHis dirty clothes were piling up on his bed and he would put them on his chair when he wants to sleep. Next to his desktop there were unwashed plates from all the instant food he used to eat. Trash was lying on the floor, pizza boxes, tissues, papers from school, chips bags and cardboard from his latest online purchases. His floor was still sticky from the parties he used to have. Beers would spill as well as wine. It was undoubtedly chaotic. \nHe didn’t even considered to clean up. “There are more important things.” he thought, while wasting his time. All the time his mom would tell him: “Clean up that mess!” She has always been very concerned about him. In her eyes he should be a good and neat boy. She felt like this education failed on him. She was worried about him ever getting back on track, studying something, doing anything that can get him a job later. Right now all he did was partying, getting drunk and high and hitting up with girls. He was always living in the moment whatever comes to his mind he would do, always following the latest trends and notions. \nHe was one of the person who has a thousand friends on Facebook but yet all of his real life friendships would be superficial, as he meets his friends on parties where they would pretend to be best friends without knowing each other. Kian isn’t too much into in-depth relationships. He has no close friends to talk to about problems or feelings, although doing this would help him a lot in many cases. But there was Aaron. Aaron and Kian know each other since Elementary School and they always had contact. It wasn’t too intense but for Kian it is his longest lasting friendship so far. Now and then they would meet. Both of them enjoyed it but it never got the depth Aaron had in other friendships. \n\nKian was standing in front of the mirror. His window was open and the sun was shining in his room through the south-facing window, illuminating him. The warm breeze of an early summer evening came in through the window. Once again he changed. His trouser didn’t fit his shirt so he decided to go with the black one instead. Black with blue – “Yes now it fits” he thought to himself. He didn’t know what he was dressing up for, but he knew that he would go out tonight. He played back his favourite electronic tune. He likes electronic music – he was always up to date with the latest tracks from the scene - no need to think too much about anything with this music – just relaxing and preparing for the next party to come. Putting his clothes to the floor, he laid down on his bed; on days he used to be sleepy, as he likes to stay up late for no reason, browsing the web, texting people. \nTonight Kian and Aaron arranged to meet each other to sip a beer together, listening to music, chatting about random occurrences, raging about school and discover some new online trends - a typical evening for them. At the same time there is also a party in town at the “Miracle” - Kian’s favourite club to go out. It is huge, 3 floors, space for about 1500 people and a lot of them Kian knows. He checked Facebook to see who is heading there tonight. Kleve, Darcy, Ryan, Sam, Holly... Holly he has a crush on her for quite some time now, basically since the week they met each other at the Miracle and danced till the morning. Kian is looking forward to seeing her again; he is uncertain to go there. “Maybe she is the one.” he told himself. “Maybe this time it will last longer than one night.”. BLING. Aaron texts him:\n“Yo mate, what’s up? What time should we meet tdy? 9 @ ur crib?” He locked his phone and put it on his bedside table, next to his alarm clock, a nap was the first thing he wanted now, still being sleepy and having some time left until he has to decide where to go tonight. \nThe sun already set when he woke up and the air coming from the window got colder, making his room chilled. No new notifications on his phone but still the pending message from Aaron and the question what to do this night. He closed the window and set down at his desk. Holly. He really wanted to see her this night. “Can we postpone our meeting, Aaron?” he texted back. “No time tdy, sry… :/”. “kk” answered Aaron.\nKian went to the bathroom to refresh and then head out to Miracle. He stopped by the fridge to get some booze for the way there. When it comes to partying he wouldn’t go without booze. “It doesn’t make sense to stay sober. Why would I go there then?” he would say.\nArriving at Miracle he immediately met Ryan and Sam, two of his party friends. They shared a mix of vodka before entering and made fun about the last time they met there. In a shabby alley they smoked a joint Sam brought with him. This was the right level to enter the club. Kian was looking for Holly the whole time, but he couldn’t find her. “Maybe she’s not here yet.” he thought to himself while he was greeting everyone he met ever before either on a party or on Facebook, pretending to know them. Getting rejected was something he got used to. Not much later he found himself alone. He was drunk and had lost Sam and Ryan on the party. At the bar he ordered his next drink and spend one to some strangers, who were exploiting him. He sat down. The world was turning, the music was hammering on his head and he felt tired. Holly. She came to his mind again. That was the reason he went there. Stumbling through the club he was searching for her, hoping to pick her up and take her to his home. He stopped and scanned the dance floor closely. So many faces he recognized. Not the one he was looking for. A blonde girl turned around and there she stood, Holly, so daintily. Kian’s view was blurred but her face was so clear to him. Focussing her gave him a hard time. She was dancing. Just like the night they met for the first time. She meant so much to him. Would she even know him anymore? They became Facebook friends, but they haven’t had contact since. Kian was nervous but he wanted to talk to her, when he suddenly realises that she is dancing with another guy. This wasn’t what he expected at all. He felt something special, but now, for her, he was just a random guy. Just like he always sees his pickups, it seems he became one of these for her now. He was like fossilised. Couldn’t move nor breathe for a fraction of seconds. The bass was still hammering on him, but he didn’t care anymore. Two more shots and he would walk off. Desperately he turned to Holly again. She hasn’t noticed him at all. \nHe woke up. His head was aching. “Blackout – again” he thought, trying to remember what happened during the night. He took his phone and looked for messages from the night. Aaron texted him: “How’s your night?”. He went to Facebook to check out Holly again and went back to Aarons message. “Holly isn’t worth it probably.” he questioned himself what to do. \nHe needed someone to talk. Was Aaron the right person for that? He let him down so many times already and their relation wasn’t too strong at all. He looked around his room. The walls were blank: no postcards, no photos not even posters. Just like his blank mind. No memory of this night. Nothing to remember, no one but Aaron. If there would be someone it would be him. So he called him. \n“Yo, what up bro?” said Kian.\n- “Hey Kain, what’s up?” answered Aaron.\n“Just wanted to chat a little, I have such a bad hangover…”\n- “Oh so you’ve been out last night?” \n“Yes…”\n- “I thought you were busy…really don’t know what to think right now. See you keep partying all the time although we planned something and then you call me like nothing happened... that’s really not what I’m looking for..”\n“I don’t get why you’re so mad. I can do whatever I want to do and you said you would be ok with meeting another day.”\n- “Sure, what else could I say? You always try to be friends with everyone, that simply doesn’t work.”\n“As if, I just wanted to go partying yesterday…”\n- “Same old story..”\n“C’mon you know that’s nonsense.”\n- “Yeah keep pretending…whatever” – Aaron hang up \n\nDuut, duut, duut. Kian hang up as well and put his phone aside. Silence. The birds were tweeting from outside. His headache got stronger and felt like a jackhammer inside his head. Rolling from side to side he could finally make it out of bed to get him a painkiller. That was when he realized that he still was in his smelly party outfit.  ",

    "passage": "Gandhi Medical College\n\nGANDHI MEDICAL COLLEGE (founded 14 September 1954) is a medical college in Hyderabad, India affiliated with Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences.[1] The college was originally affiliated to NTR University of Health Sciences.\n\n\nHistory\n\nGandhi Medical College, originally named People's Medical College, was founded on 14 September 1954. It was located at Humayun nagar close to the present-day Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital. It was opened because the original medical college in the area, Osmania Medical College, was unable to keep up with the demands for physicians in the State. Dr. Syed Nizamuddin Ahmed was the first principal and the founder of the college.\n\nOfficially it was inaugurated on 25 June 1955 by the first president of India, Rajendra Prasad.\n\nBy 1956, the college was in financial trouble, and the government of Hyderabad agreed to take it over and develop it.\n\nIn 1958, the college was moved to Basheerbagh. The old building has since been demolished. In 2003, the college moved to its new premises in Musheerabad. The new facility, along with a hospital, was constructed on the area that formerly housed the Musheerabad Jail.[2][3]\n\nInitially the teaching hospital for the college was an infirmary that opened in 1851 with funds from philanthropists, and was named KEM Hospital in honor of King Edward VII. The hospital was renamed Gandhi Hospital in 1958. At that time nearly all the heads of units were British trained.\n\nFrom 1954 to 2003, a total of 6090 students were admitted to the MBBS course. The number of students admitted ranged between a minimum of 42 in 1954 to a maximum of 224 in 1968. In 1970, there were no admissions.\n\nIn the late 1950s and 1960s, the college and hospital were consolidated.\n\nIn the 1970s there was a growth in so-called “super specialties” such as cardiology, cardio-thoracic surgery, neurology and neurosurgery.\n\n\nAcademics\n\nCourses offered by the institute include:\n\n-   Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS)\n-   Bachelors in Physical Therapy (BPT)\n-   Doctor of Medicine/Master of Surgery (MD/MS)\n-   Doctor of Medicine/MCh\n-   Bachelor of Science (BSc) courses in nursing, paramedical and medical specialities\n\n200 students per year are admitted to study for MBBS degrees. There are also 88 postgraduate students admitted per year, including those in clinical, non-clinical and super specialty subjects. Students can earn one of 37 degrees in various branches of medicine. Since 2013 the number of undergraduate seats has been increased from 150 to 200.\n\nDepartments of the college include anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, forensic medicine, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and community medicine.[4] The college plays host to several academic and cultural events throughout the year, such as medical conferences, workshops and quizzes. Some of these include Gandhi Orthopaedic Education (GOE) and AEGIS.[5][6]\n\nThe final-year students of the college also publish an annual college magazine, which is a collection of articles, photographs, artwork and other content created by the professors and students of the college.[7]\n\n\nHospital departments\n\nThe GMH is a 1,200-bed facility and each year performs about 80,000 outpatient consultations, 42,000 inpatient admissions, 15,000 minor operations, and 11,000 major operations.[8]\n\nThe hospital is divided into 27 departments:\n\n-   General Medicine\n-   General Surgery\n-   Pediatrics\n-   Orthopedics\n-   Anesthesia\n-   Dermatology\n-   Leprosy\n-   Sexually Transmitted Disease\n-   Ophthalmology\n-   E.N.T. & Head and Neck Surgery\n-   Radiodiagnosis\n-   Casualty\n-   Blood Bank\n-   Cardiology\n-   Neurology\n-   Nephrology\n-   Gastroenterology\n-   Endocrinology\n-   Cardio-thoracic Surgery\n-   Neurosurgery\n-   Pediatric Surgery\n-   Plastic Surgery\n-   Urology\n-   TB Clinic\n-   Dental\n-   OB/GYN\n-   Psychiatry\n-   Hospital Administration\n\n\nPrincipals\n\n-   Dr. Syed Nizamuddin Ahmed (founder and first principal): 01/05/1954 - 01/07/1956\n-   Dr. Bankat Chandra: 02/07/1956 - 03/05/1957\n-   Dr. D.

    "passage": "[RF] Riparian: A Love Story\n\nAcross the most of earth we met\n\nMid-summer muse of no lament \n\nBack off you went across the world\n\nAfter thee my soul unfurled.\n\n\t- Leak for Helen | two months later. \n\n\nIn a seaside town called Kep, to the far eastern side of Cambodia there walked three young men. Flint was tall blond and muscular, Sam was of moderate height and slim, Leak was taller than Sam but shorter than Flint and of a light and toned build.  All three had shoulder length hair and tan skin from their days of diving and swimming at the mouth of the Kampot River. Leak was the eldest and a philosopher at heart; he peered into the world with his green eyes and gently rolled over in his mind what was presented to him. Flint and Sam were less lofty and were of natures that gave rise to enjoyable times. Together the three balanced each other and created an air of harmony not seen often between men. \n\nThey were barefoot and on the sea shore. The air was heavy with the possibility of rain and Leak was sniffing for a place to hide before the deluge so typical of this time of year came thundering. He spotted a small café in a style reminiscent of the French colonial outpost that Kep once was. It had an off yellow tin roof with faded white wooden walls open to the street. They entered the café, Bluebird it was called, and made towards a low table near the back. As they did, two girls with dark hair and delicate features arrived and made to sit. Leak asked if they minded company, as the place was full. \n\n“Of course not.” the taller one let out, her tongue throwing forward an accent dripping with sanguinity and oddly shaped vowels. \n\nThey sat down, the two girls with their backs to the wall. The three young men spread evenly, Leak and Flint to each end of the small rectangle table with Sam taking the position directly opposite the two girls.\n\n“Where are you two from?” asked Leak.\n“Austria,” the shorter one replied.\n“How is that going for you?” inquired Leak.\nThe tall one smirked and looked at the shorter one. “What kind of question is that?”\n“A reasonable one,” chimed in Sam.\n“It has done us well so far,” the taller one answered, looking at the shorter one. \n“And names?” asked Leak.\n“Do you always phrase your questions so ridiculously?” asked the shorter one,\n“I’m Elena, and her name is Helen,” said the taller one nodding her head towards the shorter one.  Helen was spreading her gaze equally over the three men; her little brown eyes searching for comfortable place to settle.\n“Do you have names?” asked Helen.\n“Flint, Sam and Leak, we are all from Australia,” replied Flint, nodding to Sam and Leak in turn. \n\nAt this the waiter arrived, a thin Cambodian teen, with bright eyes and sharp features. His dark skin was perfect in the dimly lit café. He mulled them over and informed the group that the only food available was river crab and coffee. The girls ordered coffee. The young men only coming in to escape the rain, which had just started, ordered coffee as well. Leak rolled a cigarette and stared Helen down. Flint had noticed this about Leak previously and didn’t enjoy it; he had told him before that it was too personal and made him appear intense.  Leak however was entrapped, this Helen, so aptly named was to be his muse. Flint, not seeing inside Leaks mind had no idea of his friend’s thoughts. Leak lit the cigarette as the waiter brought over the five coffees. Lightly smoking he continued staring at Helen. \n\nHelen, noticing Leaks gaze looked down at the centre of her black coffee and swilled it, losing herself in the rhythmic back and forth motions the liquid made on the edges of the porcelain cup. \n“What are you doing this evening?” Leak quietly asked Helen. Flint was watching him, interested in how his friend would chose his next line of questions. \n“We will go out for a drink, we have two other girlfriends we are here with and they leave tomorrow. What abut you Leak? What are you and these pair doing?” \n\nThe rain stopped. \n\nLeak stood and motioned to Flint and Sam to do the same. His stare had gone from Helens face and he gently said, “we’ll find you girls tonight, there aren’t many places along this beach.”\n\nWith that the boys left. Leak first, Sam second and finally Flint, who had lingered a moment to raise his hands level with his shoulders in that unconvincing apologetic way so favored by people embarrassed and not understanding their acquaintances actions. He hurried to catch up with Leak and Sam. \n“What was that man? Those girls were cool no?”\n“That’s the problem, I’m too sober to be in her presence, I was making a fool of myself staring at her. Let’s get a bottle or two and play cards until tonight.” \n“Yeah alright,” chimed in Sam. \n\nThe three young men got three bottles of local rice liquor from the old Cambodian men who lived across the small alleyway from where they were staying. It was two streets back from the beach and was high set. They had a wooden balcony that jutted out over a small laundry shop where clothes hung to dry and women and children played, cooked and worked through the day. Flint got out his deck of cards and the boys started to play poker. Leak had them dialed. Flint only ever bet big if he had a good hand and Sam would always bite when Flint did this. Leak would bet small here and bluff there, and fold whenever Flint made a big bet. It was all a non-event really, but it was fun passing the few dollars they were using back and forth for the afternoon. The conversation turned back to the Helen and Elena.\n“Helen was beautiful wasn’t she?” said Leak, probing, hoping the other two weren’t as interested in her as he was. \n“They both were,” replied Sam as he dragged on his cigarette, pulling his long hair into a low bun. \n“I hope we find them tonight, they’ll be sure to be around one of the quieter places to the east of the beach” said Leak, putting down pocket aces and winning the six dollar pot that had accumulated. \n“Bastard… I thought you were bluffing,” laughed Flint.\nLeak looked at him through his green eyes and took a sip from his cup. The old boys across the road had sorted them out well with this drop; its lubricating effects were beginning to be felt by the group. \n“I wonder if she has ever been in love,” posed Leak.\n“Probably,” said Sam \n“I don’t like that,” said Leak\n“ahh bugger it man, she’s here now, who knows her story, no point in creating demons in your brain over it.” Said Flint nonchalantly.\nLeak looked at him and wondered if he meant that. Flint had a way of knowing when Leak was into something. It had been a while since Leak had been interested in a girl. He’d been out of it since his ex had left him.\nLeak said, “I was disabled the first time that my ex slept with another person, but as time progressed I realised I wouldn’t get anywhere constantly feeling down at others pleasure.”\nSam looked at Leak and said, “You’re always chancing with somebody else’s first love anyway. Only the rare kind of love ignores that constant of the world. And bugger poker. I need to drink more, it’s getting late and I don’t want to pay for too many drinks tonight.” \nFlint reshuffled the deck and laid down the rules. Three cards were to be drawn. One each. Whoever had the lowest number had to down the cup he had just filled up in the centre of the crooked wooden table. Flint dealt the cards. Sam lost with a six of spades. They played a few more rounds, slowly succumbing to the onset of that most European of intoxicants. \n\nThe afternoon drifted into a steamy Asian night. The children were calling to their mothers for food downstairs in their high-pitched scratchy voices. The sweet smell of the subcontinent had descended on the three and their minds were racing. Flint and Sam for what the perceived to be a night of wild abandon to come and Leak with a feeling of a man on the edge of his reason. They started along the softly lit pathway to the beachfront and made to the first bar. They walked in under the low doorway and sat with the locals at the small bench that circled the bar keep. They ordered a beer and sat. Thirty minutes passed and they had not seen the girls. Sam was drunk and implored Leak and Flint to continue on their search. The second bar, the same went down - nothing. Again they left. \n\nAs they partly stumbled, partly jostled their way down the long entrance to the third establishment, Leak spotted her. Sam and Flint continued to the bar to get drinks while Leak moved through the crowd towards Helen. She was wearing a light blue dress that hung just above her knees and left her looking several years younger than her actual age. The effect was enough to make the inside of Leaks heart shudder. They were both twenty-one and had the beauty of their youth still. They were gorgeous and the world smiled onto them wherever they went. Leak liked to think this thought, because in the moment it was absolute truth. And the finite instant of actuality in which reality exists is all there ever is. Our machinations about future prospects don’t matter.  At this thought Leak spoke to her. \n“What makes you unhappy?” He asked.\n“What a sad question.” Helen said, mulling the query over on her lips.\n“It is, but I would like to know.” Leak replied his voice filled with firmness.\n“I think being alone is what makes me the most unhappy.” She finally concluded.\nThey stared at each other for a moment. Leak was probing her face for a sign of  softening; she was probing his for a sign of care. Both had been looking for the other their whole lives and were about to water the first two seeds in their life gardens. They had to tread carefully. \n“We’re here too!” Leak heard Flint cry.\nHe and Sam found the table, placing the ice bucket filled with beers in front of Leak. Helen introduced the friends that her and Elena had mentioned that afternoon.  Two tall girls called Lolly and Ciebel. Elena kissed the three boys on the cheek and grabbed a bottle. Lolly and Ciebel smiled shyly and spoke amongst themselves, both flitting Flint meek glances. \n\n“I love being near the sea,” Helen leaned towards Leak and said. “Austria is too far from it, we do have beautiful lakes though.”\n“You remind me of the water tonight, that blue dress and your gaze it hasn’t settled once, you are fluid.” replied Leak\nHelen turned her face down and smiled under her hair. She brushed her arm against Leaks, only lightly. She wanted to see if he was aware of her movements. Was he wishing she would touch him? Leak was watching her every move; he was wishing she would touch him. She had him. It is true that a goddess can make man a servant and takes no lover lightly. She is fluid and malleable, she sees to Leaks heart and morphs to his deepest desire. Leak knows this, but on he goes. Does he think himself above the goddess, equal with her or deserving of her? \n“Come with me” she sang, reaching for his hand, feeling his strong grip in her soft fingers. \nLeak went. He loved her. Oh he loved her. She was moving through the moonlight, she was dancing with it. Leak thought of the Yeats poem ‘’The Stolen Child:’ \nCome away, O human child! \nTo the waters and the wild\n With a faery, hand in hand,\n For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand. \nAnd he was crying. And she was laughing and she was pulling him further towards the sea.  And she slipped from her dress and let it fall off her shoulders and follow the small of her back past her thighs and into the damp sand. His shirt was off he was only in his ripped and faded shorts. She was naked and he was with her. They touched the water and in they went and down she pulled him. His Helen, her Leak, she couldn’t keep him down like she had in that first of stories. The water wouldn’t stay. It ran around him and off him in streams so delicate that in that instant he believed in a God, in an underlying reason to his being. \n\nAnd they were laying on the beach now. Her under his arm, with the warm wet weight gently pressed against him.  Helen moved her small frame and leaned over Leak, straddling him.  She touched his face with her hands, holding the edges of his jaw. She leant forward again, closer this time; her breath was in his ear. \n“Come home with me,” she mused.\nLeak looked at her through the fall of her hair that had come to settle in his vision. He stared past the pools that were her eyes into her collected woman. She was the triumph of the ages. Man learned to love from her. How was it that he held her now? He settled is mind and said:\n“I already am.”\n\nA soft padding sound broke their gaze. Leak turned his eyes to the left and saw Sam and Flint leading the three girls towards him and Helen. Sam handed Leak a beer as Flint lay down old driftwood and started to make a small fire. The group sat in a half formed circle and watched on as Flint gave them warmth and light. Helen was talking to Elena. Leak was watching her. As he watched, he thought how beautiful it was that he had met her to the far eastern side of Cambodia in a seaside town called Kep. \n\n",

    "passage": "[crtique] [literary fiction] short story for publication - 1700 words Part II of II\n\nOnce all of the “pre steaks” were tagged and bagged what would our kids do? What would Mongo do; chase down the local feline and canine population, just to skin them and hawk them to the local Chinese restaurants in filthy, seedy alleyways? What would Zoey do? Would she begin reenacting her own street theatre version of The Most Dangerous Game? You may laugh, but these were quarrelsome disquiets. These questions were more concerning to me than Mr. Bobby Decker, a person who may or may not exist. If we didn’t find resolutions to these queries soon we would have bloody anarchy on our hands. After all we did have mouths to feed. It was not business as usual, as they tend to say.  \nWhen Decker finally did poise us with his existence, Mongo was processing a 1200 pound steer in the kitchen. The floor was extinguished in bull plasma, and Mongo himself was swathed from cowlick to hang nail. Zoey was at the kitchen table performing her ritual spring cleaning on her rifle when I heard the first knock. Chucky and Davey were placing their boots in the closet when we all heard the second knock. Everyone in the house perked up like a pack of wild dogs, when they hear another howling pack off in the distance. Lani looked up from his Mole sauce that he had been perched over for the past 15 minutes.  \n\t“Are you expecting anyone?” I asked. \n\t“No,” he said wrinkling, his eye-brows, pausing for a moment to process what he was being asked. “Well, no, no, I’m not.” Then we all heard the third knock clear as day. That’s when everyone begins to scramble about the house, like mice when they discover that the cat is back, and he brought friends. Lani turns off the stove, and pulls Mongo off of his step ladder. He jets down the hall a bloody Mongo in his arms into the bathroom to get Mongo cleaned up. Chucky and Davey yanked the steer off the chopping block shoving it into the freezer. Davey grabs the mop to clean up the bloody floor. I bolt to the kitchen table to snatch up Zoey’s Rifle, and toss it underneath my bed. We hear the fourth knock, I make my way to the front door, just down the hallway and around the corner from my bedroom. \n\t“Now everyone be cool!” A command that was immediately greeted with looks of bewilderment, “Seriously, everyone act normal,” I reiterate.  As I scan over their confused faces, it finally sets into my cranium, just as Decker knocks for the fifth time, that my “family” didn’t see anything wrong with our little “operation”. To them it was just business as usual. \n\t“Hello,” I said as I opened the door, greeting, the Cowboy from Dallas. He was a thin haggard man with sunken cheeks, his dark eyes resting just below his salt and pepper eye brows. His bald scalp was hidden underneath his pale white Stetson cowboy hat. Although he was a thin man he was quite large, standing at 6 foot 6 with wide broad shoulders. \n\t“Good morning sir, “he greeted. \n\t“Hello,” I said once again. \n\t“Sorry to bother you, I’m Bobby Decker, I’m a private investigator, hired by a few local gentlemen, whom possess special interest in the area.” He said looking over the cornfield behind him. \n\t“What kind of interest?” I inquired as I wiped my sweaty palms dry on the back of my pants.\n\t“Cattle, they own the surrounding cattle farms.” \n\t“Why would farmers need to hire a private investigator?” I asked with a laugh, as I feel a single droplet of perspiration running down the back of my neck.  \n\t“It’s funny you should ask, there seems to be an epidemic of missing cattle, which has oddly enough hit all of the local farms. Now if it was only 1 or 2 farms I’d be convinced that it was just a fluke, but all eight have been hit, and hit hard.” \n\t“Funny in deed.” \n\t“Well you can’t spell Slaughter, without laughter.” \n\t“What’s that?” \n\t“Nevermind.” \n\t“Eight?” I ask. \n\t“What’s that?” he asked, looking up from the front door step that he had been inspecting. \n\t“There are eight farms?” \n\t“Yes sir, there’s Kendall, Barnhill, Grover, Bond, Spencer, Arcangeli, Rodabaugh and the Smith Farm,” he said as he opened up his note pad. There were eight farms, not seven, how could we have missed one? We had scouted the area months in advance. We still had another farm to go through. However if we weren’t aware of the Smith farm what was happening to their cattle?\t\n“Huh, I wasn’t aware of the Smith farm, is it new?” \n \t“Nope, it’s been there for 27 years.” \n\t“Wow.” \n\t“Anyway, it seems that all of the eight farms have been hit hard by this freak occurrence if you will, but I was more curious if you have seen anything unusual or peculiar like maybe wandering cattle?” I wrinkled up by mouth to the left side of my face, and raised my eye brows. I looked to my left and then to my right, \n\t“No, I can’t say I have,” \n\t“How about wrangling?” \n\t“Excuse me?” Oh my god, he knows, he knows, I know he knows, I keep on repeating in my head. Wait did I say that or did I just think that, pull it together. \n\t“Wrangling… it’s when people steal cattle.” \n\t“Oh.” I say nervously. \n\t“So are you aware of any wrangling practices being performed in the area.”  \n\t“No, I cannot say that I am.” I say, I can feel my voice on the verge of cracking.  \n\t“Okay then,” he said closing up his note pad, “Thank you for your time sir.” As he placed his notepad in his jacket pocket, he tipped his hat and began to walk back to his white pick-up truck. I almost had the door closed when he turned around and asked, \n\t“Pardon me, but would you mind if I used your head?” \n\t“Uh – yeah—sure,” I said hesitantly, letting him in, if he was the cowboy that I have harkened him to be, he could smell the Bull blood from the road. I closed the door behind him, as I swallow the lump in my throat.  \n\t“It’s right there,” I said pointing to the bathroom door. Zoey was in the living room with her arms crossed, still pouting about having her M-16 confiscated. Mongo was in the kitchen with Lani, sitting on the counter adjacent to the range. I heard the toilet flush, Decker appeared in the hallway, awkwardly looking for the light switch on his way out. He waltzed into the living room, looked around halting at the facade of the fire place. \n\t“That’s nice,” he said pausing to look at me, “I’d love to have one, but that’s the one thing about Texas it never gets quite cold enough to really use a fireplace. But hey, a boy can dream can’t he?” \n\t“So you’re from Texas?” \n\t“Yup, born and raised,” he said as he made his way through the dining room, into the kitchen. Mongo glared at Decker from the counter top with his arms crossed. \n\t“What’ca cookin?” Decker asks looking to Lani. \n\t“Just some Mole.” \n\t“Mmmm, mole, sounds good.” He says as he takes a good look around the kitchen, twitching his nose just ever so slightly as he sniffs the air. “Go easy on the Ancho Chilies,’ he says to Lani “they can really over power the cocoa.” He pauses, “Well that’s what I’ve learned anyway, “he says throwing up his hands. \n\t“Thanks.” \n\t“Well sirs I must bid you adieu,” He said with a tip of his hat, “again thank you for your time, and your hospitality. You really do have a lovely home, especially that fireplace.” He added as he made his way back through the house to the front door. “I almost forgot,” he said stopping “here’s my card, just in case you think of anything or see anything. I can’t imagine it’s just wandering cattle, but hell it’s not like someone is hunting them, you know?” he says chuckling, “but then again weirder things have happened.” He smiled, shrugged his shoulders and left out the way he came in. He made it back to his pale white pick-up truck and he was gone. Decker wasn’t absent for more than 10 seconds before the entire house erupted. \n\t“I want my gun!” Zoey demanded. \n\t“What does he know about Mole?” Lani inquired. \n\t“I need to finish tagging and bagging!” Mongo Screamed. \n\t“Who was that?” Chuckey and Davey simultaneously asked. I didn’t answer any of them.\n“Family meeting five minutes,” I announced. \n\nThe entire family sat in a circle on the hardwood floors of the living room, our legs crossed Indian style. I explained to everyone that this was the beginning of the end. I told them that it was time that we moved on to the next town. I told them that the kitchen was getting too hot, and in the best interest of our little pack, we must move and start all over again. We must tap into a new uncharted market.  I explained that it was a long road of building new relationships with new butchers in new towns. I told them that this was okay. I told them that this was the vehicle that we have chosen to orbit in. This wasn’t the end but just a new beginning, because we would rather move than change our way of life. \nThe next day I took the last of the cuts down to Frankie. As I handed him the last package, I knew that he knew. He knew that this was the end of our era. He knew the same thing that I had known all along. We had devoured our town’s entire cattle supply. We both knew that our resources had dried up. We had known this from the beginning, but we did it anyway. As Frankie wrote that last check, we both knew that we had done this to ourselves. It wasn’t anyone’s fault, however no one was innocent.  \n\n",

    "passage": "2006–07 Hibernian F.C. season\n\nSEASON 2006–07 was a mixed season for Hibernian; their league form suffered from extended cup runs, and they eventually finished sixth. The reward for their cup form was a first trophy in 16 years, thrashing Kilmarnock 5–1 in the final to lift the CIS Cup. Hibs were knocked out of the Scottish Cup in a semi-final replay by Dunfermline.\n\nThe season was also notable for the departure of manager Tony Mowbray, the appointment of John Collins as his replacement and a players' revolt that quickly followed the CIS Cup triumph.\n\n\nPre-season\n\nThe competitive football started early in 2006–07 for Hibs due to their qualification for the Intertoto Cup. They were given a bye to the second round, where they comfortably beat their first opponents Dinaburg (Latvia) 8–0 on aggregate. Hibs were eliminated from European competition on the away goals rule by Danish team OB in the third and final Intertoto Cup round.\n\nHibs only played one friendly match in the 2006 pre-season, a 3–2 win at Easter Road against Premier League side Charlton Athletic.\n\nResults\n\n\nLeague season\n\n[John Collins is introduced as the new Hibs manager by Hibs chairman Rod Petrie at a news conference on 31 October 2006.] Hibs got off to a slow start in the new league season, taking eleven points from the first nine matches. The highlight of the early part of the league season was a 2–1 win over Rangers on 17 September, but this was then followed with two disappointing losses against Falkirk and St Mirren, both by 1–0.\n\nOn 7 September 2006, the management team of Tony Mowbray and Mark Venus signed new 12-month rolling contracts that were due to come into force in July 2007. A month later, however, Mowbray left the club to become manager of West Bromwich Albion. Venus took charge of the team for their next game, an Edinburgh derby, but followed Mowbray to West Bromwich in the following week. John Park and Mark Proctor took charge of two games on a caretaker basis,[1] before John Collins was appointed as manager, with Tommy Craig as his assistant. Mark Proctor became the reserve team coach before taking the manager's job at Livingston,[2] while John Park returned to his “behind the scenes” role before taking a similar post at Celtic.[3]\n\nBefore Collins took over as manager, Hibs had gone through a particularly inconsistent start to the league campaign. They were capable of beating Rangers and causing problems for every team in the league, but were also capable of losing to “lesser” sides, including St Mirren and Falkirk. In the period immediately after Collins took over, Hibs' league form improved somewhat, meaning that they clinched a place in the “top six” of the SPL with three games to spare.\n\nAfter that, however, Hibs didn't win another game until they beat a shadow Celtic side on the final day. During this winless run, reports emerged in the media of a dispute between Collins and many of the Hibs players.[4] The players strongly criticised the manager for constantly chopping and changing the team and formation. Reports claimed that almost all of the first team players went to chairman Rod Petrie hoping to get Collins replaced.[5] The period of unrest was apparently quelled when club captain Rob Jones made a statement on behalf of the squad apologising “to the management, supporters and board of the club for any distress or embarrassment that has been caused”.[6]\n\nResults\n\nFinal table\n\n\nScottish League Cup\n\n[The CIS Cup is paraded.\n18 March 2007] Hibs advanced to the League Cup quarter finals under Tony Mowbray due to two straightforward wins over lower division opposition (4–0 v Peterhead and 6–0 v Gretna). Following John Collins' appointment as manager, the team defeated Hearts 1–0 in the quarter-final and St Johnstone 3–1 after extra time in the semi-final at Tynecastle.\n\nOn 18 March 2007, Hibs beat Kilmarnock 5–1 at Hampden Park to win the League Cup for the third time in their history. This was the first major trophy that Hibs had won in 16 years; the previous trophy win being the 1991–92 League Cup competition.\n\nResults\n\n\nScottish Cup\n\n[Hibs faced Queen of the South in the 2007 Scottish Cup quarter-final.] Hibs started their Scottish Cup campaign with a difficult tie away to Aberdeen, where they drew 2–2. In the replay, Hibs produced one of their best performances of the season to win 4–1 despite conceding the first goal of the game.\n\nIn the next round Hibs comfortably beat Gretna, who they had already hammered in the Scottish League Cup, by 3–1. Hibs were then drawn away to Queen of the South, where they won 2–1 thanks to a free kick by David Murphy.\n\nThe semi-final with Dunfermline Athletic on 15 April was overshadowed by the player revolt which had immediately preceded it. The match was drawn 0–0 and the tie was replayed on 24 April. Hibs lost the replay 1–0 to a late _Panenka_ penalty by Jim McIntyre.\n\nResults\n\n\nTransfers\n\nBefore the season started, Tony Mowbray made some significant changes to the Hibs squad. He brought in two new central defenders (Rob Jones and Shelton Martis) to replace the departing Gary Smith and Gary Caldwell. Derek Riordan had also left the club, but Merouane Zemmama was brought in to provide more creativity.\n\nTop goalscorer Chris Killen had a prolific season for the _Hibees_, but it was cut short by an Achilles injury suffered while playing Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup. With Killen out for the rest of the season, John Collins signed Thomas Sowunmi, a 28-year-old Hungarian international striker, on a six-month contract as cover. Former Hibs striker Tam McManus, released by Falkirk in the January transfer window, was offered a trial period but did not earn a full contract and later signed for Dunfermline Atthletic.\n\nThe most high-profile transfer activity during the season involved Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown. Speculation persisted that both would be sold during the January transfer window, despite Collins' insistence otherwise. Thomson eventually departed to Rangers, for a reported fee of £2M, on the transfer window's final day. Brown was eventually sold to Celtic at the end of the season for a record transfer fee between Scottish clubs of £4.4 million.\n\nPlayers In\n\n  Player             From              Fee\n  ------------------ ----------------- ----------\n  Shelton Martis     Darlington        Free\n  Thomas Sowunmi     Ferencvaros       Free\n  Rob Jones          Grimsby Town      £100,000\n  Merouane Zemmama   Raja Casablanca   Free\n\nPlayers Out\n\n  Player           To               Fee\n  ---------------- ---------------- ----------\n  Gary Smith       Cowdenbeath      Free\n  Paul Dalglish    Houston Dynamo   Free\n  Antonio Murray   Histon           Free\n  Amadou Konte     Messiniakos      Free\n  Derek Riordan    Celtic           £150,000\n  Gary Caldwell    Celtic           Free\n\nLoans In\n\nLoans Out\n\n  Player               To\n  -------------------- -----------------------\n  Zbigniew Małkowski   Gretna\n  Kevin McDonald       Airdrie United\n  Alistair Brown       Ayr United\n  Jay Shields          Dundee\n  Stephen Glass        Dunfermline Atthletic\n  Sam Morrow           Partick Thistle\n\n\nYoung players\n\nSome younger players in the Hibs squad developed significantly during the season, particularly Abdessalam Benjelloun. 'Benji' gained a reputation as a 'supersub', scoring important goals in the Scottish Cup ties against Aberdeen and Gretna, the CIS Cup Semi Final against St Johnstone, and two goals in the CIS Cup Final victory. Steven Fletcher also scored two goals in the CIS Cup Final and one goal in the CIS Cup Semi Final.\n\nSeveral youngsters were given their first opportunities in the Hibs first team by John Collins. These included 20-year-old goalkeeper Andrew McNeil, 19-year-old right back Kevin McCann and 18-year-old left back / midfielder Lewis Stevenson. Midfielder Sean Lynch made his debut aged 20 against Gretna and then followed that up by keeping his place in the starting line up against Celtic at Parkhead.[7]\n\nRoss Campbell, Dermot McCaffrey, Ross Chisholm and Damon Gray (who scored on his league debut at Pittodrie) also featured. Some of these opportunities were because Collins has had to balance a relatively small squad with a heavy workload due to the two extended cup runs, but most of the young players performed creditably.\n\n\nPlayer stats\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Hibs used 32 different players in competitive games. The table below shows the number of appearances and goals scored by each player.[8] |}\n\n[1] Park wants to stay at Hibernian, BBC Sport, 23 October 2006.\n\n[2] Proctor takes over at Livingston, BBC Sport, 22 May 2007.\n\n[3] Hibs lose youth chief to Celtic, BBC Sport, 23 January 2007.\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n",

    "passage": "Plains rat\n\nThe PLAINS RAT _(Pseudomys australis)_, also known as the PLAINS MOUSE, is a conilurine rodent native to arid and semi-arid Australia.[1] Referred to as the _pallyoora_ or _yarlie_ by Indigenous groups, the plains rat was once widely distributed across central Australia, including north-west New South Wales and south-west Queensland; however, habitat degradation due to grazing, introduced predators and drought have contributed to its decline.[2] Consequently, the plains rat has been listed as 'presumed extinct' in New South Wales and Victoria, 'endangered' in the Northern Territory and Queensland and 'vulnerable' in Western Australia and South Australia.[3] While recent research has indicated the presence of the plains rat in areas such as the Fowlers Gap and Strzelecki Desert regions of New South Wales[4] and within the Diamantina National Park in Queensland,[5] there are only five sub-populations currently recognised nationally, none of which coincide with recent discoveries of the plains rat.[6] As the current population trend of the plains rat has been listed as 'declining' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the IUCN conservation status for the species is 'vulnerable'.[7]\n\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe name _Pseudomys_ comes from the combined form of the Greek word _pseudes_ (meaning “false”) and the Latin word _mys_ (meaning “mouse”), presumably because of the plains rat's puzzling similarities and differences to “true mice” in the genus _mus_.[8] The name _australis_ comes from the Latin word _australis_ (meaning “south land”).[9] Thus, the name _Pseudomys australis_, first described by Grey in 1832,[10] means 'false mouse from the southern land'.[11] [FIGURE 1 The phylogeny of rodents of the Subfamily Murinae.] The taxonomy of Australian rodents remains controversial; however, it is commonly accepted that there are two major groups including the Australo-Papuan Old Endemics and the Australo-Papuan New Endemics[12] (FIGURE 1). The plains rat is considered an Australo-Papuan Old Endemic as DNA sequencing from fossilised evidence suggests that its ancestors first arrived in Australia between 4.2 and 5 million years ago, during the Pilocene era.[13] Old endemics, particularly the Family Muridae, are believed to have originated in Southern Asia[14] and then diversified through multiple rodent lineages.[15] Relationships between Australian members of the Order Rodentia suggest that a New Guinean lineage gave rise to the Australo-Papuan Old Endemics and thus the early ancestors of the plains rat.[16]\n\nThe plains rat is an Australian conilurine rodent of the Order Rodentia.[17] Within the Order Rodentia are two suborders: the Hystricognathi and the Sciurognathi.[18] The Suborder Sciurognathi comprises several groups; however, the largest group, the Family Muridae, is inclusive of the Subfamily Murinae and Genus _Pseudomys,_ of which the plains rat is classified.[19] Australian native rodents are composed of 13 genera, reflective of the habitats in which they occur.[20] _Pseudomys_ occupy the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia; however, fossil records suggest that the plains rat has occupied far more diverse habitats in the past,[21] contributing to difficulties in determining the differences between populations of the same species and different species within the Genus _Pseudomys_.[22] Thus, the species _P. australis_ now includes all specimens previously classified as _P. rowlinnae_, _P. minnie_ and _P. auritus_.[23]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\n[FIGURE 2 The five primary extant populations of the plains rat as recognised by the 2012 National Recovery Plan.] The primary extant population of the plains rat can be divided into five broad geographic zones: 1) the Arcoona Tableland, SA; 2) the Southern Lake Eyre region, SA; 3) the Moon Plain region, SA; 4) the Oodnadatta region (including Witjira National Park), SA/NT; and, 5) the Andado Station and Mac Clark Conservation Reserve, NT[24] (FIGURE 2). These areas are characterised by access to boulders, small stones and gilgais (depressions and water soaks)[25] and are consistent with the plain rat's primary habitat type of stone-covered plains.[26]\n\nHistorically, the plains rat was widely distributed across a broad range of habitats including river flats, grasslands, sand ridges and lowland shrubs;[27] however, the current assumed distribution of the plains rat is limited to the gibber (stone-covered) plains (FIGURE 3) in central-northern South-Australia.[28] These areas are characterised by cracking clay, productive depressions and minor drainage lines which support low open scrublands and ephemeral grass or herb lands.[29] While an individual's home range is roughly 1.6 hectares, colonies may extend beyond their preferred habitat type in search of drought refuges, essentially increasing their home range.[30] These refuges are usually areas of higher shelter and food availability with more productive vegetation types.[31] Similarly, during times of high rainfall, populations displaced due to flood inundation may migrate temporaily into surrounding habitat types.[32] [FIGURE 3 Gibber country in Diamantina National Park, QLD, Australia. Photography by David Elliott (24/07/2015).]\n\n\nPhysical description\n\n[FIGURE 4 Plains rat at Mac Clark (Acacia peuce) Conservation Reserve, NT, Australia. Photography by Tim Bawden (18/09/2017).]The plains rat has a stocky build of around 65 grams with long ears and a rounded muzzle and is grey to brown along its back with white or cream lining its underbelly[33] (FIGURE 4). Its combined head and body length is usually between 90 and 145 millimetres and its tail is roughly as long as its body.[34] During lactation, females can be observed dragging their young as they each latch to one of the four teats located on its underbelly.[35]\n\n\nBehaviour and ecology\n\nThe plains rat constructs a complex system of shallow connected tunnels beneath the cracking clay of gibber plains, emerging only at night to feed on seeds, stems and arthropods.[36] The home range of an adult is roughly 1.6 hectares.[37] During non-breeding periods both sexes live together in colonies of up to 20 individuals; however, during breeding periods one male occupies a burrow with up to three females.[38] During breeding cycles males becoming increasingly agitated and both sexes are known to stand on their hind feet and squeal loudly when threatened.[39] Whilst breeding is not regularly seasonal, young is generally produced after sexual maturity is reached at 8–10 weeks and after a gestation period of 30–31 days.[40] Litter sizes usually consist of four young but up to seven young can be produced in one litter.[41]\n\nThe lifespan of the plains rat is generally two years; however, their survival often depends on resource availability.[42] Thus, during years of consecutively high rainfall, their lifespan can approach 4.5 years.[43][44] Similarly, during severe drought most will only survive one year.[45] [FIGURE 5 European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a common predator of the plains rat. Lake Cargelligo, NSW, Australia. Photography by Harley Kingston (03/01/2012). |left]\n\n\nThreats\n\nHabitat degradation, introduced predators and drought collectively threaten the survival of the plains rat.[46] Habitat degradation mainly derives from introduced hoofed stock and land clearing.[47] Hoofed stock lessen vegetation cover, crush the seed bank and trample burrows while land clearing removes food sources vital to the survival of the plains rat.[48] Reduced vegetation cover and damaged burrows only makes it easier for introduced predators such as the European fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) (FIGURE 5) and feral cat (_Felis catus_) to excavate shallow burrows.[49] This can contribute to local extinctions, particularly when populations are already low during periods of drought.[50][51] Other potential threats to the plains rat include altered fire regimes, leading to increased intensity of bushfires; competition with the introduced house mouse (_Mus musculus_) and European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_); and, climate change.[52][53] [FIGURE 6 Plains rat near Mount Dare Station, SA, Australia. Photography by Tim Bawden (07/09/2017).]\n\n\nConservation\n\nThe _Action Plan for Australian Mammals 2012_[54] identifies three main conservation objectives for the plains rat. These objectives include: 1) managing threats in order to secure or increase the plain rat's overall population size; 2) maintaining viable sub-populations where the plains rat is known to occur; and, 3) identifying and protecting drought refugia.[55] The _2012 National Recovery Plan for the Plains Mouse_[56] encourages collaboration between communities, governments and industries to meet these conservation objectives in order to conserve the plains rat (FIGURE 6).\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] Moseby, K.

    "passage": "Bomberman (1990 video game)\n\nis a action-maze video game originally developed and published by Hudson Soft for the TurboGrafx-16 in Japan on 7 December, 1990 and later in North America by NEC in 1991. Belonging to the _Bomberman_ franchise, it is a greatly expanded re-imagining of the first game in the series starring White Bomberman on a quest to rescue Lisa, the kidnapped daughter of his inventor Dr. Mitsumori, from the castle of Black Bomberman while defeating evil monsters and villains that work for him. Initially released for the TurboGrafx-16, the game was later ported to home computers, each one featuring changes compared to the original version. Conversions for other platforms were in development but never released. The title garnered positive reception from critics since its initial release on TurboGrafx-16 and later on home computers.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nSingle-player\n\nThe single player game is divided into eight worlds, each one divided into eight stages.[1][2] Each stage is presented as a maze of blocks filled with enemies. By using bombs, the player must destroy the blocks blocking their path and defeat all of the enemies. Once all of the enemies are defeated and the hidden exit is uncovered, the player can proceed to the next stage. Each stage also includes one power-up hidden under one of the blocks, which can increase the number of bombs drops, increase the range of the bombs' explosions, and other useful powers. The eighth stage in each world is a boss battle.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe game also includes a multi-player mode which allows up to five players to compete against one another (requires the use of a TurboGrafx-16 Multitap). This mode plays identically to the single-player mode, with the exception of power-ups being limited to only Bombs and Fire. There is also an alternate multi-player mode, Skull Mode, in which skulls sometimes appear hidden beneath blocks, which are detrimental if picked up.\n\n\nDevelopment and release\n\n_Bomberman_ on the TurboGrafx-16 was created by most of the same team that would work on several projects such as later entries in the _Bomberman_ series at Hudson Soft, with Tsukasa Kuwahara acting as sole designer.[3] Atsuo Nagata and Yūji Muroya served as co-programmers, while Hideyuki Ogura and Mika Sasaki created the pixel art.[4] The soundtrack was composed by Jun Chikuma, with Keita Hoshi also collaborating in its development at sound programmer.[5] The game was first published in Japan by Hudson Soft on 7 December 1990 and later in North America by NEC in 1991.[6] In Europe, the title was released for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS by Ubi Soft as _Dyna Blaster_ due to the European mainstream media associating the original name with terrorist bombings.[7][8][9] Versions for Atari Lynx and Commodore 64 version were in development but never released.[10][11][12] This game was also released as a pack-in title for the Super CD-ROM² add-on alongside Gate of Thunder, Bonk's Adventure, and Bonk's Revenge. However, this version of the game is hidden; to access it, press Up, Right, Down, Left, and II on the TurboGrafx-16 controller. A sound will play and you will be taken to the Bomberman game. The TurboGrafx-16 version of the game was also re-released for PCs in 2002 alongside Bomberman '93 and Bomberman World as part of a compilation disc titled _Bomberman Collection_.\n\n\nReception\n\n  Reception\n  ------------------- -------------- ------ ------------ --------- ------------\n  Review scores\n  Publication\n  TG-16\n  _ASM_\n  _Amiga Action_\n  _Amiga Computing_\n  _Amiga Format_\n  _Amiga Mania_\n  _Amiga Power_\n  _CU Amiga_\n  _CVG_\n  _Famitsu_\n  _Hobby Consolas_\n  _Joystick_\n  _TOfAG_\n  _PC Engine Fan_\n  _PC Games_\n  _Raze_\n  _ST Action_\n  _ST Format_\n  _ST Review_\n  _Tilt_\n  _Top Secret_\n  _VG&CE_\n  _Zero_\n\nTurboGrafx-16\n\n_Bomberman_ on the TurboGrafx-16 garnered positive reception from critics since its release.[59][60] _Aktueller Software Markt_{{'}}s Hans-Joachim Amann criticized the visuals but commended the sound and gameplay.[61] _Computer and Video Games_{{'}}s Paul Glancey and Richard Leadbetter praised the visuals, music, gameplay and multiplayer.[62] French magazine _Génération 4_ praised the animations and playability but criticized the visuals and sound.[63] _Hobby Consolas_{{'}} Marcos García commended the simple graphics, sound, gameplay and multiplayer aspect.[64] Likewise, Jean-Marc Demoly of French publication _Joystick_ praised the gameplay and multiplayer component.[65] Both Martin Weidner and Stefan Hellert of German magazine _Mega Fun_ gave the TurboGrafx-16 original a positive outlook.[66] Japanese readers of the magazine _PC Engine Fan_ voted to give the game a 23.78 out of 10 score, ranking at the number 51 spot.[67]\n\nDieter Kneffel of German magazine _Play Time_ felt mixed in regards to the visuals and sound but praised the gameplay.[68] Likewise, Olivier Scamps of French magazine _Player One_ felt mixed about the graphics and sound but commended the gameplay and the ability to play against other players simultaneously.[69] Heinrich Lenhardt of German publication _Power Play_ was more critical of the visuals and sound, however he commended both gameplay and multiplayer positively.[70] _Raze_ noted that “_Bomber Man_ is good in one player mode, but really come into its own with two or more players”, stating that the magazine's staff played the multiplayer mode daily.[71] _Tilt_{{'}}s Alain Huyghues-Lacour, however, gave the TurboGrafx-16 original a mixed overall outlook.[72] Michael Hengst of German outlet _Video Games_ was more critical to the game in regards to several aspects but gave it a positive outlook regardless.[73] _VideoGames & Computer Entertainment_{{'}}s Joshua Mandel commended the cartoony graphics and sound effects but criticized the single-player's short length.[74] _Bomberman_ on the TurboGrafx-16 was included in the 2010 book _1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die_.[75]\n\nAmiga\n\nThe Amiga conversion of _Bomberman_ received critical acclaim from reviewers.[76][77][78][79][80] _Amiga Action_{{'}}s Jason Simmons praised the graphics, sound and combination of puzzle and arcade elements, stating that “the simplest games are often the best and this is definitively the case with _Dyna Blaster_.”[81] _Amiga Computing_{{'}}s Daniel Whitehead praised the colorful graphics, sound design, gameplay and multiplayer, though Whitehead noted that “single players may feel a bit neglected, though.”[82] _Amiga Format_{{'}}s Linda Barker commended the simple but colorful graphics, addictive gameplay and multiplayer, however Barker criticized the sound design.[83] _Amiga Mania_{{'}}s Ashley Cotter-Cairns praised the fast gameplay, sound and graphics but criticized the longevity of the game, stating that “_Dynablaster_ won't hold your attention for very long.

    "passage": "“The Patriot” is a decent revenge narrative about a by the numbers good guy who was pushed too far. But for celebrating the Fourth of July, it’s trash. The Fourth of July shouldn’t be about celebrating warfare or revolution, it should be about celebrating exceptional American freedom.\n\nThe British statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke never called what happened here in 1776 a revolution. His most appropriate designator was “civil war.” He was highly critical of the French revolution, as we all should be, as it was a terrifying failure.\n\nWhat was different about America? Why are we the unicorn of political revolutions? It’s because we didn’t revolt and overthrow a government. We defended our English rights against English tyranny. We were self-governing and had outgrown rule from that little Island.\n\nThe author Os Guinness uses this classic example of Captain Levi Preston to demonstrate the point:\n\n“Captain Preston, what made you go to the Concord fight?”\n\n“What did I go for?”\n\n“Were you oppressed by the Stamp Act?”\n\n“I never saw any stamps, and I always understood that none were sold.”\n\n“Well, what about the tea tax?”\n\n“Tea tax? I never drank a drop of the stuff. The boys threw it all overboard.”\n\n“I suppose you had been reading Harrington, Sidney, and Locke about the eternal principle of liberty?”\n\n“I never heard of these men. The only books we had were the Bible, the catechism, the Psalms, Isaac Watts’ hymns, and the almanacs.”\n\n“Well, then, why did you go out to fight?”\n\n“Young man, what we meant in going for those Redcoats was this: we always had been free, and we meant to be free always.”\n\nThe American Revolution was self-defense. We were free, and our English brothers were getting in the way. So rather than celebrating something that stirs up violent revolutionary sentiments that would make Jean Jacques Rousseau weep with envy, I propose these films as replacements for “The Patriot” during your July Fourth celebrating.\n\nWhen you truly love something, you take it as it is, warts and all. Not every film on this list is happy. But all these films are America.\n\n\n1. ‘12 Angry Men’\n\nThis film is proof-positive that ultimately great films are built on great scripts. More than that, this movie is about how American jurisprudence rests on “innocent before proven guilty.” English jurisprudence was built on “guilty before proven innocent.”\n\nInnocence of a crime one didn’t commit is extremely hard to prove. Often, it’s impossible. There are too many people in our prisons, too many needlessly deprived of freedom. This film reminds us that isn’t ultimately the fault of a “system” but often the fault of 12 people.\n\nJury duty is an important part of our freedom. Let’s be better at it.\n\n\n2. ‘American History X’\n\nThis film is brutal and not for everyone. It’s a tragic tale of a brilliant young man who turns to white supremacy to heal the wounds of losing his father. Sound relevant?\n\nAmerica is one of the least racist places in the world. I’m not trying to Howard Zinn this list. But “American History X” is about how America is an antidote to racism. The tag line—“some legacies must end”—says it all. America was built on principles in conflict with slavery.\n\nEvery society on Earth has been built upon slavery. But America said our pillars will reject that. We haven’t been consistent, we have failed. But we have the keys to freedom from racism and, like Martin Luther King Jr., we must grasp tighter to those keys, not looser.\n\nWe must become more fundamentalist about American exceptionalism in this regard, more convinced, more impassioned. We must set free the better angels of our nature and stop trying to solve our racial problems from without but look within. Constraints don’t make people good. Racism is ultimately a struggle of the soul, and our founding principles defeat hate every single day, whether we see it or not.\n\n\n3. ‘Barbershop’\n\nThis film is pure Alexis de Tocqueville. The meditating communal institutions of America are what fundamentally facilitate freedom. It’s the governments’ job to remove constraints so that can happen.\n\nIn Greenville, North Carolina, there’s a program called “Cops and Barbers” for at-risk youth. It’s a network of men who are watching out for the kids of that community. American freedom resides in the people, but it’s unsustainable without community. This film celebrates that like none other.\n\n\n4. ‘Brooklyn’\n\nThis wonderful film has really gone under the radar and should be essential viewing for the Fourth of July. Saorise Ronan beautifully portrays an Irish immigrant who is trying to make a life in Brooklyn. We are a nation of immigrants, and I wish the entire world could live here. I would have no problem with completely open borders if we abolished the welfare state and federal income tax.\n\nBut that won’t happen anytime soon, if ever. Conservatives want people to come here because we believe America is exceptional! We want people who want to be free to be able to be free. Here your heart can sing unhindered. This beautiful clip from the film really says it all:\n\n\n5. ‘Field of Dreams’\n\nDo I even need to defend this one? Baseball. Iowa. Anti-censorship. Unwavering faith. Corn fields. Conflicted relationships with fathers. James Earl Jones. Kevin Costner before “Waterworld.” It doesn’t get any more American than this! I don’t know why you aren’t watching this movie right now. This film is a celebration of everything we are as a nation.\n\n\n6. ‘Friday’\n\nThis film is hilarious, but it’s also about fundamental American values. If marijuana and profanity makes you uncomfortable, you may want to skip this one (I’m not a fan but I still love this movie). But ultimately this film is about bullies and standing up to them. It’s about being a man and growing up. It’s about how communities are only as good as their people.\n\nWe decide what kind of communities we’ll have. We decide how free we are.\n\n\n7. ‘The Iron Giant’\n\nThis is quite possibly the greatest animated film ever made. Like Brad Bird’s excellent Incredibles films, it’s jam-packed with American nostalgia. It has numerous virtues such as suspicion of power and the simple joys of being a young child running around in the woods.\n\nBut its message about appearances being deceptive is probably the most important. America is against pre-judgement. Prejudice kills the soul. “Look, it’s none of my business, but who cares what these creeps think of you? They don’t make you what you are, you do. You are who you choose to be.”\n\nIf you’ve never seen this film, you owe it to yourself to watch it this Fourth of July. If you don’t shed a tear at the end, well, then you’re the one made of iron.\n\n\n8. ‘The Karate Kid’\n\nI said everything I needed to say about this film here. In this article I’ll simply say if the Fourth is about patriotism, then it’s ultimately about fatherhood. “They carried in their souls the spirit of their fathers. The root of the word ‘patriot’ comes from the Greek word _patris_. _Patris_ means father.”\n\n\n9. ‘The Last Unicorn’\n\nThis wonderful animated film is perfect for celebrating the Fourth of July because America is a unicorn. A unicorn is something that shouldn’t exist, something precious and unique. There has never been a country like this one: A country founded on principles in direct conflict with slavery. A country willing to fight a war over slavery. A country with no nationality or enforced religion. A country with no king. Even the soundtrack to this film was performed by America!\n\nMore importantly, this film is about finding things that are lost. And something is very lost in our country today. We need to go looking for it. The keys to freedom have been locked away somewhere and it’s going to require each of us to go on a soul-searching quest to find them.\n\nThe lyrics from the theme song are tremendous and oddly evoke our current predicament perfectly:\n\n  When the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing\n  And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising\n  And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn\n  In the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn\n  I’m alive, I’m alive.\n\nAmerica is the last unicorn, and she is still alive. We have to go find her and set her free again.\n\n\n10. ‘Lincoln’\n\nFundamentally, this film is about the contradictions of the American founding. Slavery existed in the land of the free for a long time. But evil can’t be stamped out with a hammer. It takes wisdom, time, patience, and hard work.\n\nThe best line in the film demonstrates this beautifully: “A compass, I learned when I was surveying, it’ll… it’ll point you true north from where you’re standing, but it’s got no advice about the swamps, deserts and chasms that you’ll encounter along the way. If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge ahead heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp… what’s the use of knowing true north?”\n\nThis film also tells a story about a functioning legislative branch. Nowadays, our representatives and senators are pundits. They’ve grown fat and lazy. Here we get to see what republican democracy is supposed to look like in all its nasty, raw beauty.\n\nWe deserve men like Thaddeus Stevens, who was willing to say things that made his heart break in order to free people. I pray for a Congress that calls each other reptiles again to break the shackles of tyranny.\n\n\n11. ‘Miracle’\n\nWhat conservatives want to conserve is not the bizarre caricature of rugged individualism and social darwinism that the Left says we represent. Jonah Goldberg put it very well: “The market system is so good at getting people—from all over the world—to work together that we barely notice how much we’re cooperating. Liberalism, meanwhile, by refusing to give people direction and meaning from above—as every ancient system did, and every modern totalitarianism does—depends on a healthy civil society to provide the sense of meaning and belonging we all crave. Civil society, as I explain later, is that vast social ecosystem—family, schools, churches, associations, sports, business, local communities, etc.—that mediates life between the state and the individual. It is a healthy civil society, not the state, that civilizes people.”\n\nThat is what this film represents. It’s Tocqueville versus Karl Marx. The USSR’s hockey team was the incarnation of Communism, and a bunch of college kids defeated it! If you don’t have time to read Goldberg’s “Suicide of the West,” then maybe just watch this film. They’re both about naturalistic miracles.\n\n\n12. ‘Remember the Titans’\n\nThis movie is pure Americana, from the soundtrack to the morals. Sports save lives, sports breed forgiveness, because sports don’t really matter. The stakes are lower with sports, so we can enter into them more lightly. That’s how we discover each other.\n\nThis is why Robert Putnam titled his book “Bowling Alone.” You can can’t discover others by playing solitaire. This country is built upon an infinite string of individual relationships. It isn’t ultimately about what happens in DC. It’s about us and how well we can learn to live with each other.\n\n\n13. ‘Steel Magnolias’\n\nNo one needs an excuse to watch this wonderful film, but the Fourth of July is a pretty good one. Our women have always made this country great. They are tough and beautiful, magnolias made of steel. “Laughter through tears is my favorite emotion.” Enough said.\n\n\n14. ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’\n\n“Now, gentlemen, in this country, our courts are the great levelers. In our courts, all men are created equal. I’m no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and of our jury system – that’s no ideal to me. That is a living, working reality! Now I am confident that you gentlemen will review, without passion, the evidence that you have heard, come to a decision and restore this man to his family. In the name of God, do your duty. In the name of God, believe Tom Robinson.”\n\nThe members of this infamous jury in this famous American book didn’t believe the falsely accused Tom Robinson. Yet freedom requires better of us. It requires that we take responsibility for ourselves and our world.\n\nThe Fourth of July means nothing if it isn’t nested in what Thomas Sowell calls “the tragic vision of the world.” This sees that the world is cracked and broken and says we must go to the broken places without idealism, but with tragic conviction that our principles are true even when we fail to live up to them.\n\n\n15.\n\nThis last one is blank. I’m several generations removed from Pacific Northwest Indians, but whenever I visit Oregon the land awakens the echoes in my soul. I pray that someday this spot could be filled by a film about Black Elk, a holy man of the Lakota.\n\nHe decided to follow Jesus, whom the Lakota call Wanikiya: “He who makes live.” He was a convert to Catholicism and is being considered for canonization by the Catholic Church. Someday he will be remembered as one of the great Americans, but unfortunately his Christianity runs against the grain of the racist identity politics of American leftism.\n\nBlack Elk was at the Wounded Knee massacre, but overcame tragedy with faith. The life blood of America has always been faith. The separation of church and state isn’t designed to protect atheists, it’s designed to protect faith from the state. Without faith there is no freedom, and therefore no America.\n\nA.C. Gleason is a proud Biola University alum, where he met his wonderful wife. He earned his MA in philosophy of religion from Talbot.

    "passage": "Summer seminar UPC TelecomBCN (July 4-8, 2016)\n\nDeep learning technologies are at the core of the current revolution in artificial intelligence for multimedia data analysis. The convergence of big annotated data and affordable GPU hardware has allowed the training of neural networks for data analysis tasks which had been addressed until now with hand-crafted features. Architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and Q-nets for reinforcement learning have shaped a brand new scenario in signal processing. This course will cover the basic principles and applications of deep learning to computer vision problems, such as image classification, object detection or text captioning.\n\n\nCourse Instructors\n\n  [Xavier Giro-i-Nieto]      [Elisa Sayrol]      [AmaiaSalvador]       [Jordi Torres]      [Eva Mohedano]      [Kevin McGuinness]\n  -------------------------- ------------------- --------------------- ------------------- ------------------- -----------------------\n  Xavier Giro-i-Nieto (XG)   Elisa Sayrol (ES)   Amaia Salvador (AS)   Jordi Torres (JT)   Eva Mohedano (EM)   Kevin McGuinness (KM)\n\n\nTeaching assistants\n\n  [Junting Pan]   [Míriam Bellver]   [AlbertJimenez]   [Andrea Ferri]   [Alberto Montes]   [Maurici Yagües]\n  --------------- ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- ------------------ ------------------\n  Junting Pan     Míriam Bellver     Albert Jiménez    Andrea Ferri     Alberto Montes     Maurici Yagües\n\n\nOrganizers\n\n  [logo-etsetb]           [logo-gpi]                   [logo-upc]                                   [logo-bsc]                        [logo-insight]                      [logo-dcu]\n  ----------------------- ---------------------------- -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------------------\n  UPC ETSETB TelecomBCN   UPC Image Processing Group   Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)   Barcelona Supercomputing Center   Insight Centre for Data Analytics   Dublin City University (DCU)\n\n\nLecture Slides and Videos\n\n  Topic                        Speaker   Slideshare   YouTube\n  ---------------------------- --------- ------------ ---------\n  D1L1 Welcome                 XG        Slides        \n  D1L2 Classification          EM        Slides        \n  D1L3 Deep networks           ES        Slides        \n  D1L4 Backward Propagation    ES        Slides       Video\n  D1L5 Training                EM        Slides        \n  D1L6 Software Frameworks     KM        Slides       Video\n  D2L1 Memory & Computation    KM        Slides       Video\n  D2L2 Data Augmentation       EM        Slides        \n  D2L3 Visualization           AS        Slides       Video\n  D2L4 Imagenet Challenge      XG        Slides        \n  D2L5 Transfer & Adaptation   KM        Slides       Video\n  D2L6 Recurrent Networks      XG        Slides       Video\n  D3L1 Unsupervised Learning   KM        Slides       Video\n  D3L2 Saliency Prediction     ES        Slides        \n  D3L3 Optimization            KM        Slides        \n  D3L4 Object Detection        AS        Slides       Video\n  D3L5 Face Recognition        ES        Slides       Video\n  D3L6 Image retrieval         EM        Slides       Video\n  D4L1 Generative Models       KM        Slides        \n  D4L2 Segmentation            AS        Slides       Video\n  D4L3 Language and Vision     XG        Slides       Video\n  D4L4 Video Analytics         XG        Slides       Video\n  D4L5 Medical Imaging         ES        Slides       Video\n  D4L6 Attention Models        AS        Slides       Video\n  D5L Closing                  XG        Slides        \n\n\nHands on TensorFlow\n\nThe seminar includes five practical sessions on TensorFlow, the Open Source Software Library for Machine Intelligence developed by Google.

The world's best lubes. \n\n\nInterested in watching all of our Brass Chats Teasers?  They're right here:\n\n May 10, 2020/ Joel Baroody\nThe world-famous Canadian Brasscame to play in Hartford, Connecticut this past winter, and the Monster boys were fortunate enough to snag some tickets. Obviously, seeing the Canadian Brass is a bucket-list concert item—and if you haven’t checked that box, when all of the sheltering-in-place is behind us, do it!!—but even COOLER was the fact that Charles Daellenbach (tuba player/performer extraordinaire and founding member of The Canadian Brass) sat down with us after the show for a beer and a chat!\n\nThe gracious Mr. Daellenbach was generous with his time and shared so much. You’ll hear great stories, all the way from Arnold Jacobs to tales from the road (like headlining a….hang on…..Country and Western Festival?!).\n\nAs with each of the Brass Chats, there’s plenty here that stays with you after the interview, and lots of ideas that you can start to implement the minute you finish watching. Charles tells us about why many freelancers fail to find work, how ideas are everywhere all the time for the taking, how to put on a show without selling out, and much more.\n\nWe hope you enjoy! Love,\n\nTom, Chris, and Joel—Monsters.\n\n February 24, 2020 February 24, 2020/ Joel Baroody\nIf your supplemental musical web surfing has not brought you into the path of this month’s Brass Chatter, you’re probably living in a house made of rocks and need to go out back to see if the pterodactyl holding your internet connection in place is still alive. Test it by poking him with a stick, and once he (this is a Flintstones joke kids, stick with us for a sec) looks at the fourth wall and says “hey….it’s a livin!” ….you’ll know the problem is fixed. Now that your connection is fixed and you’ve gone back inside under your rock roof and sat down in your rock chair, we have two jobs for you:\n\nJob One: watch this Brass Chat! Michael is a dude who….just knows. You name it and he’s played it, and you’ll hear about a bunch of it here, from playing with the Rolling Stones to Buddy Rich to Broadway. You’ll also get to learn how he built his business from the ground up, what his most moving performance was, his thoughts on learning how to improvise, and the most important element to his success. Speaking of that…..\n\nJob Two: start exploring the boundless universe of amazing things that our friend MICHAEL DAVIS! has created! Your jumping-off-point is hip-bonemusic.com, where you’ll find yourself up to your eyeballs in books, instructional videos, online lessons, and other treasures. You should also check out his fabulous interview series called Bone2Pick.\n\nMichael is a huge inspiration to all of us in the brass world, and he was one of our funnest and funniest interviews we’ve ever done. We hope to get him back on for round 2 someday. Until then: this interview was a ridiculously easy edit—-there was so much amazing stuff in there that we basically kept everything. So, enjoy!\n\nLove,\n\nJoel, Tom, Chris - Monsters.\n\n January 01, 2020 January 01, 2020/ Joel Baroody\nHappy New Year everybody! Thanks for being Brass Chats fans. Exciting stuff to come this year! Okay, enough of that——on to this month:\n\nRemember last month when we opened with “Michael Sachs is….not like us”? Well…..had we interviewed this month’s guest first, he definitely would’ve gotten that sentence. JACK SUTTE! Is……Not. Like. Us. (In a good way but) Not. Like. Us.\n\nTune up the video to feast upon stories about his first day on the job in Cleveland back in 1999, playing TOMASI—in high school 🤮🤮🤮—and if your screen doesn’t recognize those, they were barfing faces—, why he doesn’t have a DAILY ROUTINE (?!), and how he switches between playing orchestral 2nd trumpet and the MOST CHALLENGING SOLO REPERTOIRE EVER WRITTEN. He’s on a quest to record every trumpet sonata in existence, and we are not joking, so if you want to troll him, WRITE SOME MORE TRUMPET SONATAS SO HE’LL NEVER FINISH. …but he’s damn close, so get moving!\n\nSpeaking of getting moving: it’s our hope that this month’s (and every month’s) Brass Chat is part of the tonic you need to motivate, inspire, and encourage you down on your paths of musical productivity in the new decade. We have big goals, and so do you. Thanks Jack Sutte, for helping us take the first step!!\n\nLove you all,\n\nJoel, Tom, Chris - Monsters.\n\n November 28, 2019 November 28, 2019/ Joel Baroody\nMichael Sachs is….not like us.\n\nHIS TRUMPET SOUND is comprised of equal parts pure molten gold, Old-Testament-fire-and-fury, new puppy fur, goose-pimple-shivers, maple syrup, Mahler’s image of heaven, heartbreak, and electrocution; OUR SOUNDS are comprised of equal parts desperation and diarrhea. HE’S spent more hours deciphering voodoo elements and tweaks of trumpet construction (MANY details in the interview, that you can try!!!!) than WE’VE spent actually playing the trumpet…..HE knows how to approach James Stamp exercises, and WE, as it turns out…….don’t.\n\nWant to learn how to play Stamp? You’ve come to the right place!\n\nWant to learn some trumpet tweaks that you can do, today, to make your horn play better? You’re about to listen to the right guy! (…it’s a wormhole, but it’s worth it!)\n\nWant to hear what a big-5 principal learned from watching Nolan Ryan (one of the greatest pitchers of all time) warm up? Hit that play button.\n\nHanging with Michael Sachs was an absolute treat, and he was generous with his time and info—we’ll hit him up again someday, because the hour wasn’t nearly enough!\n\nHappy Thanksgiving! We love you all and we’re thankful to all our Brass Chats guests, thankful that we get to do this, and thankful that you like watching.\n\nLove,\n\nMonsters\n\n April 20, 2019 April 20, 2019/ Joel Baroody\nFrom the desk of Tom Brown, 1/3rd of Monster Oil:\n\n“It was 1998.  I had just finished up my undergraduate degree and was trying to figure out why I still had fundamental issues with the trumpet.\n\nI had countless friends who went on and on about what Indiana University Professor John Rommel had done for their playing, so I gave him a call. That first hour I had with him was the most inspirational hour of my trumpet career.  \n\nIn this lesson he had the courage to tell me I was fundamentally playing the trumpet incorrectly, that there was an easier way, and then proceeded to tell me how it could be fixed. \n\nFast forward to the summer of 2018.  I purchased a 2000 Lincoln Town Car station wagon (don't ask) that had a tape deck.  So I went into my garage and the first tape I pulled out of an old box (full of maybe 200 tapes) was THIS lesson.  So....this was meant to be.\n\nI called Professor Rommel and asked him if he'd be ok with us releasing it as a Brass Chat.  He said sure (mostly).  So I spent a fair amount of time cleaning up the sound quality which was pretty bad.  And I must say the tape is as inspirational today as it was then.  \n\nThankfully for you, I don't do much playing in the lesson.  He talks most of the time, and the info is applicable to pretty much anybody who plays, not just me.  \n\nDon't worry, this isn't a substitute for a proper Brass Chat with Mr. Rommel, but we thought you might find it interesting.”\n\nThere it is—fabulously inspiring raw trumpet content, rescued by pure serendipity from the bowels of an old stinky cardboard box. Your brain is like a stinky cardboard box right now; fill it with this tape to fix!\n\nLove,\n\nMonsters\n\n March 10, 2019 March 10, 2019/ Joel Baroody\nHere is our prescribed method for watching this, our latest installment of Brass Chats, in FOUR easy steps:\n\n1.  If you’ve never watched Thomas Gansch and Mnozil Brassperform before, find them on Youtube and watch them blow a couple tunes out of the water. If you’re already familiar with them, go watch your favorite one\n\n2.  Search for your jaw on the floor, wipe your tears away, mend the shattered pieces of your broken heart, and pull yourself back together as you get ready for step 3\n\n3.  Watch this interview with our new favorite human being, Thomas Gansch\n\n4.  Go back, armed with what you now know about fearlessness, individuality, sound concepts, performing concepts, artistry, emotion, theater, Al Pacino, and much more, and repeat step 1 for a whole new experience\n\nThis method will be the best hour and a half you’ll spend all year on becoming a better artist. If we still haven’t sold you (which, why are you even on this page), within this Brass Chat you will find Thomas Gansch’s ruminations on:\n\n-   the beginnings of Mnozil\n\n-   the correct and incorrect pronunciations of Mnozil\n\n-   the key to cosmic understanding\n\n-   finding his own musical identity\n\n-   falling in love with jazz\n\n-   the best trumpet player that has ever walked this planet\n\n-   how much he practices per day\n\n-   who he wants to play at his funeral\n\n-   the most important thing in life (spoiler alert: it may or may not be five hundred dubba C’s in a row)\n\n-   the secret to his unstoppable endurance\n\n-   his daily warm-up/routine\n\n-   Mark Gould\n\n-   his biggest vice\n\n…and much more. Eat up, you savages!\n\nLove,\n\nMonsters\n\nPS: if you’ve never seen Mnozil, start looking for the next time they come to town. It is a different, much better experience than watching them online, and is worth missing your grandma’s birthday, or taco night, or church, or your kid’s recital, or your kid’s first steps, or your kid’s birth, or whatever you people do in your free time. Cheers!\n\n November 06, 2018 November 06, 2018/ Joel Baroody\nChad Winkler is magical, on so many levels. Well…at least two: …okay, two and a half:\n\nFirst level, obviously, would be his trumpet prowess. Second level, there’s this. …I know, right?! And the half-level? Chad tells us his favorite magician in the famous Monster Round.\n\nWhy on earth do you care about that? …You don’t, of course. But maybe you will care about:\n\n-   What he learned from George Vosburgh\n\n-   Chad playing the Posthorn solo at Mahler’s grave\n\n-   Chad’s obsession with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra\n\n-   The best horns Chad’s ever played\n\n-   The meanest thing he’s ever said to a student\n\n-   How a warmup should never last more than ten minutes\n\n-   and much more.\n\nIntrigued? Tantalized? Invigorated? Motivated? Fumigated? CONSTIPATED?!?! US TOO!!!!!!!!\n\nEnough poop jokes. Go get better at music! It’s BRASS CHATS. Hit it!\n\nLove - Monsters.\n\n October 02, 2018 October 02, 2018/ Joel Baroody\n[Brass Chats Season 2, Episode 9: David Bilger]\n\nDavid Bilger, Principal Trumpet of the Philadelphia Orchestra, spills his guts and tells you how he got so good.\n\nRead More\n\n September 03, 2018 September 03, 2018/ Joel Baroody\nSo, in December of 2017 we went on an epic adventure and filmed 10 episodes of Brass Chats around the country. Among these was Scott Laskey, who we caught up with at the Midwest Clinic in Chicago.\n\nAfter the trip we had some planning to do, including the order in which these Brass Chats should be released. We based our decisions on a few criteria, and ended up deciding (back in December) to release Scott's chat in September, 2018. \n\nIf you're here, you probably know by now: Scott passed away about a month ago. He will be dearly missed by the trumpet, brass, and music communities. We very much regret that he never got to see this Brass Chat, which is absolutely fantastic and will be appreciated and combed over for many years because of the wide array of topics he covers, and the wisdom he brought to the table.\n\nIn a first for Brass Chats, we have decided to release this Chat unedited. We don't want you to miss out on any part of this interview, which was among his last. It runs for about one hour and fifteen minutes, and as you'll see, could have gone muuuuch longer if time had permitted. If you need more motivation to watch, the following phrase might help: \"Bud Herseth's mouthpiece.\"\n\nThere will be no coupon code this month. Don't buy Monster Oil... Instead:\n\n1. Email scottlaskeymemorial@gmail.com with your best Scott story. This is something his family has set up, and we can't wait to see the final product, so don't delay.\n\n2. Grab your favorite Laskey mouthpiece and play as loud as you're able for as long as possible in your next practice session.\n\nWe will miss you, Scott! Thanks for everything you did for the trumpet world, and thanks for hanging out with us. \n\n August 06, 2018 August 06, 2018/ Joel Baroody\nBuckle up, it's Brass Chats time! This month's candidate is a real treat. If you want to know:\n\n-   what it was like playing with Chris Martin\n-   how many practice hours you should be putting in on your instrument\n-   how to get an efficient warm up in twenty minutes\n-   how to be a more consistent player\n\n...look no further than Brass Chats, Season 2, Episode 7: Tage Larsen. He's the 4th/utility trumpet player with the legendary Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and if you listen to him chat with us for a bit, you just also might hear about:\n\n-   his favorite new exercise craze\n-   singing in a reggae band\n-   just what in the heck he has to do with the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.\n\nJoin us! Thanks Tage!!!\n",

    "passage": "1969 American Football League season\n\n[The Chiefs topped the Raiders in the 1969 AFL championship game.] The 1969 AMERICAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE SEASON was the tenth and final regular season of the American Football League (AFL). To honor the AFL's tenth season, a special anniversary logo was designed and each Kansas City Chiefs player wore a patch on his jersey with the logo during Super Bowl IV, the final AFL-NFL World Championship Game prior to the AFL–NFL merger.\n\nThe Chiefs defeated the Oakland Raiders in the final AFL Championship Game, then soundly defeated the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV.\n\n\nDivision races\n\nIn its final two years of existence the AFL had ten teams, grouped into two divisions. Each team played a home-and-away game against the other four teams in its division, a home-and-away series against one of the five teams in opposite division, and one game each against the remaining four teams from the opposite division. Using that format, the defending World Champion New York Jets went 10–0 against the five teams they played twice (i.e., their four weak divisional rivals plus last-place second-year Cincinnati) while going 0–4 against the top four teams in the West.\n\nFor the 1969 season, a provision was made for a four team playoff to determine the AFL Champion, the league's representative in the Super Bowl, with the #1 team in the division to play against the #2 team in the opposite division. The NFL also had a four team playoff, introduced in , matching the winners of the Capitol and Century divisions, and the Coastal and Central divisions.\n\nThe 1970 merger placed the 10 AFL teams (along with 3 teams from the pre-1970 NFL) into the 13-team AFC. (The other NFL teams went into the 13-team NFC.)\n\n  Week   Eastern #1            Eastern #2                   Western #1                   Western #2          \n  ------ ------------ -------- -------------------- ------- ------------------- -------- ------------------- --------\n  1      N.Y.

The latest option for the would-be EV owner certainly hits most of the right notes to be a hit. The Hyundai Kona EV is a crossover, the body style so on-trend that it made Ford kill all its old-fashioned cars. The 64kWh battery gives it a range of 258 miles, and on the latest fast-chargers it will go from flat to 80 percent state-of-charge in 54 minutes. And it comes with all the latest advanced driver assists and a rather funky interior. The only thing we still don't know is the exact price. But since Hyundai told us it's meant to be competitive against the Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and that elusive standard-range Tesla Model 3, expect a pre-incentive price to start somewhere around $37,000.\n\nOur first experience of the little Kona crossover was back in April when we tested a pair of its gasoline-powered variants. The Kona EV is built on the same bones, but Hyundai's design team has given it a unique styling treatment inside and out to distinguish this all-electric one from its internal combustion engined siblings. Most noticeable is the new nose. Hyundai is eschewing the idea of making all its models look identical, and battery EVs don't need to suck in lots of fresh air to feed an engine. So the Kona EV ditches the big grille for a much more aerodynamic front end.\n\n\nIt slips through the air\n\nYou can see the quest for aerodynamic efficiency elsewhere. The underbody airflow is managed by covers and air deflectors. The actual air intake (in the lower part of the front bumper) is active and closes when appropriate to further cut drag. And the alloy wheels are mostly flat, with few openings to minimize turbulence. The result is a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.29. That's better than the regular Kona (0.34) and the Chevy Bolt (0.32) and on a par with Jaguar's I-Pace, but it's not as good as the Leaf (0.28), Audi e-tron (0.27), or Tesla Model 3 (0.24). (CdA, where the drag coefficient is multiplied by frontal area, is the figure that really matters, but OEMs never give out those numbers.)\n\nUnder the skin, the layout is conventional for an EV—the battery pack is between the axle and underneath the occupants, with additional reinforcement (versus the regular Kona) to protect the battery (and the passengers). Like the Bolt and Leaf, the Kona EV is front-wheel drive, with a 201hp (150kW), 291lb-ft (395Nm) permanent magnet synchronous motor coupled to a single-speed reduction gear. The 64kWh battery pack is liquid-cooled, and, as with other EVs we've seen, this system is looped into the car's climate control system to exchange heat with the radiator and air conditioner. (This reduces the need to draw energy from the battery to heat or cool the interior). It's rated at 170kW and has an energy density of 141Wh/kg.\n\nThe Kona EV can DC fast-charge at up to 75kW and 200A (which will require plugging it into one of the newest fast chargers like the kind Electrify America is building). That will take a flat battery to an 80-percent state of charge in 54 minutes. This isn't Supercharger-fast, but it is sufficient to add another 125 miles of range in 30 minutes, Hyundai says. On an older 50kW fast charger, that same 80 percent will take 75 minutes. The Kona EV also features an onboard 7.2kW charger, and, plugged into a 240v outlet, will fully recharge in 9 hours 35 min. While we weren't able to test the entire 258-mile range claim, the car's range calculator seemed to be pretty accurate when compared to our drive route.\n\n\nIt's loaded to the gills\n\nThings actually get a bit more distinct compared to the gasoline Kona on the inside. This is probably a good thing, considering the fact that the cheapest Kona EV is likely to cost almost double the price of the cheapest internal combustion version. There's an all-new center console that stretches out like a bridge between the front seats, and if you opt for the Limited or Ultimate trims, all the seats are trimmed in leather. One thing that isn't really changed is the amount of available space on the inside. There's no getting around it: the Kona EV is a small car. Front seat occupants will have about as much room as in a Bolt, and rear-seat occupants will be slightly more squished than in a Leaf. With the rear seats in use, there's 19.2 cubic feet (544L) of cargo space, which grows to 45.8 cubic feet (1,297L) with the seats folded flat.\n\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard, and Hyundai's infotainment system is actually not bad. The graphics are clear, and I like the UI, which reminds me somewhat of a pre-OS X Macintosh. The Ultimate, which was on hand for our drive, also gets a bigger (eight-inch versus seven-inch) touchscreen. As its name suggests, it comes with _all_ the bells and whistles—the base SEL Kona EV is also well-specced, even when it comes to driver assists.\n\nForward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic collision warning is all standard across the range, which is gratifying to see, as most OEMs lock these options up in the more expensive trims. As you move to the Limited trim, you get exterior LED lighting, wireless phone charging, and a sunroof, with the Ultimate gaining a heads-up display, pedestrian detection, a better adaptive cruise control that will come to a complete stop in traffic, and ventilated front seats, among other goodies.\n\nBut you could have discovered all that just from looking at Hyundai's website. The reason I flew to California was to find out how the Kona EV drives, and I can report that my impressions were rather good. There are three different drive modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport. Eco has the least responsive accelerator and by default the most aggressive regeneration under coasting. In Normal, the accelerator is more responsive, and the car coasts more and regens less when you cruise, and Sport has the sharpest accelerator response and a coasting regen setting somewhere in between the other two. (In fact, there's actually a fourth mode, Eco+, which limits all other power draws from the battery to extend range as far as possible.)\n\n\nSmart deceleration brings a new trick to the EV party\n\nHyundai has thought a lot about maximizing regen; after all, every kWh you can recover from deceleration is a kWh you don't need to suck out of a charger. Where you might find paddles to change gear in some cars, here you find paddles to alter the regen through four settings (0/1/2/3). Holding the left paddle (as opposed to just clicking it to cycle through levels) engages the most aggressive regen, braking the car at up to 0.25G. This will illuminate the brake lights and bring the car to a full stop.\n\nBut the Kona EV has a clever party trick up its sleeve that means you'll use the regen paddle a lot less than the similar feature in Chevy's Bolt or Volt. (This is good, because there was a noticeable delay between using the paddle to increase the level of regen and the rate at which the car slows.) It's called the Smart Regenerative System, and the idea is to keep a consistent rate of deceleration when coasting. On an incline, it will regen less than coming down a hill, and since every Kona EV has a forward-facing adaptive cruise control radar sensor, it will even take into account any cars you're following. That last bit does wonders for cruising in traffic, particularly since the car was able to more finely judge the rate of deceleration than this unfamiliar driver.\n\nHyundai hasn't released a curb weight, but we don't need that number to know the center of gravity is nice and low, and that means a stable ride and little body roll once on the move. The Kona EV feels zippy, but it never encourages you to hustle it down a twisty road the way a Bolt does. Much of our test route (from West Hollywood to Malibu) was spent in traffic anyway, where the combination of that smart deceleration feature and a very quiet interior did much to counter the psychological toll inflicted by Southern California stop-and-go traffic.\n\nThe Kona EV won't be for everyone, but then no car really is. It's cheap and cheerful in the way that any sub-$40,000 EV has to be, because lithium-ion batteries are still very expensive, even when you're subsidizing the model with non-EV versions. Sales will start in California at the beginning of next year and will then spread to the Zero Emissions Vehicles states. A nationwide launch remains TBD; Hyundai North America told me that there's a lot of global demand for the car, and it has to compete with other regions. Expansion outside the ZEV states may happen with sufficient demand and dealer readiness.\n\n_Listing image by Hyundai_\n",

    "passage": "[MF] Imprisoned\n\nDay 1: I am alone. There’s nothing around me but darkness. Well, darkness and the (incredibly rusty) bars of a cage. It’s considerably large, large enough for me to pace around (which believe me, is a feature that I came to love) but the fact that the ceiling is only located about half an inch from the top of my head when I’m standing creates a sense of claustrophobia. There are no exits, no doors, no windows. Just bars. Rusty bars.\n\nDay 2: I awoke to the chilling touch of a winter’s breeze on my face. Strange, because if I remember correctly, it’s the middle of July. I spent most of today peering into the darkness, trying to see if there is anything out there. But no. There’s just me. Me and my cage.\n\nDay 3: Weirdly, today was the first day in which I began to actually wonder why I was trapped in a cage in the middle of oblivion in the first place. For some reason, I didn’t question it until now. This is when the fear began to set in, because as I attempted to cast my mind back to where I was before I was in the cage, there’s nothing. No memories. As if I’ve been here all my life. Which can’t be true. At least, I don’t think…\n\nDay 13: I can hear something. A faint tapping, coming from…well…everywhere. Whenever I turn to face the sound, it seems to move to behind me, above me, to my sides and even underneath me. Which doesn’t seem right since below me is (what I can only assume to be) solid stone.\n\nDay 14: The tapping is getting louder…\n\nDay 15: And louder…\n\nDay 16: And louder…\n\nDay 17: I CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE! It’s everywhere, in the floor, in the bars, in my mind! Just constant, methodical banging drilling itself into my subconscious!\n\nDay 23: I awoke today with the figure of a man outside my cage. My reaction to this was…interesting to say the least. Well, that is if you consider interesting to be screaming at the top of your lungs for 10 minutes straight and trying to force your entire body through a 2-inch hole between some rusty bars. I don’t know why I did this, looking back at it. Something about that figure just…wasn’t right. It made no sound, didn’t move except when it’s head tracked me around the cage and when I finally mustered up the courage to try to touch it, it just…vanished.\n\nDay 26: So today was…interesting. After I woke up, and went through my usual routine: bang on my cage, cry until there are no tears left, the usual, I turned to face the figure, whom I decided to call Nicholas for no specific reason but to entertain myself (I have to entertain myself with something, being trapped in a cage, for over 3 weeks is surprisingly boring, you know?) but he wasn’t there. Instead, he was stood about 5 feet from the cage, seeming floating in the blackness. After I stared at him for about a minute, he raised his arms and his hands began to flow with a dark purple light. I looked at him in anticipation, waiting to see if he moved again, but that was it.\n\nDay 28: Nicholas created feet. I know that sounds weird, but that’s the only way it can be explained. In front of Nicholas is a pair of human feet, the ankles of which are glowing the same colour as the energy floating around Nicholas’ hands. I can’t explain why, but looking at those feet filled me with that same feeling of dread that I experienced the first time that Nicholas turned up, so I looked away.\n\nDay 37: There are legs now.\n\nDay 45: A torso.\n\nDay 48: Left arm\n\nDay 49: Right arm\n\nDay 52: I am anxious now. By this point, it’s pretty obvious that Nicholas is making a person. But the question is, who? That’s the question I ask myself as I stare at the neck of this mystery person, glowing with purple energy.\n\nDay 53: He made me. It’s me.\n\nDay 54: It’s me.\n\nDay 55: It’s me.\n\nDay 56: It’s me.\n\nDay 57: It’s me.\n\nDay 58: It’s me.\n\nDay 59: It’s me.\n\nDay 60: It’s me.\n\nDay 66: ‘I’ am just standing there. Eyes closed. Deathly still. The unrelenting terror I previously experienced from looking at this copy of myself has subsided now, it’s just been replaced with curiosity.\n\nDay 67: It dawned on me that today that in the 67 days I have been here in my rusty cage, I haven’t spoken (aside from the screaming in terror at the presence of Nicholas, and then again at the presence of ‘me’) The reason that I bring this up is because today, after me being awake for a few hours, Nicholas’ copy of me opened his eyes. Then he screamed. The exact same scream I made when he was first created.\n\nDay 68: Today, at first, was a routine day. I marked how many days I’d been in the cage, paced around a bit and sat down and counted the stone tiles that comprise the floor. 594, by the way, if you were wondering. Then I said ‘aardvark’. This surprised me in a couple of ways. First, I was surprised at how my voice sounded as I realized that I had forgotten what it sounded like until that moment. Second, why was I saying ‘aardvark’? So, I sat for a few seconds, in disbelief that I was spontaneously naming mammals against my will, when Nicholas’ copy of me said…” aardvark.”\n\nDay 69: After chuckling to myself about the day’s number, I thought back to yesterday. How the copy of me repeated ‘aardvark’ in the exact same way that I said it. I only thought about this for a few seconds though, as, without warning, I said the word “aback,” A few seconds later, my copy opened his eyes and said “aback.” It then occurred to me that, for some reason, I was involuntary saying every word in the dictionary, in order.\n\nDay 74: “Clairvoyance”\n               “Clairvoyance”\n               “Clam”\n               “Clam”\n               “Clamber”\n               “Clamber…”\n\nDay 96: “Horizontal”\n               “Horizontal”\n               “Hormone”\n               “Hormone”\n\n\nDay 144: “Polyglot”\n                  “Polyglot”\n                 “Polygon”\n                  “Polygon”\n\n\nDay 192: …\n                 …\n                 “Zygote”\n                 “Zygote”\n\nDay 193: It’s over. Finally, it’s over.\n\n\nDay 194: He’s looking at me. I don’t know why. To be honest I’m too exhausted to care. I stand up, he stands up. I walk around, he walks around. I walk up to the bars, he walks up to the bars. A perfect copy, down to every last minute detail.\n\nDay 195: I tend to not move now, as my clone moving around as I do just…creeps me out.\n\nDay 196: He spoke to me today. I walked up the bars, so did he. I looked him in the eyes, he looked me in the eyes. And then he said “Have fun in there,” But something was…off, about how he was talking. It didn't seem natural. I then realized that the reason I dictated the entire dictionary was so he could learn to speak. He no longer looked me in the eyes, he stuttered and his face flushed red. He stood awkwardly, as if he didn’t understand how to look natural. His hands and fingers were constantly moving, as if they didn’t know where to go. Then, suddenly, the darkness vanished. I was in my bedroom, still in my cage, but he wasn’t. I watched him as he took my school uniform off a hook on the back of my door, put it on and picked up my bag. Before he left, he turned to me, still not making eye contact. “Have fun in there,” I rammed against the cage, trying everything I could to break free. I screamed for help, but my voice wasn’t there. I frantically pulled at the rusty bars in the hope that now would be the time they would finally break, so I can be free. But it’s hopeless. I turned around, and saw the hooded figure staring at me. A figure who trapped me in a cage, took away my voice and made a copy of me. A copy that…wasn’t right. It wasn’t me. This hooded figure is keeping me captive as this imperfect copy is out there, pretending to be me, interacting with the world in ways that I never would. I look again at the hooded figure, a mix of anger and sadness in my eyes as the darkness envelops my cage again. This hooded figure, or, as I like to call him: social anxiety.\n",

    "passage": "[HF] [TH] Grey Fields: The Great War (Part 1)\n\nGrey fields\n\nUsing man for war has the same effect on him as using a tool for the wrong purpose. It wears it down until the blade is dull, until the cog is scratched, and until the handle is bent. Man was not made for war. \nSeconds pound me the same as years on old bones. I grind my conscious in search for a stimulant. \n\tI am no longer human.\nI crack and shudder in synch with the shots. The rhythm of cracks and lurches dictates the number of deaths. The amount of hate. \n\tThe cold feel of refined death sits calmly in the absence of warmth in my hands. My clothes hold the memories of past graveyards and their occupants. The grime of this forsaken earth, from the inferno, has become my skin. \n\tMy fellow men suffer with me here. It is here they have come with hope, it is here they will die with none. \n\tThe shriek of the whistle sounds out in the dark of night, and the dust of smoke. I see with the light of explosions, and into the fray I go.  \n\tThe whistle ran into my ears to claw at what sanity remained. With my teeth clenched my hands drew my rifle and my comrades did the same. I clawed my way up the latter, and into the land of death. \n\tThe flashes and trembles of explosions made my head swim. It was like a thousand lions roaring in the smoke. The flashes of bombs in the black sky flickered like lamplights failing to stay lit. \n\tI had grown accustomed to the dark. You cannot see the death around you. You can’t feel the grief. But, in the flashes of men’s tools of death, I could see the faces of my comrades in the dark. They were grim, and had the look of dull machinery. The grey fatigues were tattered like old rags. Fingernails were black and broken. Teeth were like old yellow corks. The flesh no longer hid human souls. \n\tI ran up my latter like a cat scampering up a tree from dogs. The land now in front of me was no longer my fatherland. It was no one’s. The grey land was scattered through and through with flickering fire and empty bodies. Barbed wire rendered much of the land impassable with their bloody hooks. It was like an endless caterpillar slowly treading through the field of battle.  Stagnant liquids, mixed with the blood of man, and the grease and dirt of battle, filled craters and trenches. It was a bleak and dark landscape where nothing was allowed to live. Dead trees protruded from the earth like broken fingers clawing their way to the surface. I viewed the darkened earth for only a moment when I was shoved to the ground. \n\t“Any and all cowards who retreat will be shot! There is no retreat. For the honor of our Kaiser and fatherland!” \n\tThe voice of the unseen man was strong and sure. From the mud I had an eye of the loud man. He was broad, and had eyes flickering with the fires of Hell itself. His face was made fierce with a large greased mustache, and his pickle-hob gave him the height of a great horse. \n\tFrom straight knees he took hold of my dirty fatigues and hoisted me up with such fierceness that I almost cowered from his hand. \n\t“You’re to not stop until you kill your enemy, or your body lays dead. Move now, you’re holding up your latter!” \n\tI was again thrown to the dirt. Around me men were running in complete silence. The bombing had stopped and the silence screamed into my ears. The squish of mud, and the clod of running feet filled the air. I was with men I had never met, or cared to know, but as I ran I felt close to them. I would kill for these men, and I would have family treated to the same degree as the beating hearts of my comrades. \n\tWe all moved together as one entity. We were a grey cloud ready to unleash a hail of unforgiving judgment on our foes. \n\tWhen my head hit the dirt, many others had the same misfortune. Lead and shrapnel \ncracked above my head like a thousand whips on cattle. The night sky glared down with sickening laughter, and I feared that a single move could end my life. The eruption of gunpowder stung my face and violently threw dirt and blood into the air. \n\tI was taking shelter in a crater no deeper than a balled fist. Cannons began to rumble in the distance. Their shells screeching their cry of destruction before impact. I was caked by mud from explosions and bullets kicking up dirt; missing their target. I could see, out of the slits of my eyes, the monster that was bellowing fire and hissing smoke. The gift for our efforts was a hill. The home of the beast. It grinded and clanked. It roared and screeched. It thirsted for blood and was never satisfied. \nYells and whimpers for help scuttled throughout the battlefield. Gnawing at my tattered thoughts. I raised my head in hope for an answer for what I was to do. Eventually, the beast diverted its fire elsewhere, to allow for a chance of slip. I scampered to my sore feet and began to aimlessly jog. It was deathly quiet, but the sound of war still rang on in my head. With my rifle in hand, I searched the graveyard for a living soul. The earlier cries of men taking cover had begun to drop in number until no orders or yells were heard. No noise except for dying sobs. I had unexpectedly felt a piercing into my right side after the first few paces of my wandering. I was shot. The injury wasn’t a mortal wound, but merely a tear of my flesh. The bullet barely missed my rib, and thankfully only skinned me. I tore a shred off my dirty and ragged pants, and wrapped it around my wound with a terrible barb of pain. Whatever was watching over me didn’t want me to die just yet. \nThe land was as red as my flowing wound, and as painful to look at. It was filled with my dead kinsmen. Their mangled corpses are at peace with death now. Their eyes were empty. No soul. My face streamed with grief.  I would kill the damned beast that had murdered these men. \nMy throat cracked and bled. My stomach pleaded for substance. I carried on my search with doubt of ever finding solace. The moon rose up to illuminate my obscure path through piles of dead men. It frowned sadly upon the dead as if they were his sons. The mutilation of corpses marked the end of morality as humans understand it. The burnt and charred flesh would scar the relations of the generations to come. What a miserable thought. The walls of my grievances were broken by a cry of pain. My head was spun on a swivel. The smoke and smell of the deceased stung my eyes and gripped my insides with fear. Who was it? There wasn’t a living soul in my view. The cry came again, and I felt like I would collapse. \nA rustle of dirt caught my eye. I hurriedly approached the movement with curiosity. Under a body, no longer in company with a head, a leg twitched. I heaved the, lucky, dead man off the lone survivor. And here he was, the source of the cries, now scathed by the claw of war.  Bullets had found themselves in his chest, no doubt now in his lung, and one in his lower thigh. His face was as pale as the moonlight, and the gates to his soul were fleeting and forlorn. His age had not yet reached twenty, no older than I. His dirty and greasy blonde hair was matted. His face, sad and cloudy. He lay there panting, and crying away his pain. \n“No, no please… I don’t want to… please no…” Gurgled the dying boy through his blood. \n“Mama, mama, don’t let me…. Die… oh mama.” The fading youth began to sob out loud. His tears mixed with the blood from his mouth. \nI pressed my hands against his soaked chest and silently screamed at myself to say something. His face was a mask of sweat and tears. My attempt to help was replied to with a scream and a frightening jolt from his stomach. \n“No, I need to… I have to… mama I don’t want to…” \nThe young boy coughed, clawed at his wounds, and died under my watch. I felt empty. Lonely and lost. I beheld my hands, now covered with the young man’s blood. I didn’t want this. I trudged on with a weary heart. \nThe sound of artillery rang out louder the more the dead amounted. The hill, the home of the beast, grew nearer. It was a large black shadow in the ever looming distance. I spotted a nearby trench line. It was dark and quiet. I held my rifle close. I attached my bayonet. How low would we fall to kill a man? The thought itched at me as I climbed down into enemy territory. \nThe trench was dark and muddy. It reeked of urine and human odor. My heart was pounding in my ears. This place was a welcome mat to death’s gates. The flow of blood through my aching body was sounding out like a waterfall. My feet made the sound of a lizard slithering through the mud. My thoughts soon wandered off, and with it took my track of time and awareness. I was too far away to hear voices of men who had the same orders as I. Men who wouldn’t hesitate to kill me. \nKashaaa- \nThe noise of a bullet shot above my head like a viper. My rifle dropped from my loose grip as I immediately buckled to the ground. \n“François ou Deutsch?” The owner of the shot yelled cautiously. \nMy mouth was trembling, my heart was on fire, my hair was on edge, and breathes were shallow. \n“Se lever ici!” yelled my assailant. Not knowing how to get out of this predicament, I lunged for my rifle and crouched. Another bullet rang out. It had come from above me, I was in a trench just below the hill, and whoever was shooting at me would have a straight shot at me if I stood. The hill above me cast an ominous shadow overlooking my position. It rendered much of the trench impassable by human eye. \n“révI éler votre personne!” Urged the man. \nI could hear his feet skid down the rocky slope. Quickly, I ducked into the blanket of shadow hovering over my trench. The man soon revealed himself, standing above the trench. He wore a red officer cap, and a blue trench coat. He was very young. A dirty stubble covered his face. His eyes were downcast with large black rings showing the effect of sleep deprivation. I was to his left, hiding in the cover of darkness. Quietly waiting for an opportunity to run. The young man regarded his surroundings, and then grumbled something to himself before dropping himself into the trench with his back to me. I was sure that the pound of cannons in the distance masked any noise I made, but the young soldier swiveled around to face me after a moment of him standing frozen still. With a mix of curiosity, and something that seemed to be fear, he brandished his rifle with bayonet sharpened. He hadn’t noticed me as he advanced, and when my instincts took hold of my body, he was no farther than a whisper away. \nMy bayonet was thrust in the young man’s direction. \nHis rifle parried my clumsy lunge, and was brought up and into my stomach, making me buckle. \nIt was then hit over my back with a crunch. \nI was flat on the ground in a daze. My back felt like a brick had been lodged in it. My stomach was twisted, and I clutched it attempting to find physical relief. During my struggle for air, I groped and threw-up what little substance I had left in my stomach. All the army had to at were dry biscuits, all of the soldiers hated eating them. After being forced to consume them for months at a time, on rare occasions a few of the soldiers would resort to eating their own fingers. These men were then sent away to a field hospital or away from the war to be treated. \nI had the displeasure of remembering the taste, and it didn’t make things any better. The young, tired, man was panting, hunched over. He had his left hand on his knee, and his right hand holding his rifle which was planted by the stock on the ground. His eyes were fixed on mine with a tired look which whispered his hate for war. Why were we doing this? If I had met this man outside of this damned war I might have been his friend. This would never happen though. We were in a war and we were destined to be on the contradictory sides. \nWith a swift movement of my right arm, I took his ankle in my grasp. He attempted to retreat his foot but I wasn’t going to relinquish my grip. He was grounded, with a jerk from my arm, and a loud snap was emitted from his neck. His head had hit a support plank on the dirt wall of the trench. He lay there unmoving and silent except for a gurgling noise in his throat. His eyes were still open, and the fluttered open and shut with a shocked expression. Tears obscured my vision, and I let new found exhaustion overcome me with a tidal wave of grief in due reinforcement.  \n****\nI woke to shallow thoughts and footsteps. The pain in my stomach and back intensified as I slowly recovered from my assault. I accumulated my memories to form a correct timeline of events since the charge. The memories of the young soldier’s death flooded my vision, and I felt empty. I had killed a man who was more than a soldier. He was a man, and he was placed on this Earth with a meaning and a purpose. I took his life without permission and sent it straight to the abyss. One of his vacant eyes was open, and staring into the, still, dark and smoky sky. Dead.\nThe footsteps I had so easily forgotten now shook me from my silent grief. Voices accompanied the march, and they were drawing ever closer. The footsteps were in synch, and the sound of marching rumbled with the beat of my heart. My fear and curiosity were at war, and in the midst of my confusion, curiosity gained the upper hand. I grappled my hands on the walls of the trench and hoisted my head above the trench. A column of men stretching longer than I could see marched on with grim ambience. Many of them wore battered metal helmets with green fatigues while others were dressed like the man I had murdered. Red caps and blue coats. Some bore large mustaches while few were clean shaven and well rested. Even more were bruised and battered. Soaked with mud and blood. Grizzly beards and rough faces. \nMy first plan of action was to sit quietly until I could make an escape, but was soon overcome with doubtful feeling. If I were to attempt to hide, I would found out and potentially killed. If I were to run, I would have no chance of eluding the eyes of the beast. Fear and anxiety broke down my already tired walls, and drove me to anger. Why in hell was I called to fight in this damned war? Who were the men, the great leaders of these countries, to force struggling souls of an already dark world to kill and harm one another on unspeakable levels of cruelty? I fear the future as it should be feared by all good men who are imprisoned on this grey world filled with vile men who want only to cause pain to others for capital and pride. Countries are unions of hate and reckless thoughts against an opposing way of life. We are all told lies. Even the ones who create them. Lies of freedom told to free men.  \n",

    "passage": "\nHot dog store thrives in vegetarian vortex\n\n Wednesday, Oct 9 1996\n\nThey say that every dog has its day. In this reputedly liberal college town, maybe that old chestnut should be amended to include hot dogs.\n\nAt Top Dog in Berkeley, just south of the woodsy University of California campus, meat and libertarian thought have ruled for three decades. Customers waiting for German franks and hot links on a bun can read the walls, which are covered with libertarian bumper stickers, yellowed newspaper articles urging the privatization of the postal service, and hand-lettered signs with statements like, \"Beware the leader\" and \"There's no government like no government.\"\n\nTop Dog's contrast with its surroundings could not be more noticeable. The Free Speech, civil rights, and anti-Vietnam War movements all thrived here. The city council at times appears to prefer debating Big Issues, condemning apartheid in South Africa and establishing sister-city relations with a Palestinian refugee camp. A policy tempest this past spring swirled around establishing sister-city status with Changde, in China's Hunan province, then immediately suspending it to protest Beijing's human rights record.\n\nAccompanying Berkeley's tradition of protest has been a long-term swing away from meat-centered eating, inspired in part by books like Frances Moore Lappe's Diet for a Small Planet, which still is in print after 25 years. Some of the country's finest vegetarian cuisine can now be found here, and meat has largely been on the run.\n\nBut not at Top Dog, celebrating its 30th anniversary as a bastion of carnivorous delights. On Durant, just east of the jammed, patchouli-scented shopping area on Telegraph, proprietor Dick Riemann oversees the management of two Berkeley meateries and checks in with his wife, Irene, who runs a third store in Oakland.\n\nAsked how he accounts for a libertarian hot-dog shop's success in a notoriously vegetarian town, Riemann, 60, says, \"[Berkeley]'s openly socialistic, whether or not they admit to it or even know it, [but] they still get hungry. We're not out there clobbering them with points of view; many people just ignore stuff I put out.\"\n\nAfter an early-'50s stint in the Air Force and a brief teaching career, the Yonkers, N.Y., native and a buddy from Syracuse decided that California was ready for East Coast hot dogs.\n\nThe two opened the first shop in October 1966. \"We opened on a Saturday morning with the paint still kind of wet on the floor. Bingo, we were immediately just mobbed. What we had failed to recognize was that it was a home football game day. You talk about a trial by fire.\"\n\nTop Dog's libertarian angle became prominent after Riemann bought out his partner a year and a half later. Before launching Top Dog, he had run unsuccessfully for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1965, garnering a respectable 9,300 votes on an anti-government platform. \"Man's welfare equals natural resources plus human energy multiplied by tool efficiency,\" he wrote in that year's voter pamphlet. \"Progress depends on investment-inspired profits. Down with government-initiated restrictions, destruction, and tyranny.\" And, far in advance of today's headlines, he wrote, \"Up with free trade between freemen!\" With his lower-key friend out of the picture, he was free to turn up the libertarian message.\n\nThirty years down the road, a sign inside Top Dog reads, \"Politicians Unwelcome,\" and government regulation remains unpopular. As an example, Riemann points to a California Dept. of Fair Employment and Housing sheet headlined, \"Watch Your Language!\" The one-page missive warns employers against publishing \"discriminatory and potentially discriminatory job specifications,\" listing examples of language to be avoided.\n\nSome, like \"draftsman\" and \"girl Friday,\" might strike many as justly banned, but the sheet also warns against innocuous terms like \"student\" and \"honorable discharge.\" Riemann sees this as an affront to free speech, saying, \"Where is George Orwell when we need him?\"\n\nThe local health department also comes in for criticism (though Riemann does follow its rules). \"I don't need a health department to tell me to handle food in an appropriate manner -- my customers would hand me my bank account on a bun if I didn't measure up to their standards. They can see what's going on,\" he says.\n\nIndeed they can. A visitor to the Durant Top Dog could practically reach the grill, where at least five of the 10 available varieties of sausage seemed to be cooking at all times. The cook works right up against the counter, which features half a dozen stools for customers, all of whom are unashamed to celebrate being on top of the food chain. Most business seems to be take-out.\n\n\"I can probably trip over a minor [health] requirement here and there, but listen: You don't feed this many people for 30 years, you don't make a million dollars by poisoning people,\" Riemann says with some satisfaction -- if not without a little exaggeration.\n\nHe also objects to what he says are Berkeley's attempts to regulate his stores' hours -- they are open far into the night and have a late rush from bar closures -- and their customers' smoking habits. A reformed three-packs-a-day man, he nonetheless dislikes \"dictating as to smoking on your own property -- where the hell do they get off telling me that I have to exclude smokers from here?\" The government, he says, is not paying the rent and taxes on what is technically a private space. \"It's not public property just because I cater to the public,\" he says.\n\nWithout any real competition locally, Riemann has tried franchising Top Dog, only to run into what he says are intractable regulations. \"They've made franchising so onerous and laced with legality [in the United States]. ... I want to operate in and on free turf. I don't want to just stick my ass in the air and give the politicians more to aim at.\"\n\nLooking overseas, he tried several years ago to franchise the Top Dog name in hyper-capitalistic Hong Kong, only to have a freak accident sink the business. A crowd celebrating New Year's Eve had gathered on the old cobblestone street just uphill from Top Dog Hong Kong, overlooking the city's financial district.\n\n\"I guess too many drinks were spilled and some of them started sliding downhill,\" he recalls, describing a horrifying scene of hundreds of revelers slipping down smooth, slimy cobblestones to their deaths. \"Twenty-three people lost their lives in a matter of moments just being crushed and thrown into storefronts, fire hydrants, and what have you.\"\n\nAfterward, Riemann says, \"The older Chinese [had] this point of view that where there is violent death you should not go for seven weeks. So the bottom fell out of that market.\"\n\nRiemann currently is looking at the Czech Republic -- with its stronger connection to sausages and hot dogs -- for his next franchising attempt. \"It's the fastest-growing economy in Europe,\" he says, although \"why they want to join the [European] common market leaves me cold.\"\n\nIn between answering questions, he takes phone orders for hot dogs and potato salad. Maintaining high quality is an issue for Riemann, who has hot dogs that are unavailable here trucked in from New York. \"You'll never see a skinless hot dog at Top Dog,\" he says, launching into tube-steak thermodynamics. \"A natural casing will permit smoke and the taste thereof to penetrate the membrane osmotically but not to leave again. And so a sausage with a natural casing will hold onto its taste better. But that is not the case with artificial casings, and skinless have no chance at all.\"\n\nRiemann isn't fanatically pro-meat, however. \"A few people have stepped up to say over the years, 'Why don't you have veggie dogs?' ... I'd love to have veggie dogs,\" he states, \"but where is it? I've tried everything,\" he states. \"The last one almost had the texture of chopped-up inner tube.\"\n\nHe has tried to contact the makers of veggie burgers -- some of which he finds tasty -- about making vegetarian sausages that he can use. \"If you can make a [vegetarian] hamburger patty that is palatable, well what the hell, instead of a patty make a sausage form.\"\n\nThe commercial brands he has tried came up short. Practical considerations are critical, Riemann says. A veggie sausage \"is going to stick and burn, it doesn't generate enough moisture from within, and, admittedly, fat. There has to be a certain amount of fat to fry a sausage.\"\n\nThe times just may be catching up to Top Dog. The Berkeley campus, once the scene of riots and the burning in effigy of then-governor Ronald Reagan, is noticeably more conservative in the '90s. Local legend Country Joe McDonald, famed for his anti-war ditty \"I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag,\" spearheaded the drive for a memorial to Berkeley's 22 Vietnam War casualties.\n\nPerhaps meat will one day regain its place of honor at our tables, but until then Top Dog will continue to lurk on the political and gastronomic outskirts of Berkeley. Riemann is sure the market will provide.\n\n\"If you want a better future, stick to the Yellow Pages. There's your leadership. For all its flaws -- and I don't say that people are perfect any more than I think I'm perfect -- you get your best chance of getting what you want out of life with a viable marketplace.\n",

Finally stepping out I threw my things down on the bed next to my suitcase &amp; walked from my room, down the stairs &amp; finally in to the sitting room where my sister &amp; kids were watching the news intently. \n   \"what am I watching for?\" I asked already Annoyed I came all the way down here to stand in silence when I needed to pack for our trip.\n  \" dude,\" Julia whispered pointing to the tv \"they just had another attack man! This one was totally gruesome, the guy was an old man, he attacked his at home nurse lady thing &amp; she couldn't get her arm away. He bit all the way to the bone &amp; pulled all the meat off her fore arm!\"\n   \"no freaking way\" I whispered feeling chilled\n  \"it's true!\" my son Calvin exclaimed excitingly \"mom,the apocalypse is coming,we gotta get ready for war I need my gun!\" \n  \"this is so weird\" Julia said ignoring her nephew \"this is like outta a movie,I gotta call the girls or Jon.\"\n  \"mom,I need my gun!\" Calvin demanded louder \n  \"Julia don't go freaking any one out\" I said \"maybe it's that weird virus they have been giving everyone shots for.\"\n  \"mom\" Calvin tried again \"I'm serious,I have to protect us!\" \n  But I was to in to listening to the news &amp; I could feel my anxiety rising with every doubtful look Julia gave the t.v.\n\"did you get that shot?\" I asked her\n\"hell no I didn't\" she said whipping her head to the side looking at me \"you know grandad would always say there was something weird about getting a shot of one thing to fight something else.\"\n  \"I remember, that's why I havnt had a flu shot since I was 14 &amp; I didn't get the boys either.\" I stated looking at my other 3 boys on the couch &amp;  back at the t.v . I felt Calvin pull my pant leg from where he sat on the floor next to me trying to get my attention.\n\"stop &amp; wait a minute Calvin\" I scolded looking down at him with the no nonsense eyes &amp; then i zoned in to the news again as they introduced a female reporter on the scene. \n\"early today\" she began \"an in home health care worker,who will rename nameless for privacy, was attacked by one of her elderly patients,who will remain nameless as well, the nurse claimed this man appeared to be in a state of dementia,confused, &amp; unstable.worried she tried to do her job by taking the mans vitals &amp; alerting a relative as was parodical  when he went from being docile to moaning &amp; slobbering she Feared he might be choking on bile so she grabbed a rag to wipe his face. When she went to clean him up he grabbed her elbo pulling her closer &amp; with what a local neighbor reported as a roar of rage bit down removing the flesh from her forearm. The neighbors heard the screams &amp; called 911. Paramedics arrived shortly but the nurse had lost consciousness in the neighbors arms &amp;  was pronounced dead on the scene. Now We have recently been informed by a reliable source that the wound was so deep it severed all the veins in her arms causing a bleed out. The police report they found the elderly man still in his bed eating the last of the woman's flesh. When they tried to approach he appeared to be growling &amp; began to lash out. He was unresponsive to warning shots &amp; was  refusing to be subdued. With  no other choice available they had  to take immediate action &amp; shoot him down. Now back to you chad.\" \n  Finishing she lowered her mic &amp; waited as the screen split to another reporter at the station who was waiting with questions,\n Looking bewildered chad cleared his throat &amp; asked\n\"so Miranda,you mean to tell me this man was shot &amp; killed at the scene?\" \n\"yes chad,\" she answered \"there were many attempts made to take the attacker in but there wasnt any controlling this man.\"\n\"this seems to be the 3rd case documented this year of aggressive, animal like behavior  displayed by people whom other wise didnt exhibit such personality traits. I know that most states including ours have legalized marijuana do the police think maybe this was a drug induced state of delusional hysteria?\" chad questioned\n\"well nothing has been ruled out as of yet,but I was told by the chief of police just minutes before this broadcast that they fear it might have been due to the Nauru virus.\" Miranda confided\n   \"I'm sorry Miranda im slightly confused. wasn't it mandatory in all the states for everyone to receive the new vaccine to insure the safety of our country?\" \n            \"yes chad it was,unless you're unemployed, not an active student or work a minimum wage job thats not in the food industry.\" Miranda answered \n   \"are the shots still available?\" chad worriedly asked\n\"they are\" Miranda answered sweetly \"memorial hospital is giving the shots from 8am to 8pm everyday for free while supplies last. The elderly &amp; children are seen first of course but chad this nauru virus is a serious thing &amp; I urge everyone who hasn't gotten one to drive down &amp; get in line. U will be protecting yourselves from this virus as well as helping protect others.\" \n   \"well Miranda that sounds like something everyone.....\n   \"bubble butts,bubble butts\" sang the fish cartoon\n \"Kenny!\" Julia &amp; I yelled at the same time \"why did you change the channel!?\"\n\"that was a stupid show,&amp; I'm bored. I wanna watch cartoons mom.\" kenny whined \n\"just let him\" Julia said getting up from the recliner she was sitting in &amp; walking to the stairs \"we have to pack anyways.\"\nI felt Calvin pull on my pant leg again &amp; I looked down at him \"what?\" I asked tiredly. The news report had taken to much outta me I was feeling my anxiety build &amp; all I wanted was to sleep now.\n\"can I have my gun now,pleeaase?\" he pleaded\n\"Calvin,when I go to visit Aunt Janie tomorrow I will make sure u know where it is but son there isn't any reason for it. The world isn't headed for an apocalypse,aliens aren't going to attack, vampires won't swoop outta the sky &amp; werewolves won't be going through the garbage. Calm down.\"\nSighing i Followed my sister up the stairs to finish the reluctant packing I had to finish so I would be prepared for the days I had to stay in Tyler trying to help my eldest sister Janie. \nWe had been receiving worried phone calls from Janie's neighbors for a few months before we came for this visit.  She was bi polor &amp; a heroin addict. She had been in &amp; out of every mental hospital &amp; rehab possible. Our oldest brother had left corpus &amp; moved to Tyler to take care of her about 6 months ago. No one else knew what to do.\nJanie was the oldest. She had been bounced from house to house as a child. Relative after relative had taken her in. She was the shame of my mothers late teen years &amp; my grandparents felt she should pretend nothing happened &amp; let them sweep janie under the rug like dirt.\nNone of it seemed to bother our mother. No,it seemed to set a pattern for future events. If it did bother her then or later as the years went by she covered it up with alcohol. All of us children would be passed out eventually. But it seemed as bad as the rest of us might have had it Janie got it the worst.\n She was reminded daily by all the different relatives that she was inferior,defective,a sin. That she should be thankful for the barest of necessities. She wasn't allowed a childhood,children should be seen not heard. she was forced to stand in a room &amp; be belittled in front of strangers while her flesh &amp; blood played the martyr. She was branded a liar early on so if she ever spoke out no one would believe her. She hit puberty early. Scared &amp; confused she went to her care giver an aunt &amp; asked if she was dyeing. Janie burst in to tears when she was told that she was a whore,the devils mark was upon her. Why else would a 10yr old have these symptoms!? The treatment got worse, as she blossomed. Janie  was beautiful. She stood out in the family. She was tall,long red hair,ivory skin,green eyes,high cheek bones &amp; full lips. The jealousy from her cousins was so thick in the air it could have choked people. She was looked at first at any church/school funtion &amp; this caused resentment from her aunts who felt their daughters were of purer blood,superior so to speak. The attention men gave her wasn't even noticed by Janie who believed she was ugly. She good naturally &amp; naively held conversation happy someone wanted to talk to her. She had no idea she was the perfect target for a pervert. She was molested. When she tried to go for help she was returned home &amp; turned over to the very aunt that had turned a blind eye to the happenings. She could careless if Janie was abused,the old man had money &amp; that helped the family. Janie didn't deserve any better,better was for her daughters,her princesses.  Janie ran away. From there she spent her life on the street,drugs took away the pain &amp; sex paid the bills.  Janie got the raw end of the deal, Janie paid for the sins of the family. Thankfully janie never had children.\n             Once we were old enough &amp; told about her we grouped together &amp; found her. We understood what it was like. We couldn't pretend she didn't exist. We tried to help,we each took a turn letting her stay in our homes,we found her counseling,doctors,medicine. but she couldn't be changed. Sometimes she was a danger to others. Eventually after all the years of abuse she did to herself to dull her pain she was a shell of what she once was or could have been. She left one day with out so much as a bye or fuck y'all. about a year later we got a random call from her. It was nice to know she was alive. She had gotten social security &amp; was trying to make a life in Tyler Texas for herself. We were happy wished her luck &amp; told her to call more often. She sounded much better possibly happier. \nBut in our family good things never last. We should have known it wasn't as good as she had us believe.we had all grown up putting on plays,telling fibs to cover up how bad it was. We were a family of the best actors any where. So when the cops found a way to contact us &amp; started calling we shook our heads &amp; felt like idiots. Why didn't we see deeper? Did we not want too? Did we look away like so many others did her? She was lonely &amp; we had asked to many questions she didn't want to answer. She felt we would judge her,so she lied. Eventually the truth came out when her episodes got to outta hand.\n  The first trip to Tyler we talked with all her neighbors,passed out our numbers,explained she was sick. We begged them that if there were issues to please call us &amp; not the cops unless it was a dyer situation in which the feared for their or her life. \n   Soon the calls poured in. We became good friends with Mr.Byers who lived a few houses down. He was head of neighbor hood watch &amp; had been elected the caller when our sister got outta hand. He was never rude or angry truth be told i think he had a soft spot for my sister. His daughter had died of a drug overdose &amp; i think he saw her in janie. The stories he told us were put in a way that u would believe he was talking about a child.  He had patience &amp; sympathy not many would have. None the less there was always something.\n           Janie  was naked in the front yard howling at the moon on all fours, Janie was jumping from trees scaring children, Janie was letting junkies camp in her front yard. Surprisingly when she shot up she mellowed out. She was well behaved &amp; we never got a call. But as tiresome as her actions grew we never wished for her to self medicate so we could have peace.\nfinally it had gotten to the point  Janie tried to commit suicide by downing her meds &amp; drinking watered down bleach in the front yard while having a garage sale. People who had stopped by to see what she was selling stood shocked &amp; sweet mr. Byers had to call an ambulance &amp; then us. We were flabbergasted &amp; out of options. Some one had to go to tyler. So we sent our brother Jon. We figured he could check on her,possibly admit her to a hospital for serious help. But as fate would have it when Jon got there he met the neighbor girl Rachel. It was love at first sight &amp; he settled in with Janie deciding crazy was worth  being close to The angel he had found. \n Things went ok for about a month. Janie was happy to have family with her. But she slowly started to slip &amp; it got worse,Jon couldn't control her any more. He was going insane himself.  She would have fits,she would spit &amp; scream,she accused him of wanting her dead for her house,she hit him in the head knocking him unconscious with a chair when he walked in from work on day &amp; when he came to she was crying on the floor cutting herself with a broken beer bottle. He woke up on random nights with a knife to his throat. H had to drag her away from a toilet during an attempt at drowning herself &amp; then hold her while she sucked her thumb &amp; cried herself to sleep. She walked around naked in drunken stupors trying to seduce him.  Janie was just to far gone. It was over, she had lost it.\n  He called home,he was tired. he couldn't take it any more. Rachel had agreed to marry him &amp; move home to our small town of calallen with him. He felt he had done his brotherly duty he was done. It was now our turn.\n  So as a group we four sisters packed up for a week in Tyler to get our deranged sister situated in an assisted living placement for the mentally unwell &amp; find a realtor to sell her house so we could cover the costs of her expenses.\nWe all made arrangements with our jobs &amp; me with my kids. bright &amp; early the next morning we were ready to leave. I kissed my boys goodbye,hugged my grandmother &amp; bitterly crawled in the back of my sister Joyce's truck for an unwanted journey to east tx. None of us were to happy. It's not that we didn't want to help but having to put our lives on hold was getting taxing to say the least. We were all comforted in the thought that this was the last time &amp; Janie would be safe from herself in an adult home. We could make visits with out apologizing to neighbors or cops. We could be semi normal &amp; still love our sister with out the hostility &amp; regrets of not wanting to clean up her messes &amp; take care of her.",

    "passage": "[NF] Be Happy at All Times.\n\n\nbe happy at all times\nnever stay angry, hold grudges, or talk badly about someone else\nfind a way to love everyone and tell them why you do\n\n\ttoday friday october 17th 2014 will hold the title for the day the most intense thing has ever happened to me.  \n\tthe day started off normally as any day on the golf course would.  the day before, thursday, we had done most of the hard work around the course, i had string line trimmed the edge and banks of the sand bunkers and finished the day spraying ponds… no easy task! \n\twhen i arrived friday morning and parked in my usual spot by the entrance to the shop, i was greeted by my coworker Mike.  He looks to be 55, heavy set but not fat, balding head with white hair he covers with a faded blue baseball cap, grey shirt and blue jeans.  “Did ya work hard yesterday?”, he asks somewhat mockingly, I ignore the jest.  Gathering the things for the day from my car, with my back to the entrance i hear him again.  “yo dom, did you guys work hard yesterday?”  i’m not sure if he is just joking, or whole-heartedly is curious.  sharply, i say “yea man we weed whacked trap bank edges, got sand in my eye and shit, thats probably why you called out yesterday, to avoid the hard work!”  mike explains his wife actually had a bad fall and was bruised and he needed to stay home to help her.  makes me feel like shit for accusing him of calling hookie, so i apologize and brush it off.\n\tStart of the day, i am to mow fairways on the back nine, have my first two fairways done and i am half way through my third.  I see my coworker mike again coming along the cart path, i have to look forward to continue to mowing a straight line but i acknowledge him with a head nod, and out of the corner of my eye, i see he does the same.  I finish mowing the first half of the fairway and start to mow the other half about 10-15 minutes after i first saw mike.  As i go to empty the grass clippings my fairway machine collects, i see mikes cart.  At first i think nothing of it and begin to empty the buckets of grass clippings…  the fairway mower has 5 buckets to empty.  i empty the first bucket, go to put it back in its place and think to myself “that is a curious place to park your cart”  i write it off, “maybe he parked there to stay out of the mud, and walked his mower to where he was working”…. grab and empty the second bucket, “i don’t see him anywhere near this cart and its not exactly the closest spot to where he should be going”  replace the second bucket and start emptying the third “maybe he is just taking a bathroom break, there are some trees near there, thats probably what he is doing”.  third and fourth bucket emptied and replaced… i reach for the 5th bucket “well if he is taking a piss i will be able to see him from here, or he will eventually have to walk back to his cart”  replace the 5th and final bucket and begin to climb onto my machine.  the machine’s seat holds you a good 4 feet off the ground so the perspective from there is much better and i can see that on the back of mike’s cart is the machine he is supposed to be mowing with.  i stand up on my machine to see even further, i don’t see him anywhere near the cart or in the woods peeing, or on his phone by a tree or anything.  i don’t see mike at all, it looks like he just disappeared!  i hope off my mower and start walking towards his cart.  I’m squinting my eyes and scanning the landscape trying to find him.  his cart is parked by a few big rocks at the corner of a hair pin turn.  the top of #14 tee to be exact, and beside the cart is what looks to be those grey stones.  i am walking towards the cart, staring at the stone closest to the cart.  i take a quick paced step once i see the stone looks to be too large to be the stones i know to be placed there.  like seeing lightning strike in front of you, in a flash i realize that is not a stone, an instant passes, and the roaring thunder of realization comes with a fast growing rumble, and an ear shattering and unstoppable crash of understanding.  beside the cart, laying on the ground, is my co-worker mike.  \n\tmy very next step is fully extended and propels me forward, my legs are stretching and throwing my body forward at full speed.  i am running as fast as i possibly can and realizing more with each pounding step, mike is on the ground, why is mike on the ground, i hope he is just stuck or can’t get up, he’s face down.  Oh my god, he is face down!  i send the signal to my legs, FASTER - NOW FUCKERS - MOVE ITTTT!!, they can’t move any quicker, they are at maximum speed, i stretch my legs to increase my gait.  i can’t get to mike quick enough, he is less than 50 feet away and it is taking AGES to get to him.  I’m screaming his name now, screaming and running and i can’t get there fast enough.  finally I’m right over him, immediately i can see the back of his shaved head is purple.  i flip mike over screaming for him to respond, hoping, praying, pleading that i will turn him over and he will be breathing.  when i roll mike over and saw his face it uncontrollably shocked me.  i didn’t have time to be taken back or even react to it, just a momentary pause for the flood of emotions to be processed.  i had smashed through the glass and into chaos, utter despair, pure horror and fear.  Mike’s face was more purple than the back of his head.  his face had been smushed against cold solid mud, it hadn’t stuck to him or gotten into his nose, but his cheek and upper lip looked smushed, his nose too one nostril held closed against the ground.  the impression the ground left on his face did not immediately snap into place.  slowly the skin faded to it’s original resting place, but it was still off.  his face looked distorted, wrong, purple and smushed, his eyes half-open half-closed and completely expressionless.  he was always smiling or showing how he felt right on his face, big cheesing smile, round cheeks and bright eyes behind his glasses.  t didn’t look like him, wasn’t alive like he was, it was flattened and dull, emotionless and frozen. i caught myself honestly questioning if this was even mike.  there was no way to escape the cold hard truth, it was mike, and he was in extremely bad shape.  \n\tbefore i had even seen mikes face, before i even knelt beside him, somewhere along the never ending run i had realized already what was going on and what i had to do.  my brain was making checklists, ordering them for me and coming up with instructions for my consciousness to eventually follow once it had caught up to the realization of what needs to be done.  i had wasted so much time it felt like, i had JUST turned him over, JUST slid next to his side and still i felt like it was forever ago i realized he needs help and what needed to be done was already behind schedule.  fumbling and crying and screaming i paw for my phone.  I’m about to be an emotional mess i think to myself.  another part of me is impatient, and it takes over, i dial 9-1-1 for emergency help for the first time in my life.  press enter, there is no ringing or waiting, at least that i remember, it seemed as if i was instantaneously connected and a woman was asking me “where is the location of your emergency”  i’m flooding her with information, a constant stream of consciousness frantic at first and then steady and continuous flow.  “1800 tournament drive off of 202.  its blue bell country club, but that is the address for the main building, we are out on the course.”  I am talking right over her questions, comprehending them seconds later and without pause answering them in a constant flow of words.  ambulance is on it’s way and i want to start compressions, i’ve already been trying while the 911 operator was getting the information from me.  i ask her to instruct me to give cpr, i have half an idea what i am supposed to be doing and have been doing it and continue to as she describes to me the process.  i am impatient and keep telling her to start counting out when i should be doing compressions, finally she gets to it: “1,2….3,4….5,6…..7,8….”  i can feel his rib break, it’s disturbs me but i’ve heard that is better to have a broken live and be alive.  i have the operator on speakerphone and I’m giving mike chest compressions.  “…hands right between his nipples, pushing with the heel of your palm, use both hands to compress the chest two inches downward.”  we count 100 compressions and check for a response, count to 100, and check for a response.  before the first 100 is complete i can hear sirens coming.  I’m so happy someone is coming and it encourages me.  i look at mikes smushed purple face, nothing moves except when i compress his chest, and it deflates me again.  I wish someone else would do this or i could just stop and cry about it but the part of my that feels that way is not physically in control of my body.  i check his mouth and keep saying his name.  my body is in control of doing compressions, my mind is listening to the operator for cues when to send the signal to my body, and i am staring at mikes face.  I’m feel I’m not even doing the compressions, really I’m not, I’m unable to do that, I’m looking over my own shoulder, crying, sobbing, drumming up and pushing down ebbs and flows of hope and despair, my weaker self incapable of anything but encouraging my mind and body to continue.  i am shattered, in shambles, suddenly I’m sucked back into my own body: desperately trying to make my compressions where they are supposed to be, as deep as they are supposed to be, on perfect timing with the operators instructions, acting with determination and courage.  \n\tit has already dawned on me, and i refused to to swallow it, so i spit it back out.  mike is dead.  i knew it from the second i rolled him over to see the grotesque purple smushed face.  mike is dead and there is nothing i can do, it was too late from even the moment i saw him.  he has laid face down for too long.  i deny it and deny and and still to this moment right now writing this i want nothing more than to believe he will be ok.  i want him to be ok, i beg for him to be ok, i would do backflips and marry this man if he is alive and i will never lose contact with him… but very sadly, very hard to admit, or to say, or to let myself think… out of fear that believing it alone might make it true, or that not acknowledging if he is alive or not may give him advantage.   mike is not ok, mike will not start breathing, mike has died.  i am full.  i have already eaten to my capacity, i am not hungry at all.  in fact the sight of food, even the thought, makes me sick!  and now, laying before me is a full feast for an army.  each bite is force fed to me, spooned in my mouth and forced down my throat.  his purple smushed face, a huge chunk to swallow, i can’t please no more.  i already have a stomach full of my own problems, my own stress, my own emotional turmoil.  one more bite!  forced into me, so much to digest and i don’t want it.  i have enough already.  each spoonful bigger then the last.  i refuse, i won’t even think about it, focus on something else.  time inevitably passes and i forget to keep forgetting what happened.  a thought slips in, the worst are the images, tactile memories, very small, seemingly insignificant details are the biggest pieces, dense and heavy, hard to digest.  i can’t seem to even get them past my mouth, i keep tasting them over and over, just want them to be in, so they can be closer to being let go.  mike was happy all day, literally said “no one can bring me down today”  he was singing all morning, happily accepted what everyone would agree is a hard job, even took the hardest route of that job.  this started out well written and I’ve given up, i just want the words to be here before i devote my mind to forgetting them all.  so sad.  i want to put in here too but i can’t find a segway.  chuck talked to mike when he drove by him, told him he didn’t look good and should take it easy or take a rest,  mike said he was working hard and sweating but it was “good exercise”  i thank all my lucky stars that mike was in a really good mood, and hope that he was at least happy.  i really want nothing more than for mike to be alive.  i can’t help but think that he is dead.  i want him to come back, i hope to everything and anything wether i believe or not, i hope and beg anything, anyone anywhere please let mike live.  let him come back to life and be ok!  \n\nbe happy at all times\nnever stay angry, hold grudges, or talk badly about someone else\ntell everyone that you love exactly how you feel about them\nbe happy at all times, to the best of your ability\nmake friends and strive to keep them\ntell people when they do good\nplease and thank you\ni love you\nbe happy at all times",

    "passage": "When I read of the Cam Newton pay-for-play allegations, it's hard for me not to feel the ghosts of Albert Means lurking somewhere in the shadows. Now, from the outset, I'm not going to declare that all of the allegations made so far are true, or that all of the reasonable inferences that can be made from the current allegations are also true, but I do think it's fair to say that if the allegations regarding Newton are true, for better or for worse, the only real comparison can be the Albert Means scandal.\n\nHaving said that, I do think it is at least somewhat instructive to look back on the Means scandal all these years later and take a second pass at what all occurred and what all that scandal revealed about the inner workings of big-time college football. With that in mind, let's go back to the SEC of about ten years ago.\n\nNow, from the outset, the Albert Means scandal probably needs no real introduction on an Alabama blog, but just to discuss this in its entirely let's hit the basic overview of what happened. In its most basic form, Alabama booster Logan Young paid a six-figure sum to Lynn Lang, the head coach of Albert Means, to steer his star recruit to Tuscaloosa, with Lang intending to split the money he received from Young with his assistant Milton Kirk. As it came to pass, though, Lang cut Kirk off from the money flow, eventually inducing Kirk to spill the beans first to the NCAA and later the Memphis _Commercial Appeal_. Despite a great deal of investigation by various federal and state agencies, no great amount of hard evidence surfaced to support the allegations, but nevertheless Alabama was hammered by the NCAA and Young was later convicted based almost entirely on the allegations made by Lang and Kirk.\n\nBut if you are going to legitimately believe what Lang and Kirk had to say, there were actually a lot of violations made by a lot of schools that ultimately did not win the Means sweepstakes, and years later a civil lawsuit revealed even more than most could have ever imagined.\n\nStart with the official visits, which were not free. It was apparently pay-for-play even for the right of wining-and-dining Means on your campus. Milton Kirk did not mince words in the aftermath, if there was no money fronted, there was no visit, period. Three of Means' five allotted visits were made -- to Alabama, Kentucky, and Georgia -- and the visits required payment of 4,000 to 6,000 dollars. Those payments were made, allegedly by Logan Young ('Bama), Bill Harper (Georgia), and an unidentified booster (Kentucky).\n\nAnd that was just over official visits. For his actual signature, the bidding went higher and higher.\n\nGeorgia made their way into the mix, allegedly with the aforementioned Bill Harper, a Georgia booster from Memphis. Harper inevitably denied the allegations, claiming he was a small-time businessman with no money, but he did admit that he had lunch in Memphis with Lang and Georgia assistant coach Leon Perry -- the coach who recruited Means for Georgia -- to discuss the recruitmentof Means. Moreover, Lang also alleged that Georgia head coach Jim Donnan gave him 700 dollars to work a camp in Athens. According to Lang, Donnan tried to round up the money for Means' signature until the closing minutes before he ultimately signed on the dotted line, and that Donnan talked to him by phone several times in the final week before National Signing Day.\n\nKentucky entered the battle largely with the help of recruiting coordinator Claude Bassett. He arranged a meeting with Lang and Kirk in a Lexington hotel before a Kentucky basketball game where an unidentified Kentucky booster gave him an envelope with 6,000 dollars enclosed in it to pay for the official visit. After that exchange, Kentucky continued to bid for Means' signature, and another 1,000 dollars was given to Lang for working a camp. In the end, Lang said Bassett continued to try to round up money for Means' signature until Kentucky landed Dewayne Robertson from nearby Melrose High -- a future top five NFL Draft pick in his own right -- at which point he pulled out of the bidding war for Means. Not coincidentally, Bassett was later fired after, among other things, he admitted to sending 1,400 dollars to Melrose head coach Tim Thompson.\n\nAnd, if you believe the tale that Lynn Lang ultimately told, not only was Ole Miss in on the bidding, they were the ones who actually started the whole damn thing, planting the seeds of hope in Lang's mind that indeed he could formulate a pay-for-play scheme. It was Ole Miss assistant coach Kurt Roper -- who, after a three-year stint in Knoxville working under Phil Fulmer, was new to the scene after the Rebels hired David Cutcliffe in the wake of Tommy Tuberville leaving for Auburn -- that tracked down Lang and wanted to know precisely what it would take _financially_ to get Means to sign:\n\n  \"He [Kurt Roper] said, 'Coach, I need to know exactly what it's going to take financially to get Means so that I can take it back to my people. I just told him a house and two cars, and he said that wouldn't be a problem.\n\n  Lang talked to each of the [Ole Miss] coaches when that day was done. All of them, he said, indicated that they'd be willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to get Means.\n\nArkansas was also firmly in the mix. Arkansas assistant coaches Fitz Hill and Danny Nutt -- brother of head coach Houston Nutt -- recruited Means, and together they met with Lang at his Memphis apartment, where Lang informed them that the price tag was 200,000 dollars. Lang later claimed that Fitz offered him a job as defensive line coach for the Razorbacks and that he would place 80,000 dollars in cash in a bag and leave it for Lang under a bridge at an unspecified location. Later in an interview with NCAA investigator Richard Johanningmeier, Hill essentially confirmed the allegations, and admitted that he told Lang that \"Arkansas did not have a problem with the request.\" The involvement by Arkansas in the bidding war is even more hypocritical in light of the fact that Judge Steve Wilson -- the judge who presided over _Cottrell v. NCAA_ -- detailed in his book that it was not Tennessee, but Arkansas that originally turned Alabama in for allegedly paying for Albert Means.\n\nLang also alleged that Memphis, the home city school, eventually got in on the bidding as well, though it seems their limited budget reduced the amount of their bid. Lang claimed that Memphis head coach Rip Scherer himself directly offered free law school tuition for Lang's wife at the University of Memphis School of Law.\n\nMeanwhile, in Knoxville, Phil Fulmer had been busy sending out memo after memo to SEC commissioner Roy Kramer, blaming Alabama for damn near everything from the crucifixion of Christ to the Holocaust. He bemoaned the supposed cheating ways of Bear Bryant, the influence of Logan Young on Memphis-area recruits, and made allegations that Alabama practically bought every player imaginable. He also claimed some off-the-wall things, like that Tennessee booster Roy Adams was a \"queer,\" and that then-Ole Miss coach Tommy Tuberville looked the other way on the pay-for-play violations because he wanted the Alabama job:\n\n  \"Roy Adams is a queer who associates with anyone who will hang around him from any school anywhere. He has been disassociated from any contact with our program for the whole time I've been the head coach and well before that.\"\n\n  \"He [Tommy Tuberville] won't talk about Logan because he wants the Alabama job. Logan likes Tommy and will let Tommy \"keep a few.\"\n\nFor a concrete example, here is the infamous \"FOR YOUR EYES ONLY!!!\" memo he sent to Kramer on May 20th, 1998, where he alleges, among other things, that Logan Young bought Freddie Milons, Kendall Moorehead, and Eric Locke, and speculating that Young was buying David Payne and Santonio Beard:\n\n[Foryoureyesonly_medium]\n\nIn the end, despite being an early participant in the pay-for-play negotiations, Tennessee did not recruit Means, and we later found out why. Early in the recruiting process, Tennessee assistant coach Pat Washington -- who was the starting quarterback for Auburn in the mid-1980's, including during the 1985 Iron Bowl -- recruited Means for the Volunteers, and Lynn Lang sensed his desperation. Early on, anyway, with Washington making the early offers, Tennessee was in the bidding process as well.\n\n  \"He told me his job was on the line and that he needed Means because he had lost David Paine and Kindal Moorehead to Alabama. The first amount he talked about was $50,000, and then $75,000. But this was about the same time they had all that academic stuff [the Linda Bensel-Meyers allegations] going on, so I think he got cold feet.\"\n\nWith that, Tennessee backed away and did not actively recruit Means. But they didn't just fade away, they blew the whistle on Lang.\n\nAnd what about the SEC? What if I told you that they knew about the whole thing all along? Well, believe it or not, they did.\n\nThe SEC, in fact, had actually been conducting their own investigation of Logan Young for quite some time. As evidenced by a June 23rd, 1998 memo from SEC investigator Bill Sievers, a former FBI agent, to Roy Kramer, Sievers had begun actively investigating Logan Young and keeping Kramer up-to-date on his findings, and also hired a private investigator -- Ed Bradberry -- to assist him in the investigation. Among other things, Kramer wanted to know whether or not Young was using casinos to funnel money to prospective recruits (sound familiar?). In the course of his investigation, Sievers gave Bradberry the task of, among other things, going through Young's garbage outside his home, getting a security contact at the Horseshoe Casino in Tunica (where Young was known to frequent), following Young to his hangouts and overhearing conversations, and obtaining the copy of an incident report relating to the arrest of Young's son.\n\nThe following year, on July 26th, 1999, more than six full months before National Signing Day, Sievers informed Kramer in the following memo that, per the information provided to him by Pat Washington, Lynn Lang was attempting to sell Albert Means in a pay-for-play scheme.\n\n[Doc3_p01_medium]\n\nArmed with this knowledge, did the SEC inform Alabama, and presumably other SEC schools? No. Instead, as per the memo, the SEC strategy was to have Washington continue recruiting Means and then possibly at a later date have Washington record his conversations with Lang so that he may be prosecuted for extortion and bribery:\n\n  \"Coach Lang's actions amount to soliciting a bribe and extortion. We have the opportunity to have Washington tape record his conversations and have law enforcement authorities prosecute Lang. While this may sound harsh, I believe it will put a stop to high school coaches soliciting money from SEC coaches and send a strong message to others.\"\n\nAnybody up for one of those, \"SEC! SEC! SEC!\" chants right about now?\n\nAnd, in the end, even Albert Means himself turned out not to be the innocent prey that was long claimed. He was portrayed throughout the entire NCAA investigation, as well as the Logan Young trial, as a victim, an otherwise oblivious kid who had known nothing but poverty while the man he trusted the most betrayed him and sold him by the pound to the highest bidder in a modern day slave market while he and his family struggled to merely survive on the tough streets of Memphis. The story that his mother was making minimum wage while supporting a family of six with no knowledge whatsoever of the pay-for-play scheme was told time and again. As it turned out, however, Means was just as crooked as anyone else involved in this circus. Years later he testified and confirmed that he never took the ACT, and that Lang arranged for another student to take it for him, thus paving the way for him to qualify academically when in all honesty he should have likely never been allowed to set foot on an SEC campus. Finally, after Logan Young had been convicted by a jury, but before his sentencing, Lynn Lang came out and admitted that he had given Means and his family approximately 60,000 dollars in his final two years of high school. When later asked by the _Commercial Appea__l_ whether or not he actually received any money, Means refused to deny it, and uttered the following mind-numbing statement before hanging up the telephone:\n\n  \"Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable? I don't know.\"\n\nYears later when all of the dust had settled, Cecil Hurt said it best:\n\n  \"This was no crusade. There seems to have been no real victims and far more perpetrators than the NCAA was willing to prosecute.\"\n\nThe point of all of this is that, much like the Albert Means scandal, there is probably a hell of a lot more going on than what initially meets the eye with the Cam Newton saga. It's rarely as simple as school _x_ payed player _y_ amount _z_. Or, as the allegations of this case dictate to this point, father _x_ solicited school _y_ for the signature of player _z_. It did not seem that way at first with Means, and some may think it does not seem that way with Newton now, but when the dust settles that will likely prove to be as true regarding Newton as it did with Means.\n\nAnd I'm no grand conspiracy theorist, mind you. There are no black helicopters circling outside your house, nor did the gub'ment put fluoride in the water to control all of our minds. But it doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to see how that beneath those endless SEC chants are twelve member institutions whose interests are often divergent, who are constantly competing with one another tooth and nail for the tiniest bit competitive advantage -- never kid yourself, football is a zero-sum game, I can only win if you lose -- and that the SEC office itself can have an agenda of its own and does not always live up to its self-proclaimed purpose of assisting its member institutions in the maintenance of their athletics programs.\n\nFor the Cam Newton saga, what really happened and what is really transpiring within the SEC and its member institutions? No one can say that with any degree of certainty at the moment, and on some level we may never know. Had it not been for two high school coaches talking to everyone who would listen and Tommy Gallion filing a civil lawsuit, we would have never found out all that we know about the Albert Means scandal, and it will probably take an inside source who played a key role in the Newton recruitment to come out publicly with that same kind of zeal for us to find out what really drove Cam Newton to sign with Auburn. Having established that, though, if history is any guide, what is going on behind the scenes of the Cam Newton saga, past and present, probably is not nearly as simple and straightforward as many would lead you to believe.\n",
    "question": "Summarize the Albert Means scandal.",
    "answer_human": "Albert Means was an American Football player with high prospects in high school. Many teams wanted to sign him, and they were willing to pay him, his coach, and many more people to make it happen. Means' high school coach, Lynn Lang, took money from Alabama booster Logan Young, Georgia's Bill Harper, and an unidentified booster from Kentucky, to arrange visits for talks. Albert Means was offered $60K in his last two years of high school to play, and another student was arranged to take the ACT in his place so that he qualified academically for college football. The payments discussed for his signature from different clubs were a house and two cars (Ole Miss), $200K (Arkansas), and the like. SEC was aware of Young, but they didn't intervene to gather more evidence and opt for a harsher judicial result to dissuade similar pay-for-play schemes in the future. In the end, Young reneged on his promise to share the bribe from Alabama for Means' transfer with his assistant coach Milton Kirk. Kirk spilled the beans on the affair to many people, and Alabama and Young were indicted. ",

    "passage": "QUICK LINKS: ADVANCE! ANALYSIS | PRELIMINARY CELEBRITY ANALYSIS | FREEWINDS ANALYSIS | SOURCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe Church of Scientology typically trumpets \"stats through the roof\" and \"unprecedented growth\" at Scientology events. However, a careful look at Scientology's own statistics shows that Scientology's growth is slow ... and some numbers (such as the number of new Clear attests each year) indicate that Scientology is shrinking.\n\nScientologists learn to look at statistics to gauge an individual's success. What do these numbers say about the Church of Scientology, and about its ability to tell its members the truth about the state of affairs?\n\nTo get a more accurate picture of Scientology's health, I am collecting stats, based on the completions lists published in Scientology magazines, and bit by bit, I am graphing them.\n\nThe primary sources for these statistics are Scientology's main US magazines:\n\n-   Advance!\n-   Advance! ANZO\n-   Advance! Europe\n-   Advance! UK\n-   Auditor\n-   Auditor UK\n-   Celebrity (CC Int)\n-   Freewinds\n-   Impact\n-   Prosperity\n-   Source\n\nI also have a collection of org magazines from individual Scientology orgs, including Ability, Achievement, Cognition, Enhancement, Gateway, New Era, Purpose, Survive, Success Gazette, and Understand. (Since I live in San Francisco, I am especially interested in Gateway.)\n\nIf you have suggestions for this site or would like to contribute information that could be used here - especially additional statistics - please contact the site owner, Kristi Wachter, at info@truthaboutscientology.com.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompletions\n\nCompletions lists from Scientology magazines have been posted to the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup (also on Google), providing something that's often lacking when discussing Scientology's expansion (or lack thereof) - real data.\n\nI am working on compiling these statistics and analyzing them, with the invaluable help of others who are interested in these statistics. I'm also creating an index to the newsgroup messages, making it easier for people to view the raw data and do their own analysis.\n\nIf you have any data from old Scientology magazines (or new ones!), your contribution to the data collection would be greatly appreciated. I posted to alt.religion.scientology and alt.clearing.technology requesting any information people have.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvance! Magazine\n\nFrom the completions lists posted from Advance! Magazine, we can see that little real expansion has taken place in the last three years. A boom in OT Eligibility completions in the middle of 2001 has fizzled out.\n\nAs of this writing (July 2002), Advance! 159 has not appeared yet, even though Advance! 158 came out in April 2002 and that issue covered three months (rather than two), since issue 157 appeared in January.\n\nFor numbers and graphs, please see the Advance! Stats page.\n\nAn excellent post to alt.religion.scientology by Cerridwen shows that the statistics can be misleading, since the issues do not come out on a regular basis. Source 138, the June 2002 issue, included four months of completions, while issue 137 had only covered two months. While four months of Clear attests may seem higher than two months, once you average the numbers over the reporting period, the picture can change.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Completions Data\n\nI have a motley assortment of Scientology magazines that people have sent me, and I've culled as much information as I could find from completions lists posted on the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup.\n\nI've summarized that completions info on a quick-and-dirty \"this is my first attempt\" page. As I collect more data, I'll begin creating pages for various subsets of data. The Advance page listed above is one; I'll try to do a page for Freewinds, Source, and Auditor as well - along with some of the org magazines I've gotten. I may also try to do other types of subsets, such as number of Clear attests or number of Purifs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou Can Help\n\nYou can help make this project more useful by\n\n-   suggesting additional ways to organize and present the data\n-   providing data\n\nYou're welcome to send me an e-mail with suggestions or information. You can also send me your Scientology mail.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNumber of Churches and Missions, Number of Staff, Number of Members\n\n\"Scientology's Statistics\" from _Scientology With(out) An End_ by Tom Voltz uses Scientology's own published statistics from _What Is Scientology?_ It shows that\n\n  Over a 15 year period, the number of churches grew, on average, at the rate of barely 4.8 percent per year. The missions did a little worse. For them the average growth was only 2.6 percent per year.\n\nand\n\n  If we take the number of staff on July 31, 1977 as a base, and compare it with that of 1990, which is 10,224, then the number of staff, from the middle of 1977 to 1992 grew at a rate of 3.8 percent.\n\nNumber of New Clears Each Year\n\nCornelius Krasel's Growth of Scientology page cites total numbers of Clears from various Scientology publications between 1966 and 1996.\n\nI have created my own chart, based on his numbers; where there was no specific number available (for example, 1967-1973), I approximated an average number of new Clears based on the next year for which I DID have data (so, for 1967-1973, I estimated an average of 500 new Clears a year). Those years are marked below with an asterisk in the last column.\n\nAs you can see, at no time in the history of Scientology has the organization been producing so few new Clears a year.\n\nThe latest issues of Scientology publications list just a few new Clears:\n\n-   Advance 156 lists 12 (Nov 2001)\n-   Advance 154 lists 7 (July 2001)\n-   Advance 151 lists

    "passage": "Muzio Gambit\n\nIn chess, the MUZIO GAMBIT, sometimes called the POLERIO GAMBIT, is an opening line in the King's Gambit in which White sacrifices a knight for a large lead in and chances. It begins with the moves:\n\n    1. e4 e5\n    2. f4 exf4\n    3. Nf3 g5\n    4. Bc4 g4\n    5. 0-0\n\nWhite offers a knight, aiming to exploit Black's weakness on the f-file[1] to attack the black king. Other possibilities for White's 5th move are 5.Bxf7+ (Lolli Gambit), 5.Nc3 (McDonnell Gambit), 5.d4 (Ghulam Kassim Gambit), and 5.Ne5 (Salvio Gambit), but 5.0-0! is generally reckoned to be White's strongest option,[2][3] and in fact 4.Bc4 (rather than 4.h4) is usually played with the intention of playing a Muzio. Black can avoid the Muzio with 4...Bg7, and this has sometimes been recommended as a safe and practical over the board choice.[4]\n\nThe _Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings_ classifies the Muzio Gambit under code C37.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe opening was originally analysed by Giulio Cesare Polerio in the late 16th century;[5] the first recorded game is by the Neapolitan player Geronimo Cascio in Alessandro Salvio's _Il Puttino_, published in 1634.[6] The name “Muzio Gambit” originated with the early 19th-century English chess writer Jacob Sarratt, who misattributed the opening to Cascio's contemporary Mutio d'Allesandro in his translation of _Il Puttino_. In its original form, White used Italian-style free castling, placing the king on h1 and rook on f1, for an even stronger attack since checks by a queen or bishop on the g1–a7 diagonal are no longer available as a defence.\n\nThe opening reached its peak popularity in the mid 19th century, the Romantic era of chess, when sacrifices and early attacks were considered the pinnacle of chess art. Its popularity declined with the improvements in defensive technique exemplified by players such as Louis Paulsen and Wilhelm Steinitz; however, it is still occasionally seen, usually at amateur level.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n1. E4 E5 2. F4 EXF4 3. NF3 G5 4. BC4 G4 5. 0-0 GXF3\n\n    If Black postpones taking the knight with 5...d5, White obtains a strong attack beginning either 6.exd5 or 6.Bxd5.[7]\n\n6. QXF3 QF6 (diagram)\n\n    “The thematic starting position in the Muzio. Black's last move is very definitely best since it not only barricades the f-file but also impedes the formation of a white pawn centre with d4.”[8] A sideline is 6...Qe7, where White's strongest reply begins 7.d4 Nc6 8.Nc3 as in Steinitz–Anderssen (), London 1862.[9][10] Walter Korn gives simply 7.d3! followed by 8.Nc3 for slight advantage to White.[11]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    GM Dmitry Andreikin played the rare move 6...Bh6 against Hikaru Nakamura in the 2010 World Blitz Chess Championship, eventually losing.[12] Marović and Sušić wrote that 6...Bh6 is unhelpful to Black, due to 7.d4 Qh4 8.Nc3 Ne7 9.g3 fxg3 10.hxg3 Qh3 11.Rf2.[13] According to Keres, Black is less than after 6...Bh6 7.d4 Qf6 8.e5 Qf5 9.Nc3.[14]\n\n7. E5\n\n    “The most logical. With this extra sacrifice of a pawn White opens up new lines for attack.”[15] A more reserved continuation is 7.d3 Bh6 8.Nc3 Ne7, when 9.e5! Qxe5 10.Bd2 to the 7.e5 main line, whereas 9.Bxf4 Bxf4 10.Qxf4 Qxf4 11.Rxf4 f5! leads to an advantage for Black.[16] Also possible is 7.c3 Nc6 8.d4 Nxd4 9.Bxf7+ Qxf7 10.cxd4 Bh6 11.Nc3 d6 12.Nd5 Be6 13.Nxf4 Bxf4 14.Bxf4 0-0-0 15.d5 Bd7 16.Qc3 Qf6 17.e5 Qg7 18.Rae1 (18.e6}}) 18...Bb5 19.Rf2 Ne7 20.Qa5 Nxd5= (Korchnoi).[17]\n\n7... QXE5\n\n    and now White's main choices are 8.Bxf7+ and 8.d3:\n\nDouble Muzio: 8.Bxf7+!? \n\n8. BXF7+!?[18]\n\n    This is known as the DOUBLE MUZIO, “the best version of the Muzio” according to Keene.[19] It is very dangerous against an unprepared opponent; however, its has been called into question.[20]\n\n8... KXF7 9. D4 (diagram) QF5\n\n    Traditionally, the most popular move has been 9...Qxd4+; then after 10.Be3 Qf6 11.Bxf4 British correspondence grandmaster Peter Millican asserts that the position is “objectively equal”,[21] while Scottish grandmaster John Shaw says “If I was guaranteed to reach this position, I would recommend 4.Bc4 and the Muzio...”. Shaw sharply criticises 9...Qxd4+ which “grabs a meaningless pawn, opens another line for White's attack and makes the black queen vulnerable on the dark squares”;[22] grandmaster Neil McDonald even goes so far as to suggest that 9...Qf5 may be the only playable move.[23]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    After 9...Qf5, Shaw cites the game Showalter–Taubenhaus, New York 1889,[24] which continued 10.g4 Qg6 11.Nc3 Nf6 12.Bxf4 d6 13.Bg3 Kg7, as an example of a successful defence by Black. Yakov Estrin suggests 11.Bxf4 Nf6 12.Be5 d6 13.Bxf6 Bxg4 14.Qg2 Rg8 15.Kh1 Bf5 16.Qd5+!, assessing the position as better for White. McDonald disputes this assessment, saying Black should win after 16...Kxf6 17.Nc3 Nc6 18.Rxf5+! Ke7![25] Both Millican and Shaw recommend 10.Bxf4 rather than the “loosening” 10.g4,[26] though Shaw describes it as “unconvincing” after 10...Nf6.[27]\n\nMain line: 8.d3\n\n8. D3 BH6 9. NC3 NE7 10. BD2 NBC6 11. RAE1 QF5\n\n    White was believed to be better until this move was suggested in 1858 by a Milwaukee player identified only as “W.S.”;[28] previously 11...Qc5+ had been played. Louis Paulsen introduced the new move during his match with leading Austrian master Ignatz Kolisch in 1861, winning the game after a well-conducted defence.[29][30]\n\n12. ND5 KD8\n\n    with continuations:\n    -   13.Qe2 (a move attributed to the British amateur R. E. Lean, sometimes misidentified as “Maclean”) and now:\n        -   13...Qe6 14.Qf2 (neither 14.Nxe7, 14.Qf3, nor 14.Bc3 is better) 14...Qf5= (draw by repetition); if 14...Qg4 15.h3 Qg6 16.Bxf4 White is better (Znosko-Borovsky).[31]\n        -   13...b5 14.Nxe7 (according to Tim Harding, 14.Bxf4! gives White the advantage[32]) 14...Qc5+ 15.Rf2 (Berger[33]) Qxe7 (Korchnoi gives 15...Nxe7!,[34] whereas Keene gives 15...Nxe7 16.Bc3 Re8 17.Bxf7 Rf8 18.Bd4![35]) 16.Qh5 Qg5 17.Qxf7 bxc4! 18.Bc3 Rf8! 19.Bf6+ Qxf6 20.Re8+ Rxe8 21.Qxf6+ Ne7 22.Qxh6 cxd3 23.cxd3 Rb8 24.Qxh7 Rb6 25.b3 Ng6 with clear advantage for Black.[36]\n    -   13.Bc3 and Black has three satisfactory squares for the attacked rook:\n\n    :* 13...Rg8 14.Rxe7 Nxe7 15.Bf6 Re8 16.g4 Qg6 17.Qe2 Bf8 18.g5 d6= (Bilguer).[37]\n\n    :* 13...Re8, here White has tried 14.Bf6 and 14.Nf6, but best is 14.Qe2 Qe6 15.Qf3 Qf5 16.Qe2= (drawn by repetition, Keene–Pfleger, Montilla 1974).[38][39]\n\n    :* 13...Rf8! 14.g4 Qg6 15.h4 Nxd5 16.Bxd5 f6 17.Qe2 Ne5! 18.g5 Bxg5!

    "passage": "THE GIRL\n\nThe Girl\n\nThere is a pulse to everything in life; a steady rhythm that resonates through this world, setting a pace for the mad race to nowhere we all seem to be competing in. Whether it is the catchy beat of a song stuck in our head as we bike to class, the violent rumbling of a towering thunderstorm, or the pounding heartbeats of two lovers beating in unison at the start of a sleepless night, every moment in life has a distinct cadence that seems at times to be the only thing pushing time forward. It can inspire euphoria or strike fear in our hearts, but with no regard for anyone else it presents itself and begs for our attention.\n\nIt was the chaotic ringing of my alarm clock and subsequent pounding in my head that woke me up this morning. Like a bat out of hell the shrieking of that damned machine cut through the peaceful realm of my dream, dragging me into reality from some beautiful fantasy forever lost to the deep crevices of my subconscious.  Sometimes I feel as though the hardest thing in life is dragging my ass out of bed after a long night. My dorm room is small and my roommate is either miraculously still sleeping or trying to salvage his own fantasy from the rude awakening of my alarm clock as I fumble to turn the damn thing off. Contrary to what most people believe, there is no such thing as silence. In the absence of my alarm, silence does not settle on us but rather the subtle vibrations of a hundred other students quietly preparing for the morning class we never should have signed up for. The scraping of my toothbrush, the hum of the AC kicking in, the roar of water rushing out of the shower head to meet me head on; one noise leading to another to compose the jumbled melody that echoes through the dorm hall and out into the crowded streets where it joins a symphony of cars, bikes, morning joggers, and disgruntled youth on their way to class. \n\nSoon I was a part of that symphony, playing my own part as I crawled to class. I put my headphones in to drown out the cacophony around me with something a little more familiar. I pressed the shuffle button and the song reminds me of a girl. My heart beat speeds up and joins the music as a wave of emotions rolls over me. Just as the different sounds of my morning routine had given way to one another so did my emotions. Joy at first, that she was coming in town to see me. Then doubt, that she would still feel the same as she did when we last spoke. Fear, that I wasn’t good enough. Anger, that I had once done wrong by her, putting me in such a delicate and unsure situation. Hope, that maybe we were still recoverable. It had been almost two years since I messed up, and here she was driving 6 hours just to see me. \n\nThe fluctuations of my emotions settled into a steady drone of uncertainty as I crossed the street. The blaring of a car horn interrupts my favorite part of the song and I flick off the driver who was apparently so inconvenienced by a 5mph decrease in speed that he needed to let the whole block know. Asshole. \n\nThe sun is warm on my back but a cool breeze pushing against me sends shivers down my spine. The thud of each footstep sends unwanted vibrations through my sore legs, and a stronger gust of wind presses against me. I imagine that with a mind of its own the wind was begging me to turn around. “Sorry,” I think, “my math professor probably won’t accept “the wind told me not to come” as an excuse for missing the quiz today.” I hate this class. While it may be easy, it’s also all the way across campus and at 9 in the morning. \n\nI miss summer with no responsibilities: when I could stay up late and look for trouble without a care in the world. We got in a big fight this summer; me and the girl did. It had been the first time we had spoken in over a year, and we were both drunk. She told me I didn’t deserve her. The worst part was that she was right. We didn’t talk again for a long while after that. Then out of the blue, about 2 months ago, she texted me. Somehow the conversation never ended. We talked everyday, and while it was strange at first, we slowly evolved, or perhaps regressed, to a level of comfort neither of us had known for years. It was great. Is great.\n\nNine impressive booms brought me back to the present as the clock towers time reverberated across campus. I picked up my own pace knowing I hade 10 minutes to get there, my footsteps matching the beat of Mr. Kanye West’s music. I almost tripped stepping off the curb to cross the final street, my math building directly ahead. Embarrassed I glare at the chubby kid passing on my right who had let out a short laugh at my expense. Another car horn from my left requests a vulgar reply but my world is spinning before I have the chance to accommodate it. \n\nAll I see is the blue sky; it really is a nice day. Something hurts, but I don’t know what. My head feels wet, and somebody is kneeling over me yelling something. I want to ask her to talk slower but my voice escapes me. \n\nI remember six years ago when I first met her, the girl that is. A teacher kicked me out of my reading class because I would finish my work too fast and pester the other kids. I was placed into an advanced program for students who “though outside the box” as they said. I didn’t really care at the time, I wasn’t the most popular kid and another class just meant another group of assholes who wanted to prove they were better than me. This class was no exception. Some guy spent most of class pretending to yawn as he flexed for the whole class, and girls just loved it. But she was in there. She liked him, but that was to be expected. He was confident and athletic, me: not really either. \n\nI hear a siren coming, and I want to tell them that it really is unnecessary; I’m fine. \n\nIt’s Valentines Day and I’m anxiously sitting in second period. I had bought her flowers the day before. Two roses to be delivered sometime this period. I can hardly contain myself. My best friend runs into my class laughing hysterically. He says I spelt her name wrong on the card, first and last. I can’t believe it. I’m so embarrassed. That familiar racing of my heart, the loud anxious beating that seems to have been ever present in my youth, sends blood rushing to my cheeks. \n\nSomebody is pressing on my chest, and blowing into my mouth. I think about asking the paramedic if he plans on buying me dinner after, but that would probably be awkward. The tempo of his hands weighing into my chest reminds me of my own heartbeat, which strangely is suddenly so much quieter. \n\nIt’s been a month since I butchered my Valentines Day plans, and I pass the girl and her new boyfriend walking down the hall. I decide to take the long way to class from now on, and I’m swallowed by a sea of noisy students performing a piece unique to the depravity of middle school. \n\nThe paramedic’s head is eclipsing the sun behind him, and I realize for the first time this morning just how cold it is. I feel the cool breeze flowing over me. Sandwiched between the cold ground and the paramedic, I remember the gust of wind that had asked me to turn back. I wish I had listened. \n\nIt’s 3 years ago. I’m a sophomore and a little more mature than the awkward preteen who barely survived middle school. Through some bad experiences with girls I’d become a little jaded. The disappearance of the ignorant nice guy persona ironically gave way to a more confident attitude that some described as me being, well, an asshole. I walked through the door of my Spanish class and my eyes immediately fell on her. The girl, who sat right next to me, was dating some other kid in the class, but that didn’t stop me from trying to occupy all her attention right in front of him. She was temporarily out of reach, but I was making an impression. As the teacher’s instructions began to fill the room with the unfamiliar tone of a foreign language, I glance over at her, she at me, and I wink. \n\nThe paramedic stops performing CPR. His tireless effort seems to have finally found success. But the sad expression on his face and the stillness of my chest forces me to realize the alternative. \n\nIt’s October 10, 2009, a little over two years ago. Or maybe it’s the 11th, I’ve been drinking and time loses meaning on nights like these. I pull my shirt over my head, my pants long gone. The girl pulls me on top of her, and we kiss. Four long years brought me to her, and there is nothing in my world except the pounding of her heart against my chest, the rhythm of our tongues, and the room spinning around me. But before we could proceed a thundering knock interrupts our perfect moment. Somebody calls up that my dad is drunk and at the front door.\n \nI realize that this might not end the way I’d hoped. Everything seems distant, surreal. I want to look around me but I cant. I want to get up and run back to my dorm but I cant. I’m stuck on the ground surrounded by the pulsating whaling of police sirens that for once in my life is comforting. \n\nIt’s December 28, 2009, and I’m carrying flowers towards her front door. It’s her birthday, and I hear the gentle hum of Christmas music from the other side of the door. She answers the door in a bra and Santa skirt, her perfect body greeting me in a fashion I could never have fantasized. She leads me up the stairs as our footsteps echo through the empty house, and I am truly happy. \n\nThe ever-present pulse that prods life along doesn’t miss a beat, and I can feel it leaving me. All the beautiful sounds of the city are slowing down, and the cries of people around me have all but faded away, but I can’t be mad that the rhythm is leaving me. It has a job to do and I wouldn’t deny the rest of the earth its soothing presence. \n\nIt’s April 12, 2010, a year and a half ago. She is crying. I’m crying. Were standing in the parking lot at sprouts. I’m begging for a second chance, and she doesn’t know what to do. She can’t trust me she says. She doesn’t understand why or how I could do this to her. I don’t either. She drives away, and I’m left standing in the punishing cold, unwilling to admit this is real. I close my wet eyes, and the roar of the wind envelopes my senses. \n\nI feel like I’m sinking into myself. A darkness on all sides begins to encroach on my vision, and a silence settles on me for the first time. There is no pain, except regret. The girl. I wont be able to see the girl tonight. \n",

    "passage": "Deep Sea (World War Z fanfic, sort of)\n\nI chose to write this story because the author of World War Z states that zombies can survive underwater for a long time, but doesn't say anything about what was done to clear them up. Yes, there are references to other famous books/movies in here too, I hope you will enjoy it :)\n\nDeep Sea \n\nOne part of the Z war, or World War Z, as some like to call it, that rarely gets mentioned in history books is the cleanup of the seas. When the war was long won on land and humanity was mopping up the last remnants of zombified human remains, a silent war was still raging under the seas, a war that few ever heard of and whose soldiers are forgotten, relegated to the annals as \"cleanup crews\". Giorgio Pellizzari led one of these crews, the Poseidon #8, in charge of \"disposal, removal and elimination of human remains\". Now retired, the imposing Italian man still sports a fierce white beard that contours his sun-baked face. His blue eyes, specks in the midst of gnarled rough skin have a lively, unbowed look about them.\n\n\"The first thing you have to understand about our work is that the sea covers 71% of the planet, and with man being a land animal and all, it is naturally difficult to make any sort of impact on such an immense, untamed body. Think of navies in the past, of the Spanish Armada in the 16th century, not all of the king's cannon could do a thing to prevent the sea from taking them all.”\n\n“ I think it was the first prerogative of our job, even before the heathen ones, we respected the sea itself. Whenever we submerged we were completely at it's mercy.\"\n\nSitting in his living room, by a warm fireplace, it's hard to believe that this man has come from the coldest hell on earth. Following his exploits in the Atlantic, Pellizzari became somewhat of a legend in the diving community and is credited with having paved the way for the reclaiming of the seas. With the solid education he received while in the COMSUBIN  (Italian Navy's special forces) and his technical know-how of diving equipment, Pellizzari was the ideal choice to lead the \"Poseidons\", as they came to be known. Something about the naval decor of the room, or maybe the set of crossed iron spears that loom over the fireplace hint that this man was something more than a mere cleanup guy. He speaks with a deep voice, accented by his Tuscan origins.\n\n\"Of course, a few divers could do little against the millions and millions of heathen ones that found themselves at the bottom of the sea. If even we fought every day for the rest of our lives we would never be able to finish off all of them, that's why we relied on the tugboats, before the divers...The tugboats were regular fishing vessels, at first we used the modern diesel-powered ones, but you see, today diesel is a luxury, and the little we got was used to operate the machinery. I've got to say, the sea offers all the propulsion you need, for free. We took to converting them to sail, or we found what sail ships we could outright.”\n\n“Three or four tugboats would lower their nets into the ocean, preferably where the seabed was flat and sandy and start dredging the seabed, back and forth, scooping up all the heathen ones they could. When the nets were well full, they would be hoisted up by a mechanical crane and lowered directly into the firebreather, a barge with a large rectangular incinerator on top. The abominations, with their disgusting bloated bodies would tumble down into to the fire and their ashes would be thrown to the sea. We would scrub the nets and repeat, over and over until the last monster was fished out of the water. When the nets would stop bringing them up, we would send a small detachment of divers to scout the area and pick off any lucky survivors with their spears.”\n\n“Now you will say, well, that's pretty easy! And I would say you are right! It was a joy to see those horrible creatures get consumed by the tonnage, my boys even drew a large dragon on the side of the firebreather and when we let them burn they would shout, holler and cheer.\"\n\nThe image of a fiery barge incinerating zombies is sure spectacular, yet I feel the urge to enquire as to the actual fighting the divers had to do. Giorgio nods, he knows what I'm about to ask.\n\n\"The thing is, not all of the seabed is flat, or sand. In fact, most areas are full of rocks, wrecks and all sorts of deathtraps for a net. Those were quite precious commodities so we avoided wasting them and only lowered them when we were sure they wouldn't snag onto anything. When they couldn't lower the nets, that's when we were truly called upon, that's when they asked to deploy us, the Poseidons.\"\n\nBefore trying to understand the way in which zombies were fought underwater, it is important to ascertain how they interacted with the ocean's floors. Although zombies are immune to the lack of air,  their sense of smell and hearing are mostly rendered useless at the bottom of the ocean. While on earth a Z could hear a man from half a mile away, underwater they were nothing more than bloated mobile masses, walking endlessly in a slow motion, sappy fever dream. Although this made them easier to kill, it is also a testament to their resilience, a Z could walk alone for years under the sea, marine life completely avoided them, even sharks dare not approach them.\n\nA standard Poseidon formation as it came to be known after the war quickly became the accepted method of effectively fighting Z under the water. The formation was composed of \"Heavy\" and \"Light\" units, acting in unison to bring down the threat. The first ones to submerge would be the \"heavies\". These were deep sea divers completely clad in a massive bronze and aluminum diving suit with a large copper helmet enveloping their head. On each side of the helmet each heavy had a \"Ulixes\" torch, a model that could light up even the most deep recess of the abyss.Their weaponry consisted of a large bronze shield and an inox iron spear, resembling that of an Ancient Greek hoplite or a Roman legionnaire. For backup, every heavy was armed with a 10 inch diving knife, one edge serrated to cut through netting and obstacles, or on occasion Z himself. While the heavy was slow, he could stay submerged for up to a day thanks to his carbon-scrubbing rebreather and was almost completely immune to bites, scratches and whatever the Z's could throw at them. After having made contact with the seabed, the heavies would gather into serrated ranks, their shields held in front of them and the spears poking out, forming an impenetrable phalanx. Following the heavies, the \"light\" units would submerge. Unlike their invulnerable brethren, the light divers only wore a neoprene diving wetsuit, which depending on the climate could be switched out for a hermetic one. Most \"lights\" sported a handheld torch, which they used to find Z and signal the heavies, together with a short spear or an axe. They had GAV inflatable jackets and lead-weighed belts to enable them to sink or float at will. Under most circumstances they looked exactly like a modern scuba diver, complete with fins, air tanks and diving torches. The light divers traded armor for mobility and were therefore the skirmishes of the formation, fanning out and attacking Z at will, harassing him and retreating, luring him toward the grinder of the waiting heavies. Giorgio was one of them.\n\n\"Once the lights would gather enough Z's they would start luring them towards us\". He explains;\n\n“In an ideal scenario we would have a good visibility and we could see them approaching and prepare our phalanx to face them. Still, as I've already told you, the sea makes her own rules to the games that people play. One moment we would have visibility as clear as day, the other a current of plankton would envelop us, making them impossible to see even if they were an inch from our nose. What guided us was mostly the torches of the light ones. They would signal to us where the heathen ones were and from where they would be approaching. It was important to have our phalanx always facing them because if the demons found our unshielded side it could often spell disaster. Many men I lost to an unseen bastard who crawled into our side. If the lights did their job good though, that often wouldn't be the case and we could face all of the fiends upfront...\n\nThat's when the fighting began.\n\nThe lights would scatter, either floating up and beginning their ascent or retreating behind our ranks, most of the time they would float above us, illuminating the zombies from above with their torches. Then the wall of dead would be upon us. It felt like a train smashing head on against our shields, we would hold fast, our lead-laced boots digging into the ground, our shield protecting us from their rotten teeth. The funny thing is, this was nothing like the combat you see on land, it was all in slow motion, slow but continuous, fluid movements both ours and Z's. It was a deadly struggle and yet there were no screams, no gunfire it was silent as night down there. Once Z had been stopped in his tracks we would raise our shields and start stabbing at their head with our long spears, killing them rank after rank putting them down into the seabed where they're supposed to be. What our spears couldn't finish we did with our knives, our boots or even our bare hands. Once I saw Morotz, one of my biggest lads, crush the head of a Z in his ironclad fist.\"\n\nAlthough the Poseidons were unrivaled fighting machines, losing only 15 of their 300-strong unit in the whole war, operating at depths of up to 2000 meters under the sea demanded quite a complicated logistics system to keep them alive at that depth and to make their fighting force effective. That's something I ask Giorgio, who indeed seems to be well-versed on the subject.\n\n\"Due to the slow nature of the fighting that took place down there, it often took days to clear an area of heathens, which is why we set up \"camp\" a few hundred meters under the surface. Now \"camp\", is nothing as you imagine it. It's intended as a pressurized hyperbaric chamber, suspended by cable to one of our tugboats. When the fighting was over for the day, we would all ascend to \"camp\" where we could decompress, lose the nitrogen in our system and make preparations for the following day.\"\n\nDecompression is necessary to every diver, from the deep sea heavies to a recreational scuba. When a person is submerged for a certain amount of time little bubbles of nitrogen start forming in the bloodstream and if one was to emerge suddenly, these would expand owing to the reduced pressure and obstruct vessels and veins, risking to kill the person. An experienced diver knows this sickness very well.\n\n\"We took decompression religiously. I would have rather left one of my guys behind and have one less heavy than risk a decompression sickness on my hands. It's a horrible way to go and it would spell the end of whatever operation we were conducting, not to mention kill the morale of my guys. Sometimes, when an operation was over we had to decompress for days, these were pretty boring and most of us stashed all manners of books and magazines in the hold. It was a down time to our work, we trained to kill but all we had to kill in there was time. It did give me time to think however, as it's in here that I thought up the phalanx, the light and heavies and all that was our fighting doctrine, every time I emerged in the chamber I had ample time to learn from the mistakes we made and perfect our tactics. In the end, a ship is only as good as it's crew and I could use this time to deal with my men on a personal level. I could see who was in a good mood, who wasn't and why, I tried my best to keep their morale high, that's when they fought best.\"\n\nI now move on to another topic. I feel like I've explored the past enough and I'm sure it must have been quite taxing for Pellizzari. I ask him about the future and what he sees of it. Considering the Poseidons have now been disbanded, replaced by professional Navy units.\n\n \"I was assigned mostly ex Navy guys myself, or whatever deep sea divers had survived the Z war, cable repairmen, ship technicians, even the occasional recreational diver, they were all welcome in my crew...Now that our job is mostly done they all moved on to other pursuits, there are many damaged oil rigs out there, still broken and leaking, cables tore to pieces by the undead.They're wherever mankind needs them to be honestly, and I think it's all for the best. Today I look at my son Giorgio and I hope he grows up in a world that is more than thrusting spears at things. I hope he will develop a culture and master the arts, I hope he will find a job that has nothing to do with the heathen ones at all. Should they rise again, I warn them, while many shall kill them on land, I shall hunt them to the deepest abyss down to the pit of hell itself if necessary.\n\nI’m about to leave, Pellizzari has given me all that I needed and a very significant piece of history, not to mention a lesson learned shall the Z’s decide to infect humanity again. Before I go I have one last question, something unrelated that has always fascinated me. I ask Pellizzari if he’s ever seen things down there, things that no one has ever seen before. \n\nI was half expecting a sardonic remark, something sarcastic or funny, but the man gave me a look that was all the opposite. He seemed to pause on this one and then, almost by surprise gives me an answer I was not expecting. \n\n“Once, and only once. We were at 5,000 meters down and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a hallucination caused by the nitrogen in our blood, but I’m pretty sure we all saw it. It’s eye was as big as one of our shields, tentacles, numerous and thick as a tree, they must have been longer than one of our tugboats. It came close, I think it was just curious. We poked at it with our spears and one of my guys pierced it’s eye. It left in a flurry, an abomination never to be seen again. Never forget, that to this day we know more about the surface of the moon than we do what lies at the bottom of the sea.”",

    "passage": "Mad Villainy [MS]\n\nStory 1 - Mad Villainy\n\nI. Spitz\n\nDetective Daniel Barrett Spitz woke up, on the morning of January 19th, 2003, to his clock radio. The old thing hummed away, a soft, firm male voice informing the city of the latest happenings, mostly surrounding DOOM. “... And last night, yet another of DOOM’s masked robberies occurred at 19th and Main. Citizens are urged to stay cautious, and to alert the police of any suspicious activities... “. Daniel’s weary, lined face frowned a bit, his sunken eyes staying still in their dark sockets.\nDetective Spitz quickly rose out of bed, jumping to attention and performing 50 perfect jumping jacks to jolt himself awake. The rotting floor beneath him gave way to his bare, cold feet just a bit. Grabbing a worn but clean towel from his drawer, Daniel heads off to his bathroom and finishes getting ready, donning his nearly antique but well maintained leather jacket that matched his skin eerily, making him blend in almost suspiciously well.\n\nII. DOOM\n\nDwight Dumile awoke in a pile of bloody cash and cassette tapes in his underground bunker, deep beneath the city. Wearing a bathrobe and slippers, he stripped and got into a chemical shower, which quickly sterilized him before he put on a loose pair of brand new cargo pants and an oversized XXL hoodie. He then affixed a metallic mask over his expressionless features. Daniel, now DOOM, walked over to his pneumatic tubes and collected the newspapers that feature his exploits in their headlines. They all spelled his name correctly now, in all caps. Not that DOOM had given them much of a choice.\n\nIII. Famsar\n\nSgt. Angelo Famsar picked up his cell phone, the time reading 9:02 AM, the date January 19th. His job in the city’s Robbery Squad afforded him a nice office, which was all the better for taking his calls. Famsar had two types of calls that ever came in through his work cell phone: orders from DOOM, and transfer orders for the heroine warehouse he ran for DOOM. The caller ID read DOOM, and not any of the various distributors, so he could most likely expect the former.\n\t“Hello?”. Angelo frowned as he heard something that sounded vaguely like chewing coming from the other end of the call. “Sir?”.\n\t“Yeah, it’s me.”. DOOM’s calls were almost always a bit bizarre. Angelo was one of the few people who heard DOOM speak on a regular basis. Angelo heard what sounded like DOOM popping open a beer. “I need you to schedule a meeting with Detective Spitz”.\n\t“Spitz?”. Famsar frowned. “If you like, sir, but he’s probably the cleanest cop on the force.”. Famsar chuckled nervously. “He’ll be able to sniff me out like a bloodhound”.\n\t“Meet with him. Tell him that his indiscretions have been noticed. Then dismiss him. No further communication”.\n\t“Yes, sir”. Angelo hears a click on the other end and quickly calls in his secretary to go retrieve Detective Spitz.\n\nIV. Spitz\n\nHow did Famsar know? The knowing look could have been anything, anything at all. But Daniel knew that he followed every strict guideline of the force. On the job, he was the cleanest cop on the force. Maybe they’d noticed his bruised, scabby knuckles, and Angelo just took a shot in the dark trying to make Spitz clean up his act before something happened. Angelo might have looked a bit like your stereotypical scuzzy, dirty cop, but Daniel was sure that he was clean. It’s possible that one of the targets Daniel had threatened recently had tried to turn him in, possibly even tried to get off free by accusing Daniel of beating him, but it seemed unlikely; people don’t snitch on Spitz, especially those who value their lives. DOOM doesn’t treat people who snitch on his men very well.\n\nV. DOOM\n\nThe phone only ever needed to ring once for DOOM’s call to be accepted. It was an unwritten rule that it seemed DOOM’s cronies had all independently arrived at, and it seemed no different for Mr. Spitz.\n “... And then he told me that my indiscretions had been noticed. Not to undermine you, sir, but you told me that if I did exactly as you said, there would be no chance of me being caught.”.\nDOOM rolls his eyes, even though they aren’t very visible through his eye holes and no one was watching. “Then obviously you didn’t do exactly what I said, Daniel. Besides, he said indiscretions, he didn’t accuse you of anything specific”.\n“I understand, sir. Should I take any action at this time?”\n“I need you to do a job tonight. Easy. Target will be in warehouse B at 8:30. Arrive at 8:00 to acclimate yourself, and make sure he can’t leave the warehouse unless he’s on a gurney”.\n“Understood”.\n\nVI. Famsar\n\nAround midday, Angelo received a call from DOOM, telling him to waste his night going to the damned warehouse again. How many times had he checked inventory at the warehouse? Wasn’t it enough for the warehouse’s permanent staff to be making sure that all their heroine was safe and sound in little baggies, packed tight into hoodlums’ jackets travelling through the city? Of course, Angelo had quickly accepted. Anything else would be suicide. It had been a while anyway, and Angelo was getting a bit rusty with his spot checks. Truth be told, he hadn’t been to warehouse B in almost 2 months now. His surveillance on Spitz had come to an end today when Spitz had to go out for something or another, maybe chasing another useless lead. Over 75 percent of the cases in the precinct, or covered by Famsar’s squad, had some loose connection to DOOM. Not that Angelo had ever let any detectives know that. He might not have looked like it, but Angelo tended to see himself as an intelligent man. He planned his moves ahead, and didn’t trust anyone. Still, he could see no possible danger in checking the warehouse tonight.\n\nVII. DOOM\n\nDOOM really was sad to see one of the gentlemen go. But they had their time on his payroll, and DOOM didn’t like to take chances. Both were unflinchingly loyal, both had never wronged him. Yet Famsar seemed to be getting a bit comfortable in his position, and it seemed only eventual that he would make a mistake. And Spitz, of course, couldn’t be trust just by his very nature. A man who beat strangers for a living would not hesitate to beat a man who has actively wronged him, and it seemed unlikely that Detective Spitz would survive much longer anyway, with so many enemies. But after the warehouse, Spitz would either be on his way to a graveyard or out of the country. These things had a way of resolving themselves once DOOM got involved. DOOM thought for another moment and decided he deserved another beer, and cracked open another cold one.\n\nVII. Spitz\n\nDetective Spitz arrived a bit early to the warehouse. He knew that DOOM had stopped operations in the warehouse a month or so ago, or at least that’s what he was able to glean from various targets that DOOM had him interrogate. The warehouse was wiped clean, with no sign that it had ever been used for anything except housing goods. Allowing himself 10 minutes for his eyes to adjust to the darkness, he waited for his target to arrive at the warehouse through the only open entrance in the warehouse. Spitz glanced down at his watch, barely able to read the time in the darkness. 8:10. Whoever would walk through that door at 8:30 would be poorly acclimated to the darkness, so it seemed plausible that Spitz would be able to take him down without a gunshot, which would definitely work in his favor. Gunshots in the city didn’t go unnoticed, even in a district with many warehouses.\n\nA ridiculously loud crack burst out somewhere in Spitz’ vicinity causing him to spin quickly. Before he fell, Spitz recognized it dimly as a gunshot. It started really hurting when he hit the ground with a thud that he felt but didn’t hear. Facedown on the ground, his ears ringing, Spitz was bleeding out, the gunshot in his side pulsing with pain as he tried to twist his head around to see if he could at least view the man who hurt him. Spitz died trying.\n\nIX. Famsar\n\nIf Angelo had been surprised that the warehouse was empty, he had been even more surprised that Detective Spitz had mosied on in, letting his eyes adjust in a similar way to how he had done. Staying as still as possible about 10 feet behind Spitz, Angelo had eventually concluded that Spitz must have been sent to kill him, mostly because of the way he was watching that door. Police don’t wait by a door in the dark, in plain clothes in abandoned warehouse at night. And it was fairly obvious that Spitz thought that his target would be arriving later than he was, that much was fairly obvious. Famsar hypothesized that perhaps Spitz was planning on using the element of surprise, combined with the fact that his “victim” would not be able to see as well as he would. It also seemed fairly obvious that DOOM had somehow orchestrated this. Angelo had gotten lazy with the warehouse checks, and hadn’t even noticed that this one had been shut down. Stupid, stupid. So the only move Angelo thought would be a surefire temporary win for himself would be to shoot Detective Daniel Spitz in the back, which he did with a shaking hand. After he saw the man drop to the ground, he stepped over his body and fled the warehouse.",

    "passage": "[RF] The following contains elements of fiction. The frog is real.\n\nThe following contains elements of fiction. The frog is real. \n\nMy trip started off especially well. Sunday afternoon, weather perfect. My new friends at the landing contributed to a pleasant launch. \n\nI packed a ton of gear, enough to require the addition of a pull behind raft. It’s a bit of a drag on long paddles but I sure can get a lot of stuff in a raft.\n\nI decided to try a new area that looked really good on the satellite photo but turned out not to suit my preferences. Old age pickiness made me venture on.\n\nAfter nearly 4 hours of paddling, I finally arrived at one of my all-time favorite campsites. Words fail. The joy of finding it unoccupied has to be felt in person. \n\nIt had everything. An easy landing. A separate sandy swim beach. The perfect spot to hang a hammock with a view. And tons of soft, friendly trails. \n\nMy first evening was spent pitching my tent, hitching myhammock, hanging my screen tent without the poles, and making a serviceable table. M’new home. \n\nTime for bed. I left my rain fly off to gaze the stars. Slept pretty good. Midnight sprinkles got me up long enough to install the rainfly. Back to sleep. \n\nIn the morning it was raining steady and hard. I quick boiled some coffee and hunkered back down in my one man, coffin sized, back packing tent. All day. \n\nAs I lay there listening to the rain and waiting for the soggy hours to pass, something bounced off my tent. A few secondslater, it happened again\n\nCan’t just let something like that go. No idea what it could be. Robed. Unzipped, and stepped outside for the first time in hours. There he was.\n\n“hello little froggie.” Was that you bouncing off my tent? How you doin’? Never had a frog campmate before. It’s nice having company. Someone to talk to.\n\n“Well thank you,” he said. \nYes, I could hear what the little frog was saying. Clear as now. I’m not saying he was an actual talking frog, I’m just saying I could hear him. Call me crazy.\n\n“I hit your tent” he said, “so you’d come out and see that the rain is puddlin’ near your little nylon nest and you’re gonna be laying in water real soon”. \n\nIt was obvious I had to move my tent to higher ground. In the rain. Good thing I prepared for wet. Suited up I went to work. Just in time. “Thank you, froggie.” \n\nMoving around is better than laying around so I didn’t really mind the work.     I moved my tent my tarps and my table and set up my kitchen and pantry.\n\nWhen my task was completed, I was very happy. My tent was nestled in a grove of pine trees on the ridge overlooking the beach. My beach. Feng Hoppin Shui! \n\nThru it all, froggie hung around. Odd, but true. Nice having him around. “Hey froggie, throw me a tent stake”. Sorry. Forgot you were a frog. “Very funny”.\n\nAfter lunch, the rain finally stopped and it was a real niceevening. Camp fire. A few stars. Grilled steak. Mac ‘n cheese. Fruit and cookies. Beer. Beer. Bed.\n\nTuesday started beautiful. Chip (his new name) hung around as I prepared a satisfying camp breakfast. Biscuits &amp; Gravy, bacon, coffee, milk, juice. Ahhh.\n\nWell fed, I was ready to explore. I packed snacks, water, and a heavy duty plastic bag for gathering firewood, and paddled off into virgin territory. \n\nModern humans (me at least) get so few opportunities for real adventure. That’s one of the reasons I go to the Flowage. This place can kick butt, if it wants to.\n\nAs I sit at home planning these trips, I say I hope that some unexpected challenge will arise for me to overcome. Sounds romantic sitting on the couch. \n\nBut when my wilderness wishes do come true, I Hate it. At least while it is happening. Panic and Fear are Strong Emotions. But, when it is finally over,… \nNo better feeling. \nI’ve experienced hellatious storms, lightning strikes so close I couldn’t breathe, waves breaking over the sides of my kayak, and trees falling over in the night.\n\nAnd getting Lost. It’s easy to do. Large wilderness water, with a maze of islands, and everything looks confusingly different from afar and all the same close up. \n\nI’ve been lost on the Flowage before but Tuesday I got serious lost. I dug out my compass desperately hoping that it would help but I just got more confused. \n\nEver been really lost all alone? No car. No phone. Nobody to ask for directions. Not even a dog to keep you company. A real test of one’s calmabilities.\n\nI won’t make you suffer the details but it was hard, confusing, tiring, and in a strangely profound way belittling.                                         I finally got found.\n\nHaving identified my location, it was time to get to work looking for firewood. Unoccupied campsites are the best. My map helped me find several in a row.\n\nIt is not uncommon to find that the last camper paddled home without finishing off his wood supply. Every once in a while you score big. \n\nAt one site I found half a dozen pieces of split, dried, real firewood. A luxury out in the wild where I usually have to scavenge the Island’s underbrush for sticks.\n\nI filled my large plastic bag with kindling and tinder and strapped a few big native limbs to the top of my kayak and headed happily home.  \n\nNote: When I collect firewood, I walk around and fill my bag with any good small stuff I can find. Twigs, wood chips, you get the idea. One of the best places to find good ‘bag’ stuff is inside the camp fire ring. Plenty of good chunks of charcoal and half burnt logs. The following story is true. \n\nThe last campsite I visited was recently abandoned and the fire pit was still smoldering. I pulled out a chunk of mostly burnt wood and banged it against the rim of the fire ring and knocked all the hot coals off before putting it in my bag.\n\nOn my paddle home, I realized my bag was on fire. Flames. Behind me in the kayak. Out of reach. The nearest land looks really far when you’re on fire. \n\nBy the time I jumped out, my plastic bag was mostly gone, I had to throw fistfuls of burning sticks into the water, and my kayak suffered melty burns. \n\nAs fun as it was, too bad nobody was there to witness an old man paddling like the devil with smoke billowing behind. Would have made an excellent video.\n\nBy the time I got back to camp, I was beat. I unloaded my wood, grabbed a container of trail mix and a bottle of water and zipped myself up in bed. Snug.\n\nWhen I woke up, it was brilliant. The stars were unbelievable. It was the night of the Perseid Meteor Shower and the sky was crystal clear and cookin’. \n\nSuch moments are Gifts.\nI grabbed my cushion and blanket and laid on the bluff overlooking the water. The heavens reflection on the still surface of the lake magnified my pleasure. \n\nAnd the meteors. The Shooting Stars. So often yet so sudden.They (almost) made me cry outloud. Further description could not do the experience justice.\n\nWednesday was fun. After breakfast and a relaxing cup of tea, I laid out my Island Golf course. I brought the balls but made my club. Holes were trees. \n\nThe first two holes were tricky; you could end up in the water. Chip designed the 3rd hole, a par five down the path to the john. Frogs. \n\nAs a kid growing up, I didn’t really have many friends to play with.                   I entertained myself. I think I’m pretty good at it. I have fun camping. \n\nGolf. Swim. Float. Fish. Eat. Snooze. Sun. Play. Eat. Drink. Paddle. Build a fire. Camp Life can be Good. \n\nThursday was a day of challenges. I was dan bound and determined to make fire with sticks. I’ve seen the videos. I gathered the materials. I made smoke. \n\nI tell myself I’m Happy I failed to make fire because it leaves an even more daunting challenge for me to face in the future. Hmmm. As I age, I accept a lot.\n\nNext Challenge. \nI decided to see if I could find an unnamed lake shown on themap, connected to the flowage by a thin blue line, the start of which was really far from camp.\n\nAfter much effort, I found the narrow opening that was the blue line. Barely wide enough for my kayak with just enough room to push through. Barely.\n\nThrough spider webs and bugs falling on me from the five foot tall scratchy grass engulfing me, I pushed and pulled, determined not to fail. \n\nDeeper in, trees formed a cool tunnel canopy. Twice I met obstacles that on lesser days would have turned my lesserdan back. Finally,.… like a miracle.\n\nNew dan lake. I figured that since I was probably the first to ever actually make it through, I should be the one to name it. It was a special place, a special time.\n\nOn the long paddle back, I sang that song I sing when I have a long paddle back to camp. I sing it over and over. It helps. The fish seem to like it. \n\nBack at camp, Chip informed me of a new problem. He hopped over to where my raft was stashed behind a bush. A seam had busted and it was no more. \n\nNot a big crisis, though Chip thought it was. Just a question of how to get all the gear back without the raft or making two trips. Something for us to ponder.\n\nThursday Night Feast. Pan fried crab cakes, buttered noodles, roasted corn on the cob, sliced tomato, and a fudge brownie for dessert. Sitting by the campfire.\n\nI find it satisfying to cook my meals over a campfire that I start with a spark or a lens. It takes planning and patience but the results are usually worth it. \n\nChip shared a beer with me as we talked by the fire. (I did most of the talking.) He did tell me he was happy. The simple life and all. “You Betcha”. Amen. \n\nSuddenly, a tremendous splash. Chip hopped and hit his head on a rock and I nearly fell on my butt. If it was a fish, it was unlike any I’ve ever experienced. \n\nThat night I laid awake in my tent for a long time listening to camp sounds.     It’s amazing what you can hear if you lay very still and focus. Slept well.\n\nFriday: STRONG WIND ADVISORY. (an opportunity) ((I’ve done this before))      I hard drove my kayak directly into the breaking waves. Soaked and laughing. \n\nI fought my way out as far as I could, then turned around and road the waves in like a surfboard. Two times. If I had a sail I could have flown. Hot Dog Rush. \n\nIn the evening, the wind finally died down. Thank God. It’s Maddening being outdoors in high sustained winds for nearly ten hours straight. Truly is.\n\nPleasant evening. Best campfire of the trip. When campingalone, it takes at least three nights before you fully realize the benefits of solitude. Night six.\n\nThat night was spent in quiet contemplation. Good thoughts of good things and people I love. Wilderness can be a kind companion. Slept good again.\n\nSaturday breakfast was beautiful. Fried potatoes, bacon, eggs, and juice. It’s almost magical the way camping makeseverything taste so good. Chip agreed.  \n\nI headed down to the landing to wash my dishes when all of asudden I stopped dead in my tracks. A monster fish was lying in the shadow of a downed tree. \n\nSlowly, slowly I backed away to the tree my pole was leaning against. It was rigged with a worm hook but my worms and other tackle were too far away.\n\nI had no choice. The hooked pierced his neck under his bottom lip and he landed splash not two feet from the beast. He desperately kicked his legs once and wham, fish on. I screamed from the splash, set the hook, and let loose the drag. He took off like a rocket and my line sung as it played out. “HOLD ON CHIP. DON’T LET HIM GO”. \n\nI don’t know how long the fight lasted, but that day I landed the biggest fish of my life. Before I let him go, I lovingly removed Chip’s remains from his throat. \n\nYou can call me sissy or whatever you want but I cried when I buried what was left of him. He was more than just a good campmate. He was a giving friend. \n \n",
